<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A clear</span> but brief November day had ended.
Though not yet six o'clock, the sky was almost
without color, and a slender silver crescent just
above the trees, almost as one looked, grew sharp
and filled with light. A young girl, who was sitting
at a window, with her fair, round cheek close
against the pane, looking idly out at the falling
leaves and the darkening landscape, lifted her
head suddenly, and saw the new moon and
started.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, it's over my left shoulder!" she
exclaimed, petulantly. "What horrid ill-luck are
we going to have? It never fails. I hate to see
it over my left shoulder."</p>

<p>The words she said chimed in uncomfortably
with the thoughts of the lady whom she addressed.
There was a third person in the room,&mdash;another
young girl, seated at a piano, playing softly in the
twilight, so absorbed that her younger sister's exclamation

<!-- page 2 -->

did not draw her attention. The lady
by the fire did not turn her head, but shivered a
little, and said, reproachfully, after a moment,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you must have seen it over the other
shoulder uninterruptedly for the last sixteen years.
I don't know anybody who's had better luck than
you, Honor; or, for the matter of that, than all of
us."</p>

<p>"It depends upon what you call good luck,"
said Honor. But she did not continue the subject,
having very little to say on her side of the
question; and, besides, it was not an hour to talk.
So she leaned against the pane, and gazed out at
the silver thread in the clear sky, and at the vine
clinging to the wall, from which the leaves were
dropping at every breath of the now sinking wind,
and thought her own young thoughts. The room
was at the front of the house, and the window at
which Honor sat looked out upon the entrance.
Up to this she expected every moment to see the
carriage drive, bringing her father from his day's
toil in the city. This room was a library, with
warm, dark walls and a good many pictures; there
was no lamp in it, but a fire blazed on the wide
hearth. Beyond was a dark room, and beyond
that, again, was the dining-room, lighted with
shaded lamps. A glimmer of silver and glass
and a quietly moving maid told of the coming
dinner-hour. The mother, sunk in her deep chair
before the fire, had been looking around the walls

<!-- page 3 -->

of the room, all encrusted as they were with the
ornament of sentiment, that had grown on them
with time as lichen grows on stones. She followed
the fire-light as it fell on her fair-haired
daughter, whose fingers touched the keys, and on
the slender young creature who leaned against the
window; on the dog at her feet, who lay gazing at
the blaze. She loved the smell of the wood as the
sap oozed from it, of the flowers that stood on
the table across the room, even the scent of cigar
smoke in the book that lay upon her lap. They
were the smells of home, the sights of home, and
they were dear to her. She remembered twilights
long ago in this very room, when the girl at the
piano had scarcely reached the keys standing on
the points of her tiny toes; when Honor, in her
nurse's arms, had drummed on the pane waiting
for papa at that very window. For years the
sap had smelled like that, and the flowers had
lived and died for generations of flower life in
those very vases; the cigars that had been smoked
by this very fireside, with long talks and midnight
confidences, as she sat beside her once young husband,&mdash;who
could count or recall them? Yes, she
had had a peaceful home, a sheltered life, prosperous
to the world's eye, more prosperous, even, to
the soul's sense. Her children!&mdash;she always
looked at them with such a gaze of love and satisfaction
that it must have been like sunshine and
ripened them, one would think. There had been

<!-- page 4 -->

but one break in the family life, while the only
son of the house had been away in the usual exile
of school and college days. But that was nearly
over now; in a few months he would be at home
again, and they would be complete.</p>

<p>Complete! That was the word she had been
saying over to herself with a sort of fear just before
Honor caught sight of the moon in that unlucky
attitude. What life could be more complete
than hers? Who had ever had a fuller one?
Everything about her, from the lovely contour of
Lucy's head, to the soft depths of the chair that
yielded to her faintest movement, gave her a sense
of satisfaction, of security, of comfort. Just at
that moment, when her senses were so satisfied,
her heart so contented, there came a vague note of
alarm, like a knock at the outer gate. She put it
aside, but the faint, muffled sound had shocked
her nerves; she could not get it out of her ears.</p>

<p>And then Honor had spoken. Her silly little
superstition irritated her mother, as it joined itself
to the train of thought that she was trying to banish.
She was glad when the sound of the wheels
outside came, and Honor sprang from the window
and ran into the hall to meet her father, and Lucy
left the piano and followed her. A great rush of
cold air came in before the outside door was closed.
The girls' sweet, merry voices were all she heard
for a moment, as she moved forward to the library
door. She detected, before he had passed the

<!-- page 5 -->

threshold, a harsh tone in the father's brief answer
to their pleasantry. When she kissed him, he
scarcely returned the caress, and did not look at
her. When the firelight shone on his face she
saw that it was pale. She had too much tact to
say, You are not well. His was too reserved a nature
to be reached by direct routes or rapid moves.
She must wait to know what troubled him till
they are alone, and till he chose to speak. But
speculation was not idle. She sat down again in
her chair, and a hundred alarms passed through
her brain. Lucy always went with her father to
his dressing-room, and saw that it was lighted and
that he had all he needed. How she wished she
could to-night take Lucy's place, and shorten her
suspense! Presently Lucy came down, and ordered
dinner put upon the table, and went and sat
on the other side of the fire, while Honor was tearing
open some letters by the dining-room light.</p>

<p>"Papa seems tired," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"He is very busy this week," said her mother.
"I suppose he has been in court all day."</p>

<p>And then they were silent. When he came
down he did not stop at the library fire, but saying
that he supposed dinner was ready walked directly
in to the table, and they followed him. At dinner
he was unwontedly critical of the food, eating
little, and not attempting to talk, answering his
daughters' questions shortly and absently. He
never made any disguise of his feelings when anything

<!-- page 6 -->

troubled him; an effort at gayety or interest
in passing matters he never thought of. His
wife watched carefully, and tried to judge whether
some serious professional disappointment had occurred,
or some matter of more personal concern.
Honor attempted once or twice to draw his attention
by a half impertinence, which, as the youngest
in the family, was in a way her privilege. Lucy
looked troubled, and tried to talk on matters that
would engage them all safely. At last Honor said
abruptly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any news from Barry to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, shortly, not absently,
nor as if his thoughts had been called from somewhere
else.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did you not tell us before! Show me
the letter, papa. Or is it in your overcoat pocket?
May I run and get it?" And she half rose from
the table.</p>

<p>"I have no letter from him," he answered.
"Sit down."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, a little confused by his unusual
manner. "I&mdash;thought you meant you had had
a letter from him."</p>

<p>"Barry is not ill?" said the mother, startled
out of her resolution to be silent.</p>

<p>"I have not heard of it, if he is," returned her
husband, not looking at her, as he poured out a
glass of wine.</p>

<p>Then she knew that the trouble was about

<!-- page 7 -->

Barry, and that it was not illness. She was so
materially and inbornly a mother that the first
feeling was one of relief. If that dear flesh that
she had nourished and cherished was safe and
well, she could bear all the rest. Barry had done
something to displease his father. That was hard
to know; but it would come right. Whereas if
he had typhoid fever, or had broken his collar
bone, it would be much less certain to do so. She
thought his father was severe in his judgment of
Barry, always; not from lack of love, but from
excess of it, and from an ambition that was not
measured by probabilities. Two male human
beings could not be more dissimilar than they
were. The father was sternly intellectual, with an
intellectual man's temptations and provocations.
The son seemed to have considerable mental force,
but withal put in such an overpowering mortal
mould that the balance was always wavering between
the two. He was so fine an athlete that
even his masters forgave him for not being a student.
You began by admiring his mind, and you
ended by admiring his body. You condemned his
indolence, and you found your eyes following him
with perfect satisfaction. How could you blame
a youth for not trying for the first prize in Greek,
when without trying he could get the first prize
in everything else outside? But his father blamed
him, and could see no excuse for his lack of ambition.
He himself had never known the temptation

<!-- page 8 -->

of pleasure-seeking. It simply offered no attraction
for him. Work and rest were the two
poles of his battery. An early and satisfying
marriage had closed the door of the world to him,
which, however, no loneliness would ever have
driven him to open. It never would have occurred
to him that recreation or solace could be
found in society; he would as soon have thought
of burrowing in the earth for it. With a generous
confidence in the allotments of fate, he took it for
granted that his only son was the exact pattern of
himself, and looked forward to his career as his
own amplified and made perfect by the removal
of obstacles. In all his professional life, he had
one guiding purpose,&mdash;Barry's future. And when
this superb young animal, with undoubted abilities,
but undoubted distaste for using them, was
launched on his college career, and made himself
adored of everybody, but ahead of nobody (in
Greek), he grew hard towards him, and bitter.
The mother had need of all her tact and patience
to mediate between the two. But her efforts had
not been fruitless. Just in his last year he had
roused himself, more from affectionate desire to
please them than from any other motive, perhaps,
and had done so well as to surprise and pacify his
father. Now he was away, studying at a law
school in a remote country town, it being a fancy
of his father's that there, at least, he would be free
from the distractions of society.</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p>It must not be supposed that Barry had shown
himself a wild and reckless fellow. On the contrary,
he seemed a son to be proud of, if one would
take him as the gift of heaven, and not as a
manufacture of one's own. He did not fill his
father's bill, certainly, but that was scarcely his
fault, as it would have been necessary for him to
make himself over <i>da capo</i>, to accomplish that,
and at twenty one does not take to reconstruction
kindly. Barry loved his father, and wanted to
please him; but as he could only do so by giving
up every impulse of his nature, and acting upon
impulses which he did not feel, and only faintly
wished he could feel, it was disheartening work,
and he naturally had no enthusiasm for it.</p>

<p>Just now, however, things were working better.
They had good reports of him from the remote
country law school, and his father's hopes were reviving.
That some disappointing account of his
want of application to his studies had come was
the worst his mother feared. It was very bad,
very discouraging, certainly, but it would come
out all right. Since he wasn't ill, bless him, she
could bear it, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>After dinner, she played a duet with Lucy;
she had a long consultation with Honor about the
crewels for her screen; she read, or tried to read,
the evening paper. By half-past nine o'clock she
acknowledged to herself that she cared more than
she thought, and that the suspense was fretting

<!-- page 10 -->

her unbearably. Lucy saw it, and managed to
draw Honor up-stairs a half hour earlier than
usual, and husband and wife were left alone together.</p>

<p>Mr. Crittenden had been sitting at a small
table beside the fire, looking over some papers.
His wife knew very well he was only making a
pretense of occupation. It was no real work. He
pushed the papers into a drawer, at last, and leaned
back in his chair. He looked across at her where
she sat, and their eyes met. She had not pledged
herself to anything but silence; she let her eyes
fasten on his with an anxious appeal.</p>

<p>"I have some pretty news for you," he said,
after a few moments, in a hard, grating tone.</p>

<p>"You won't make it any prettier by keeping
it from me, will you?" she said, in a suppressed
voice.</p>

<p>"I haven't kept it any longer than was necessary.
It isn't exactly the kind of news one
would lay before young girls."</p>

<p>And then he paused again. From being the defender
and advocate of Barry for so long, Mr. Crittenden
had come to have the tone of regarding his
wife as a partner in his son's misdemeanors. She
had made light of his faults so often, that her husband
naturally felt they did not pain her, and it was
with a feeling that he was the only one wounded,
and not with any wish to spare her, but rather as
one injured, that he always made his complaints.</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<p>"I ought to have been prepared for this, but
I confess I wasn't. I might have known there
was but one natural result of a life without purpose."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden got up and walked once or twice
across the room, then sat down resolutely and
folded her hands, and looked into the fire with
sealed lips.</p>

<p>"You and I have never agreed about this matter,"
he went on. "I have never been able to
make you understand the dangers of your method
with the boy. I can't expect your sympathy with
my disappointments."</p>

<p>"I have not been disappointed," she said, stoutly.
"I see no reason to despair of Barry. He isn't
what we meant him to be, but he's a fine fellow
for all that, and one whom any father might be
proud of."</p>

<p>There was a bitter sneer in the father's tone as
he said, "A particularly fine fellow; the pride of
any household. Read that."</p>

<p>And he laid upon the table a letter. His wife
got up and went to the light and took it up. It
was in an unfamiliar hand, a man's, and bore
the postmark of the town where the law school
was. She opened it and read it, standing by the
lamp. As she read, her breath came quicker. She
put out one hand and steadied herself by a chair
that stood beside her. When her eyes had flashed
through the letter once, she let go the chair for an

<!-- page 12 -->

instant to turn back the page and re-read it. She
was generally self-controlled, and she counted upon
her strength, but for once she had overrated it.
She reeled a little when she lost the support,
dropped the letter, and sank into the chair. Then
she sat quite still, her eyes on the floor, the color
surging up into her face and going back again.
Her husband, full of his own trouble, was not
looking at her. She had never allowed him to
pity her before in the matter of Barry; he did
not think of beginning now.</p>

<p>"I haven't answered the letter yet," he said,
"but something must be done." He got up and
went to the fire, and replaced a stick that had
rolled down. "Something must be done at once,"
he said, standing and looking into the fire. "We'll
have to send him away from there. We might
as well face it. We'll have our hands full keeping
him out of trouble. This is but the beginning."</p>

<p>As she did not answer him, he added, after
a moment, a little impatiently, "I suppose it
doesn't surprise you?"</p>

<p>"I feel ill," she said, speaking in a faint voice.
"One of those attacks is coming on. Give me a
glass of water, will you?"</p>

<p>He went across to the dining-room to get the
water, thinking as he went that it was an unfortunate
time for her to have one of her attacks just
when it was necessary for him to talk this matter

<!-- page 13 -->

over with her. He didn't associate the attack
with his pretty news in any other way. She had
always been so brave about Barry, it was not altogether
to be wondered at. When he came back
and gave the water to her, she drank it, and seemed
better. He hoped the attack wasn't coming on,
after all.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better?" he asked.</p>

<p>She said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet a few minutes, then, and perhaps
it will pass over. I want you to be able to settle
with me what's to be done about this matter.
You would not be satisfied to leave it to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward, don't be cruel to me!" she exclaimed,
burying her face in her hands. He went
quickly to her, and bent over her. She caught
his hand, shivering and crying.</p>

<p>"This blow will kill me," she moaned. "Help
me! help me!" He put his arms around her, and
she clung to him. The "dull, hard stone" within
him melted as he felt her tears, and his own eyes
filled with the slow, unaccustomed moisture.</p>

<p>One feels as if children must have some fatal
penalty to pay for calling forth the awful tears of
disappointed parental love.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">A PRETTY PIECE OF NEWS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter was from one of the professors of the
law school, who had been a classmate of Mr. Crittenden's,
and to whom he had written when Barry
went there to pursue his unbeloved studies. There
was no intimacy between the two men. There
had been a strong rivalry in youth, but the city
lawyer had so distanced the country professor
that all that had died out. The unsuccessful man
was none the less convinced of his own merits;
the successful man always felt that perhaps luck
had been unduly on his side. The latter had felt
a faint hesitation in asking the professor to look
a little after Barry, when he sent him to the law
school. The people who have been important to
us in our youth always retain a certain prominence
in our minds. Few men of Mr. Crittenden's acquaintance
were of less worldly importance than
Professor Smythe, but from few of them would it
have been as painful to him to receive the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Crittenden</span>,&mdash;When your son introduced
himself to me, and presented your letter

<!-- page 15 -->

commending him in a measure to my care, I
felt as if it would not be much that would be required
of me, besides enjoying the sight of and
occasional intercourse with such a fine young fellow.
I have not written before in answer to it,
because, in fact, the letter did not seem to require
an answer, and because the young man seemed to
be doing so well as to make it superfluous to send
you any report of him. Within a few days,
however, such a painful rumor has reached my
ears that I cannot feel myself justified in letting
you remain in ignorance of it. When I speak of
rumor, I must add that it is not of mere report I
speak; but before writing I have taken pains to
verify the story, and not to distress you unnecessarily.</p>

<p>You will remember that last summer your son
and a companion went off on a walking expedition
during the vacation. Their journey did not extend
very far. I am told that they, or at least he,
did not go farther than Malden, a small farming
village about twelve miles from here, and there
spent the entire three weeks. He has, I believe,
been there at various times during the autumn.
Latterly, I have noticed in him an unusual application
to study, and a gravity, I might almost
say anxiety. I know very little of the lives of the
young men, and am not thrown at all with them
except in the lecture-room, and I knew nothing of
this matter till it had become town talk, and of

<!-- page 16 -->

such importance as to reach my ears. It appears
that the ruin of a young girl living somewhere
near Malden is laid to his charge, and that the
people of the neighborhood are much excited by
the fact. She is the daughter of a widow, and
has no brother or near male relative, or I suppose
there would have been some scene of violence.
According to the popular idea, however, this only
makes the worse case against him. I must add, I
understand the young woman to have borne a good
character hitherto, and to belong to an entirely
respectable family, though in very humble circumstances.</p>

<p>I need not say, my dear Crittenden, how painful
it has been to me to write of this to you, but
I have felt it my duty to let you know the facts.
You will understand enough of life in a small
town to know that it is not wise for him to remain
longer here, and I fancy, by withdrawing him
at once and quietly, the scandal of an expulsion
can be avoided. You know you may command
my friendship in the matter to the utmost.</p>

<p class="right">I am yours faithfully,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Erastus B. Smythe</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>It was late at night when Mrs. Crittenden re-read
this letter alone in her dressing-room. The
agitating talk had worn her husband out, and had
left her worse than sleepless. While he slept,
exhausted, she paced the floor in ever-increasing

<!-- page 17 -->

distress of mind. The night wore on, and found
her still up, still unable to accustom herself to the
thought of what had befallen them, still unreconciled
to the Power that had not restrained her
child from sin in answer to her prayers. This
room, above all others in the house, was associated
with those prayers. She turned with a bitter
heart from the sight of the prayer-desk where she
always knelt. His picture lay under the cross, and
had lain hidden there ever since he left her first.
There was a feeling in her heart that Heaven
would understand it as a mute prayer for him
every hour and moment of the day that she could
not pray for him with words. There came back
to her some words of yesterday's Psalter. They
had been sounding in her ears all day, in an unmeaning,
unappropriated way, just as words. "No
man may deliver his brother, nor make agreement
unto God for him. For it cost more to redeem
their souls, so that he must let that alone forever."</p>

<p>She had tried to make agreement; she had
failed. Had her faith been a childish one? It had
lasted so many years; she had been so confident,
so patient. It was late to begin to know what
and who to believe in. It was hard to have spent
a life-time in a service, and to find out in a minute
there had been neither master, nor wages, nor rules,
except in credulous fancy.</p>

<p>She thought of other women whom she knew,
commonplace, easy women of the world, whose

<!-- page 18 -->

sons had turned out good and honorable men;
who had never had this horror, this shame of heart,
this burden of inward degradation, to bear. Oh,
those prayers,&mdash;what had they availed? Those
petitionings of Heaven day and night,&mdash;what
answer had they got?</p>

<p>She was a woman whose serene dignity gave no
idea of the depths of her emotional nature. People
said she was just to her children rather than
enthusiastic about them. No one, perhaps, not
even her husband, suspected the absorbing nature
of her love; the romance, the poem, that each
young life was to her. Her pride and reserve
made it more possible for her to conceal it from
herself than to reveal it to others. And she had
so concealed it. She only saw when the knowledge
of her son's fall came to her how high had
been the place she had given him, what an impossible
perfection she had required of him.</p>

<p>She pulled from her dress a miniature that she
had worn ever since he was a baby; she did not
look at it, but shut it up in a drawer and locked
it in. No one knew that she had worn it. She
wished she could forget that she had. She turned
from his picture on the wall. If he had been
dead it would have been easier to look at it. To
do her justice, it was in no wise the scandal that
abased her. She had not come to regard that yet.
But it was the sin, the deception, the grossness
of the fall. She was so much a woman that she

<!-- page 19 -->

felt she could have yearned over and longed for
him if he had been in prison for some dishonorable
sin for lucre. But she did not yearn over
him now. She did not long for him. She felt
estranged, turned cold and unnatural.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"As if, fond leaning where her infant slept,<br/>

A mother's arm a serpent should embrace."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>She had made so many excuses for him. She
had had such full faith in his goodness of nature,
such patience with his light-heartedness and love
of pleasure. She had felt herself so much wiser
than her husband. She had never wavered, not
for a moment, in her belief in him. He would
come out all right. If one understood him, there
was nothing to make one doubt. He was conscientious
and affectionate, and so much under her
influence. Her influence,&mdash;ah! She shuddered.
Only two months ago he had been at home with
her, and she had not seen any difference in him.
What wisdom, what intuitions! How fit she was
to guide and influence him! Oh, poor mother!
not only had her idol fallen in the dust, but she
herself had fallen with it. In all our abasements
that is generally the worst part.</p>

<p>The fire in the grate had burned out; the room
was cold. The house was still, with the early-dawn
stillness, when it is also the coldest. She
could not remember a vigil that had not been
because of illness. She thought of the nights&mdash;not

<!-- page 20 -->

many of them&mdash;when she had watched anxiously
by the beds of her children, and had seen
the dawn break. Ah! there are different trials
in life, "afflictions of all sizes." She wondered
if there were anything yet reserved for her that
would make this night's anguish pale, as this had
made those earlier ones. She could believe anything
of suffering, as she was living through this.
She paced up and down the room, and then went
out into the hall, now dark and still. Her heart
swelled as she thought of the little feet and merry
voices that she would never hear in it again.
She felt as if their family life were dead. She
could not imagine merriment ever again among
them. (She was a woman, and exaggerated.)
She went softly to the room where her two young
daughters slept, and, shading the candle she held
with one hand, gazed down at the fair, sleeping
faces. Honor had deserted her own pretty nest,
and crept into her sister's.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she murmured, "<i>they</i> are mine
still. I cannot lose <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>And the dry sirocco of the night's anguish was
relieved by a rush of tears. But at that moment
there came a sharp, pricking thought into her
mind. She started away from the bed where the
young girls slept, and went back to her own room.
Her tears were sent back to their source; there
was a tight feeling about her chest, a nervous energy
about her movements. "Never!" she said,

<!-- page 21 -->

between her teeth, as she pulled aside the curtain
and looked out at the dark sky where there were
still faint, cold stars. "Never!"</p>

<p>She was not thinking of the stars, nor watching
for the dawn. She mechanically dropped the curtain,
and walked again up and down the room.
Then shutting the door, and throwing a wrap
about her shoulders, she sat down by the dead fire,
and tried restlessly to rekindle it, as if some opposition
had taken the place of her abandoned
misery, and must find practical expression. She
entered into the details of the fire-making as if
there had not been anything else to think of; and
when her determination was rewarded by a faint
blaze and rustle, she leaned back in her low chair,
and gazed at the flicker, and repeated, "Never!"
with her hands firm set together.</p>

<p>Never what? The thought that had turned her
pain into such a changed channel, as she gazed
at the innocent loveliness of her children, was
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a mother who to-night cannot look
with such solace on her daughter's face. I am not
the only one who suffers. Which is the worse load
to bear,&mdash;hers or mine? <i>Can I help her?</i>"</p>

<p>Up to that moment she had not thought of the
mother. She had thought of the ruined, degraded
girl with repulsion, with angry, furious resentment.
She could not change that feeling now,
but thinking of the mother gave her a feverish

<!-- page 22 -->

anguish. She could not hide it from herself that
<i>she</i> was an object of just compassion. However
low her station, it was certain that she suffered.
In all stations of life, the sight of a daughter's
shame is counted the sharpest ignominy possible.
And these people were not low enough to be accustomed
to immorality. They were undoubtedly
far less sensitive, and missed much of the finer
pain of finer culture; but there were certain instincts
of nature which were not wanting in them.
This woman was suffering; then, innocently suffering,
perhaps, from her son's ill-doing. Could
any human power help her? Yes. There was but
one way; and there was but one person, perhaps,
who had the power, and she was that person. She
knew that if she set her face to have the reparation
made, in all probability it would be made. It
was then, with her heart as flint, that she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>She was not a person ignorant of, or indifferent
to, the world's judgment. There was a Judgment
she set far above it, and to which she looked with
an unusual fixedness; but she was human, and she
had not lived forty-two years among selfish men
and women without a little seeing with their eyes
and hearing with their ears. She knew that what
her son had done would be only a temporary injury
to his worldly prospects; she knew that in
her husband's eyes the worst feature of it was the
portent of his future recklessness. That might

<!-- page 23 -->

be tempered by the discipline of circumstances,
and sobered by maturer years. He might yet be
"as other men are." A little money would bridge
over the scandal. Outwardly everything might
yet be well. It did not pacify her heart at all.
He was "strange to her," this son she had borne.
But she had another side than the midnight, heart-revealing
one which we have been looking upon.
She had strong common sense, and a nice appreciation
of what was acceptable and profitable in life.
She had been successful in her small way. She
had found it so easy to succeed that she had not
valued her success very much. The strong religious
feeling which I have described had never been
brought into serious conflict with this easy, smooth
popularity-possibility in her nature. She had
had such a sweet, good, happy home she had been
satisfied, and had thought little about it. Duty
and pleasure had gone hand in hand. She had not
been obliged to define herself ambitious, because
she had had poured into her lap all she wanted,
and had never known what it was to be hungry.
Now, in her secret heart, she found she was ambitious,&mdash;not
for herself, but for her children. But
she found it out only when the pleasant fruits lying
in her lap were being snatched away.</p>

<p>She had imagination enough to know what a
galling, degrading yoke an ill-assorted marriage
is. To what depths would she sink her already
fallen boy, if she insisted on his making this

<!-- page 24 -->

reparation? Why should she set her judgment
against the judgment of the world; of all the
intelligent men and women who believed other
wise; of her husband, whose strong dissent she
felt sure of? Her judgment!&mdash;she had not much
reason to respect it at this crisis. No, she would
not listen to the faint but unceasing voice within
her. "<i>Never!</i>"</p>

<p>The fire was not much of a success. It flickered
and burned blue; it curled around the bars of the
grate, and spit out little gusts of smoke that made
a nasty odor in the room. She grew chill and
weary. She would go to bed. She got up and
began to undress herself. As she stood before her
dressing-glass, a sudden faintness came over her,&mdash;not
so much, if one could make the distinction, a
physical swoon as a mental one. She walked quite
steadily to the chair and sat down, and lay leaning
back in it, with her eyes closed. It seemed to her
the bed for which she was making ready was her
death-bed; that she was laying aside for the last
time the adornments and the habiliments of earth.
She should need nothing henceforth of the things
of time; she was leaving all behind that could
not be carried with her when she lay down in the
"wormy bed." She knew the parting with her
children had come; all her labor and planning for
them was done; all work was at an end; no more
now was permitted her to do, but what she had
done would be living on after her. With keen,

<!-- page 25 -->

awful sight she saw what had been well done, and
what amiss and with a low aim; for those few
strange moments everything stood out in the clear,
high, cold light of eternity. Little details of long-past
times, a decision about discouraging this companion
and encouraging that, the selection of this
school in preference to that, the giving up to certain
prejudices of others,&mdash;all came before her
with startling familiarity and yet more startling
newness. The gloss faded off some pleasures, a
new lustre grew on others. All seemed new, yet
old; awful, yet real. The worth of to-day's short
success against to-morrow's long retrospect,&mdash;the
balance, in fact, of time and eternity; the praise
of men, or the praise of God.</p>

<p>A half hour passed. A little more light came in
at the window. The steps of a servant going down
stairs shufflingly broke the stillness of the house.
Day was come, and the household was rousing
itself afresh. "The sleep and the forgetting"
were over for this night. The weary watcher shivered,
and lifted her head. Life had begun again
for her. The momentary faintness was a trick of
the nerves. Whatever you might call it, it had
done its work, and was gone. She knew very well
she was not going to die, but going to live, and to
suffer, and be tempted, as of old. Everything
seemed inexpressively commonplace and cheerless,&mdash;the
cold room, the dead fire, the gray light
creeping through the curtains, the yawning servants

<!-- page 26 -->

making their sleepy way down-stairs. She
had come back to life, but she had been to its very
brink; and a responsibility lay upon her not to
let slip from her memory what she had seen when
she stood there.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">WIDOW HOLDEN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> are not apt to feel very fresh and vivacious
after being awake all night, even if there has been
nothing to wear upon your nerves but the loss
of sleep. Most people are familiar with the uncompromising
character of such depression. It is
not only that your spirits are low, but your nerves
are strained; not only that to-day is a bore, but
the recollection of yesterday is hateful, and the
anticipation of to-morrow without attraction. If,
in addition to your vigil, you have had any mental
conflict to pass through, all that has changed
color with the daylight. Your tragedy has become
melodrama, your tears taste of brine, your
heart's blood looks very thin and poor; you feel
not only ashamed of your emotion, but out of temper
about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden found it very hard to meet the
requirements of this every-day day, which was yet
so unlike every day. It was raining dully. If it
had not been, she would have gone to the city,
or somehow got away from this insufferable yoke
of family life for a few hours. She had done all

<!-- page 28 -->

the thinking, feeling, resolving, of which she was
capable, and she had a sense of impatience at
the stagnation at which she had arrived, even
while there was a feeling of relief that there was
no more that she could do. No, there was nothing
more that she could do. She had made her
resolution in cold blood, and there was nothing
but to carry it out. The conflict with herself
had been the real, scorching trial; now there was
only the hard, practical business of keeping herself
to what she had promised.</p>

<p>She shut herself up in her dressing-room, and
sat down by the window, against which a slow,
persistent, chill rain was pattering. If the wind
had roared, if the trees had bent, if the sky had
been black with storm! But it was a commonplace,
raw November rain, chilling one like a
peevish, exacting, low-spirited woman in a house.
The few leaves were not swirled off in a gust, but
fell dispiritedly into the pools and rivulets that
had formed in the carriage-way before the door.
The vines hung despondently against the house:
they did not moan or sway; they only creaked
exasperatingly in the little peevish wind that occasionally
moved them slightly. The ground had
a soaked look, as if it had had enough of it; the
sky was even, monotonous, mediocre, grim. The
thermometer was not very low, but the dampness
was unspeakable. The stems of the trees looked
water-logged and unwholesome; from the twigs

<!-- page 29 -->

hung drops that the weak wind did not shake off.
There was little life or motion within sight from
the window. The house was too far from the road
to distinguish passers easily, and into the grounds
no one, at this hour and on such a day, would be
likely to come. The grocer and the butcher had
paid their morning visit. Mrs. Crittenden had
already gone through that penance. There was
nothing, there was nobody to come. She sat at
the window with the feeling of a person who
knows there is nothing to see, but who must gaze
on with the bitter idleness of grief. She could not
occupy her hands or her thoughts; her eyes roamed
over the dreary scene without, and were less pained
than when they rested on the ordinary and familiar
things within. Her door was fastened. There
was no danger of intrusion: the household orders
were given; Lucy and Honor would respect her
haggard looks. She leaned wearily against the
window and gazed out. The only feeling that
was not distinctly painful was that she would be
let alone, that nothing would be required of her,
that in a certain dead way she could rest. Suddenly
she saw an approaching vehicle turn in at
the gate. It was one of a shabby class of hacks
that waited about the depot, and sometimes
brought chance visitors from the train. Who
could be coming? She rose from her seat.</p>

<p>Before the cab was near enough for her to see
any one in it, she had made up her mind whom

<!-- page 30 -->

it contained. From the window she could see it
drive up to the door, and could see who alighted.</p>

<p>The visitor was a middle-aged woman, rather
slight, dressed in black, a little shabby. She wore
a close, old-womany bonnet, from which a limp
black veil hung, tied under the chin, in the fashion
of twenty years before. She got out, and in
a tremulous, wavering manner looked at the door
and then at the driver. At last she decided (if
that might be called a decision which seemed the
result of inability to see anything else to do) to
ring the bell, which was promptly answered.
Then she went back to the cabman, and took out
her purse to pay him. Her hands trembled very
much; she had difficulty in making the change,
or in understanding what his charge was. Her
gloves were rather loose, and a good deal creased
about the fingers. They were of foxy black, and
had probably been her best gloves for a number
of years. Because of their clumsy size, or perhaps
because she was not accustomed to wearing
them, she could not manage the small change;
some of it rolled upon the ground. The trim
maid came forward, and, smiling superciliously,
picked it up for her; the cabman smiled a little,
too, and looked at her curiously. At last it was
all settled, and the visitor followed the maid into
the house. In a moment more came a knock upon
her door. "A person, madam, asking for you."</p>

<p>Yes, she knew it. She was getting ready for

<!-- page 31 -->

the person; that is, all the evil in her was dressing
itself to appear, and she seemed to be turning
to ice and granite to go down to meet her. As she
went down the stairs she saw that the visitor had
been left in the hall, sitting on a chair near the
library door. The woman looked up, and rose
agitatedly.</p>

<p>Though the house was not a grand one, by any
means, it had a good staircase and a wide hall.
"Mamma looks like a lady in a story-book when
she comes down the stairs with a long dress on,"
Honor used to say.</p>

<p>"Will you not come in by the fire?" asked
Mrs. Crittenden, as she passed by her visitor, and,
entering the library, shut the door after them, and
gave her a chair.</p>

<p>"You won't be likely to know who I am," began
the stranger, in a voice which she could scarcely
control.</p>

<p>"I can imagine," said the other, looking at her
coldly.</p>

<p>"How? You know, then? You have heard?"</p>

<p>"I know you are probably from Malden. I have
not heard your name."</p>

<p>"It is Holden. <i>He</i> was of the Holdens of Greene
County, related to the Waterburys on the mother's
side. His folks are looked up to all about
our place."</p>

<p>And a faint flicker of pride was indicated in
her manner, washed out in the next instant by a
rush of recollection.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>"He?"</p>

<p>"My husband, I mean. He has been dead these
twenty years. I thought you knew about it, may
be. My girl never saw her father. She was born
six months after I buried him."</p>

<p>"I did not know anything about the&mdash;circumstances
of your life."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you know!" cried the poor
woman, unable to endure the slow torture of this
manner. "I have seen a great deal of trouble in
my life,&mdash;death and sickness, and hard enough
work to get along; and my own people are poor,&mdash;I
don't deny it,&mdash;and things ain't with us as
they used to be. But there's one thing I can say:
this sort of trouble, <i>this</i>, <i>this</i>, is new among us.
It's the first time that one of us couldn't hold
our heads up among decent people. I thought
I'd had trouble before, but&mdash;but"&mdash;</p>

<p>And the poor woman struggled with a handkerchief
that lay deep down in a low and very full
pocket, and when she got it out put it before her
eyes. This action brought out in high relief the
baggy gloves. I am sorry to say, none of these
details were lost on her hostess, who sat watching
her rigidly. The face that was revealed, when at
last the stranger took the handkerchief and the
gloves out of prominence, and essayed to speak,
was a sensitive, not unrefined one. It was quite
possible to fancy she had once been a pretty woman,
though hard work and the unjust burden of

<!-- page 33 -->

American lower-class life had aged her prematurely.
She was probably not very much older than the
more favored woman who was passing judgment on
her, but a careless observer would have said there
was at least a difference of fifteen years in their
ages. Her skin was dried and brown, a thousand
fine wrinkles networked it; her eyes looked tired
and old, and as if they had shed endless tears; her
mouth was sensitive and weak. She was timid, distrustful
of herself. One could not help seeing what
a fierce convulsion must have been needed to drive
her out of her homely seclusion to face cold and
unfriendly strangers. But Mrs. Crittenden did
not feel sorry for her. She hated her. I am sorry
to have to say this of the woman who kept her
boy's picture under the cross on her prayer-desk;
and who for forty-two amiable years had been the
admiration of her neighbors for her charity and
tenderness; and who, better than all, had made up
her mind to do right in this cruel matter. Perhaps
the last bit of evil was coming out of her
in this struggle; perhaps, if she had done this
blamelessly, she would have been too perfect to
be required to walk further among the thorns
and flints of this bewildering world. Perhaps&mdash;but
there is no use in speculation. She had turned
hard and cold, and, so far from pitying her adversary,
felt a sort of satisfaction in knowing that
she suffered.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;I've come to see you about this, but

<!-- page 34 -->

<i>she</i> doesn't know it. She wouldn't have let me
do it if she'd known."</p>

<p>"She?" interrogated Mrs. Crittenden, who refused
to recognize pronouns.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be, my daughter."</p>

<p>The lady shuddered. Ph&oelig;be,&mdash;that was a name
to bring into the family annals! Her only associations
with the name were, that it had belonged to
a greyhound of her brother's, and also to an old
mulatto cook, very stout and of much good-humor,
who used to give her doughnuts when she was a
child. Ph&oelig;be! Well, that was a very small matter.
She waited for her visitor to go on.</p>

<p>"She would have said it wouldn't do any good.
She would have kept me back."</p>

<p>"I think, if you'll excuse my saying so, she
would have been quite right about it."</p>

<p>The color flushed into the dried, brown cheeks.
"I didn't know you would be so hard to talk to,"
she said. "I thought, being a woman, and having
daughters of your own"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>my</i> daughters,&mdash;we will not talk of them,
if you please."</p>

<p>The thrust was not lost upon the stranger, and
the agitated color spread again over her face.</p>

<p>"You feel very safe about them"&mdash;she began.</p>

<p>"I said, we would not talk about them, if you
please."</p>

"No, I didn't come to talk about them. I don't
know how you've brought up your children, or

<!-- page 35 -->

whether it's your fault that other people suffer by
them. Girls are not so different from boys. Sin
is sin. And in our part of the country we don't
think our girls too fine to mention, and in the same
breath let our boys go free, when they've broke
the laws of God and man."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, in Malden, you are not very careful
in the education of your girls."</p>

<p>A passionate answer rose to the woman's lips,
but again the tide of recollection swept over her,
and made her silent.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," went on her tormentor, "that
you give them too much liberty, and do not teach
them to respect themselves. A woman's position
is very different from a man's."</p>

"We teach them out of the same Bible!" cried
the poor mother, trembling with the vehemence of
her feeling. "What's sin for one is sin for the
other. There ain't twenty commandments, one
set for one and one for the other, but only the ten
that's stood all these ages, and served for men and
women both. That's the way we read Scripture
in Malden."</p>

<p>"Malden is a small place," said her hostess,
coldly.</p>

<p>"If it is, it's a God-fearing place."</p>

<p>"Ah? Among the men, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, among men and women both, though
you do jeer at me for my girl's misfortune,"
groaned the stranger, turning away her head, and

<!-- page 36 -->

beating nervously with her gloved hands upon her
lap.</p>

<p>"Your girl's misfortune, and my boy's sin,&mdash;is
that the way they put it in Malden? With us&mdash;in
the world, I mean&mdash;it goes just the other way.
It's a misfortune, unlucky, you know. It's rather
a disadvantage to a young man, but nothing permanent.
It doesn't injure him in the eyes of the
world. He gets over it, he marries, he goes on as
if nothing had happened."</p>

<p>"He shan't!" cried the poor creature, rising in
her feebleness, and putting her hand out in her
impotent wrath. "He shall feel it. It shall hurt
him. My girl shan't be the only one to suffer."</p>

<p>"How will you manage it? You can hurt him
to the extent of a few dollars"&mdash;</p>

<p>"We don't want your dollars. You can keep
your dollars,&mdash;wicked, hard people that you are.
But we will have our revenge,&mdash;we will have our
revenge."</p>

<p>"How? Pray tell me how. Calm yourself.
We might as well talk this over quietly. It is
very bitter to both of us, no doubt. Such things
are trying to the temper and to the feelings.
Sit down again, if you please. There is nothing
gained by this sort of excitement, as you must
see."</p>

<p>She sat down, involuntarily obedient to her superior.</p>

<p>"When I tell you there is nothing that you can

<!-- page 37 -->

do beyond applying for some pecuniary salve, I tell
you the truth. The very pillars of society rest on
woman's purity. If there were any looseness permitted
about that, what would become of family
honor? It is hard that it should be so, but this
law is as old as society itself. We have to make
up our minds to take things as they are. Men are
permitted license that women cannot take. Society
has to protect itself, and that's the way it goes
to work to do it. Its laws are hard upon women
who sin,&mdash;very hard, I must admit."</p>

<p>"I don't care about the laws of society," moaned
the poor mother. "I care about what the Scripture
says. <i>You</i> know what the Scripture says
about&mdash;about"&mdash;</p>

<p>And she hung her head. It was new to think of
her girl as of one at whom the stones of the Jewish
mob might have been cast. She was just getting
acquainted with her grief, which was always
presenting fresh and unexpected phases.</p>

<p>"The world, you know, doesn't concern itself
about the rules of Scripture. This thing always
has been and always will be so. The world casts
out and degrades the woman who sins, and takes
back into favor her partner, and does the best for
him she can. I'm not saying it's right, but it's
so."</p>

<p>"God will punish him!" cried the woman.
"God won't let him go off free."</p>

"Ah! very likely not. There you may be right.

<!-- page 38 -->

And that's what you'll have to rest upon. For
<i>you</i> can't do anything about his punishment, believe
me."</p>

<p>"I'd better not have come. I thought&mdash;you
would be different. I didn't know you'd brought
him up that way. I don't wonder now,&mdash;I don't
wonder in the least."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, our children do not always
illustrate our teachings. I suppose your daughter,
now, was brought up according to the theories
you've mentioned?"</p>

<p>"She was brought up after a godly sort. Her
grandfather was a minister. Her father's folks
were all great hands for meeting. My people
weren't that kind, but I brought her up as I
knew he'd have wanted her to be brought up.
I did my best. I never let her stay home from
Sunday-school, rain or shine. She got a prize for
reading the Bible through three times in one year,
when she was only twelve years old. She knew
all the kings of Israel by heart, and there wasn't
a river or a mountain on any of the Scripture
maps that she couldn't put her finger on in half a
minute; and there wasn't a beetle or a bug of the
Holy Land that she couldn't tell you all about,
before she was turned of ten."</p>

<p>"Ah! And yet you see, hard as you tried,
her education has not been a practical success."</p>

<p>"Her education!" cried the poor woman. "Nobody
can say I didn't do everything I could for

<!-- page 39 -->

her. I've put up with being alone from Monday
morning to Friday night for the last four years,
while she's been away at Brixton at the high
school. I never let her do a stroke of work. I've
sewed for her, and washed for her, and mended
for her, and starved myself to pay her board and
schooling. And she did me credit,&mdash;yes, she did
me credit. She was the head of her class, and she
never lost a day all the four years at Brixton.
Her teacher in algebra said he'd never had such
a hand for the higher mathematics. And the
day of the exhibition she did a proposition on the
blackboard before them all. And everybody was
talking about her. No, no, there can't be any
thing thrown up against me about her education,
music and all. Heaven be thanked for that!"</p>

<p>If there had been anything needed to harden
Mrs. Crittenden's heart, it was this picture: a
pert, vulgar, higher-mathematical, over-educated,
under-bred country girl. The geography of Palestine
and the propositions on the blackboard obliterated
the last touch of pity.</p>

<p>"I think you would have done better," she said,
serenely, "to keep her at home with you, teaching
her to do housework, and be a modest, well-conducted
girl."</p>

<p>"I don't say but I should. I never felt that it
was right that I should be left to bring her up
alone, with nobody to look to. I was not the
kind to be left alone, to be at the head about

<!-- page 40 -->

things. Perhaps God knows what He took him
away for when we'd only been married inside of
a year; I could never see."</p>

<p>And she rocked herself backward and forward
for a few moments, while a bitter look came over
her recently tearful, pleading face.</p>

<p>"But you," she said at last,&mdash;"you had your
husband to help you. You had a plenty, and all
ways of bringing him up to choose from. Why
didn't <i>you</i> do better with your boy? You twit
me. But I'd like to know which has the most to
be ashamed of, you or me. I'd like to know how
we'd stand before the judgment of God. I don't
care about men. I don't care about their judgment
now. But I tell you, I'd rather be the
mother of my Ph&oelig;be, with all Malden pointing
their finger at her, than the mother of your bad,
black-hearted, fair-spoken son, that'll go scot-free,
and never be the worse for it, you say."</p>

<p>She panted; this flood of words was as unnatural
to her as the agony that brought it forth was
new.</p>

<p>"I don't see that there is much to choose, in the
matter of pride," said Mrs. Crittenden. "But that
is neither here nor there. I suppose we must bake
as we have brewed, and it seems we have neither
of us brewed very well. It doesn't help me that
you have an unworthy daughter, nor does it help
you that I have an unworthy son. I do not see
what can be gained by talking of it further."</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"There is nothing gained!" cried the woman,
starting to her feet. "I oughtn't to have come.
I&mdash;I&mdash;might have known&mdash;I'm a poor hand
to talk. Lawyer Brent would have come, but I
wouldn't let him. I was 'most wild. I thought
I could make you see what was right; but it
seems he'll have to come, after all."</p>

<p>She pulled her shawl about her throat, folded
her trembling hands over it, and went towards
the door.</p>

<p>"I would advise you, for your own sake, not to
send the lawyer," said the lady, steadily.</p>

<p>"I shall do what they tell me," she cried, opening
the door that led into the hall, "if I ever get
home to tell them about this. I didn't believe anybody
could be like you. I ought to have listened
to 'em. I&mdash;I&mdash;never will trouble you again."</p>

<p>"Stay," said Mrs. Crittenden, following her.
"I have something to say to you. Come back."</p>

<p>But the woman pushed on to the front door
and opened it, and would not look back, much less
come back, but with hurried, uncertain steps and
swaying figure crossed the shelter of the porch,
and passed out into the rain and mud. Mrs. Crittenden
called her, eagerly, loudly. The widow
shook her head, and did not look around, but
went wildly splashing through the pools that stood
in the road, as if she did not see them, and not
pulling her veil down to protect her face, as if she
did not feel the rain that fell upon it.</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>"Come back!"</p>

<p>It was easy to say Come back, but how to get
her to do it? If she ran across the lawn in her
slippers and morning dress, the household would
be roused, there would be a scene, everything
which she had planned would be destroyed. If
she sent a servant after her, she would perhaps
refuse to come, and certainly would say something
that would set the servants talking. No, there
was nothing for it but to let her go, uncomforted
by what in the end she had meant to tell her.</p>

Mrs. Crittenden doubted the woman's ability
to get away alone; she saw that, even as she
reached the road, she looked wildly up and down;
it seemed but a happy chance that she turned in
the direction of the depot. It would take twenty
minutes to order and get out the carriage, and
even then there was little hope of overtaking her.
If, however, Mrs. Crittenden did overtake her
there would be that said that the coachman ought
not to hear before she would consent to return.
If they met at the depot, all Marrowfat would
know the story before night. The woman's natural
shyness might keep her silent about her sorrow,
if no one spoke to her or questioned her.
But in her present over-wrought state, the sight
of her hard-hearted hostess would, without doubt,
open the flood gates again.</p>

<p>No, there was nothing to do but to shut the
door and go and warm herself, chilled to the marrow

<!-- page 43 -->

by the raw wind, and to trust that the unwelcome
guest would get safely away by the twelve
o'clock train, locking the secret in her breast.
She knew she had been cruel and cold; she felt
sharp compunction; but she had meant to be just,
and to convince her that whatever might be done
would be done of free grace and no compulsion
from outside. She certainly never meant to let her
go away without this tangible relief. She knew
that she scorned and hated her and her child, but
the knowledge that she meant to do right by
them as far as in her lay, even to the gross damage
of her own best beloved, took away the self-condemnation
that would have followed the hatred
in any other case. It all seemed a piece of her hideous
trial,&mdash;hideous, hideous, like a nightmare;
revolting, unlightened. She went up to her room,
and sat down in the window, and looked out again,
watching. May be the woman's strength would
fail her, and she would fall down, and they would
find from whence she had come, and would bring
her back. May be even now she was pouring her
incoherent tale into the ears of some crowd
gathered around her prostrate body. May be the
limp veil was even now being dried before the
fire of the first gossip of the town whose house
she had to pass on her way to the depot. It was
an unusual sight in Marrowfat,&mdash;a respectable
woman out in such a drenching, all-day rain, without
any protection but a limp veil and a thin black

<!-- page 44 -->

shawl. When, however, no news came, and the
distant whistle sounded at twelve o'clock, there
seemed a reasonable hope that the train bore away
with it the importunate widow and her ugly story.</p>

<p>"Mamma," cried Honor, "was that shabby
body a candidate for your Widow's Society? You
might have lent her an umbrella, if you didn't put
her on your list."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">JUST A WOMAN'S NOTION.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">That's</span> a woman's notion,&mdash;just a woman's
notion," said Mr. Crittenden, impatiently, pushing
back his chair and rising. This was the last, the
very last word of many spoken in the midnight
silence of a country house, when even the ticking
of the lowest-voiced clock was audible. The fire
had died down, having been replenished many
times while they talked. She was satisfied to have
it die down, for she knew her husband's gesture
was final, and that there was no more to say to-night. 
And she was not ill satisfied with the result
of this, the last of many long conferences. Though
he had not seemed to acquiesce in what she had
urged upon him any more at the end than at the
beginning, she felt that his objections were softening,
that he was harboring the plan, that he had
given it place, at least, in his consideration. She
knew very well that in this affair his convictions
had never been unalterable, while hers had been.
And indeed, our conquests are generally regulated
by the strength of our convictions. From
missionary work up, it is a matter of conviction,

<!-- page 46 -->

whether we succeed or not. The world belongs to
the brave, to the stout in his purpose, to the clear
in his seeing, to the undoubting of his path.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden was not very self-willed in domestic
interests. She did not have her own way
invariably. The laundry tubs were a standing
grievance to her. The new kitchen floor was
put in entirely in opposition to her judgment. In
many points about the education of the children,
she had silently surrendered her opinion to a husband
who was not tyrannical, but who had a
man's preference for the emanations of his own
brain. She was just enough to recognize his right
to do as he wanted to&mdash;sometimes. She bided
her time, and this was the time she had been biding,
evidently. For it needed all the memory of
her many concessions, as well as all the strength of
her strong convictions, to make him yield in this
most vital matter. He was a very fair modern
Christian, always on the side of right in public and
social matters. But when it came to such a step
as this, it appeared that his religion had been considerably
weakened by the current of worldly life
that had flowed so near it for so long a time.
The banks must have got washed down a good
deal in some places, in the course of fifty years
of such dangerous juxtaposition.</p>

<p>A woman's notion! What was just a woman's
notion, in this case? Briefly this: that this son
of theirs, who had sinned, should pay the penalty

<!-- page 47 -->

of his sin, and make reparation for it in the only
way possible to him; that he should save his unborn
innocent child from shame, and the woman,
who was at least no more guilty than he, from life-long
degradation.</p>

<p>"A pretty mess," he said, "society would be in,
if all were of your thinking. What sort of blood
would you get into our veins? What sort of
mixtures would you make in families?"</p>

<p>"That is not any concern of ours. Right is
right, if the heavens fall."</p>

<p>"You are putting a knife to the throat of the
boy; let me tell you that. You might as well kill
him as make him do this thing."</p>

<p>"I have considered all that."</p>

<p>"In a few years, if you don't force him into
this, he may steady down, marry well, and be a
credit to us."</p>

<p>"With that sin on his soul, and that child an
outcast? I don't want such credit."</p>

<p>"I have told you I will provide for the child."</p>

<p>"You cannot provide it a name and a place in
the world."</p>

<p>"That is fine talking. Its place in the world
would not have been very grand, with that low-bred
woman for a mother. I tell you I have the
poorest opinion of those people. You don't know
what you are about. You have let a sentimental
fancy run away with you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I have looked our duty in the

<!-- page 48 -->

face from the first, and it is bitter as gall to me.
I know every detail. I have counted what it will
cost us to the fraction of a penny, to the fraction
of a pang. I know that I am giving up the boy's
future as far as this world goes. I know that I
am injuring our daughters' prospects. I know
that I am damaging very seriously our material
prosperity; that I am putting a yoke upon us as a
family; that I am pulling all those dearest to me
down to a lower level in the eyes of the world.
But&mdash;I ask it, all the same. Edward, it must be
done. God knows I am not fanatic, I am not enthusiastic.
The happy and approved life we have
been leading has been as sweet to me as it has
been to you. I only knew how sweet when I saw
it being broken up. I like a high position. I like
the favor of the world. I have found out only now
how boundless my ambition has been for Barry,
where I have always put him in my thoughts. I
know if he makes this marriage he steps out of
notice,&mdash;he becomes the obscurest and most ordinary
person. I know that the girls will suffer
in a thousand ways from the loss of his popularity,
and from the difficulty that will be made in
receiving his wife. I know that our income will
be barely sufficient; that we shall be heavily burdened
for many years, perhaps, in the support of
his young family. I tell you frankly, I see no
bright side to it. It fills me with dismay. I wish
I could see any other way out of it, but, Edward,

<!-- page 49 -->

there is none. He must marry her; he must do
what is right. We must trust Heaven for the rest.
Suffering is better than sin. <i>This</i> is a heavy burden;
but what would be the burden of a wrong
unrighted, a debt uncanceled, all through our lives,
tainting everything? I don't want any such prosperity.
I don't want any child's cry, any woman's
moan, to haunt my sleep. Let us do right,
and bear what comes of it. Let us be brave about
it. Life is short. Why should we care so much?
If the thing is <i>right</i>, we've got to do it."</p>

<p>And so on through hours of midnight fireside
talk. Sometimes, I am afraid, her husband said,
Stuff and nonsense; sometimes, I am afraid, he
walked about the room with his hands driven deep
down in his pockets, and his forehead wrinkled
with the angriest opposition. But it was not in
the nature of things that such conviction should
fail to convict. "Only believe." The result was
certain, nor was the process very slow. Within a
week the following conditions were settled upon:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden was not to write to her son,
nor in any way influence him or communicate
with him. The father was to write him, more or
less sternly (more, probably), about the disgrace
and dishonor he had been to them, but putting
before him the choice between two courses. He
could, if he chose, marry the girl at once, remain
where he was for the winter, and in the spring
come home with her, in which case his father

<!-- page 50 -->

would take him into his office, allow him a salary
of two thousand dollars, and expect hard work of
him. He would give him as a home a small cottage
on the place, that had been hitherto occupied
by the gardener. He could promise him no
further assistance, and warned him that his life
would be of the hardest and humblest nature.</p>

<p>As an alternative, he could go at once, within a
week of receiving this letter, to China, to take an
inferior position in a large mercantile house with
which his father had influence, where he must at
least spend the rest of his youth, depending wholly
upon his own exertions, and having no allowance
from his father beyond his passage money and his
necessary outfit. The situation was secured, if he
chose to take it. The steamer sailed on the 20th;
a stateroom was at his disposal. The letter was
short and business-like, and was not calculated to
leave any doubt in the young man's mind that his
misconduct had ruined his prospects for life, and
that his father was not very much averse to seeing
him well out of the way.</p>

<p>Three days passed,&mdash;three days of very considerable
anxiety to the parents who waited for his
answer. China or Ph&oelig;be? The father thought
China; the mother believed Ph&oelig;be. The great
fear the mother had was lest he should be driven
by his pride to do something against his conscience,
and go away, stung by his father's curt
dismissal of him forever from the family life and

<!-- page 51 -->

by her silence. But she had promised not to
write, and could do nothing but keep her promise.
The father trusted that he would choose his freedom;
at all events, if he had a repugnance to the
woman, he had that door to escape by. A pretty
narrow door, to be sure, and none too inviting,
but he had it, and he could not complain.</p>

<p>At last an answer came, curter than the father's,
and as business-like. He elected Ph&oelig;be and
the two thousand dollars and the gardener's cottage
and humble pie generally. It was evident to
Mrs. Crittenden that they would never know from
him whether he turned his back upon freedom and
adventure because of his conscience or his pride,
his love of Ph&oelig;be, or his hatred of hard work. To
feed himself had not been Barry's idea of happiness
hitherto. He had been so lovingly fed, he had
never objected to the process. It now remained
to be seen whether his pride would interfere with
his digestion, or whether his laziness would uproot
his pride. His letter gave no evidence of a penitent
spirit. He desired an early remittance for
present expenses; he did not speak of his mother,
and sent no message to his sisters. He took the
attitude of an equal with his father; treated the
allowance as his right, and made the whole arrangement
strictly a business one.</p>

<p>It was part of the compact between the parents
that in writing to him henceforth his mother
should not allude to the matter otherwise than in

<!-- page 52 -->

its commonplace aspect; that she should bind no
burdens on his conscience, and let him know nothing
of the conflict that he had occasioned them.
This was in deference to the father's judgment
that she had always enervated him by her sympathy.
It was easy to agree to that, when she was
gaining so much more important things; but it
was not so easy to keep to it, when time passed
on, and each letter grew colder and shorter, and
the distance between them lengthened.</p>

<p>But she must bide her time. Spring would
come, and when they were once more face to face
the ice would melt.</p>

<p>When the letter came announcing his marriage,
the fact had to be communicated to his sisters.
The young girls held their elder brother in a sort
of idolatry. He was their hero; they had both
associated him very intimately, in their secret
hearts, with their own future. Lucy was prepared
to sacrifice herself to him, if he would accept her,
and to live unmarried to serve him and to further
in any way the great career which lay before him.
Honor, more worldly, dreamed of marrying him
to some one of great wealth and beauty. She felt
sure the lovely being would have a brother who
would be her own fate: they would wander together,
an ideal quartette, through lands of song
and picture, they would build houses side by side,
they would roll in wealth, they would exult in
all gifts of nature and of fortune. Poor Honor!

<!-- page 53 -->

it was a considerable downfall to have to hear
that her brother was already married to a young
woman living in a country village, whose name
was Ph&oelig;be, and who probably "did up" her own
collars and cuffs, if not the more bulky portion of
the family "wash." Honor was scarlet with shame
and disappointment, Lucy white with hurt feeling.
There were sore hearts in the house for many
days, but "young flesh heals quick." They had
been spared, wisely or unwisely, all but the fact
that he had married without telling his sisters
anything about it. They were at liberty to suppose
that everything but that was as it should be.
Lucy healed her heart's wound by reflecting that
such absorbed love as would permit him to forget
their existence must be heroic. She dedicated
herself henceforth to the care of his children, and
to the building up of the fortune which he had
forgotten, in his haste; to which practical end,
she discontinued two reviews and countermanded
an order for some books which she had felt very
necessary to her before this new necessity arose.
This gave her a sense of having risen to the occasion,
and&mdash;then things resumed their ordinary
course. Honor soon became interested in her
preparations for Christmas, and her enthusiasm for
her brother being cured, she reconstructed her
day-dreams, leaving him out, and was, all things
considered, as happy as before. It is always easy
to supply vacancies in day-dreams.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">WEARY-FOOT COMMON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> while the young girls thus happily accommodated
themselves to the change in the family,
their elders had more difficulty in reconciling themselves
to all that it involved. Mr. Crittenden was
not a rich man, in any solid sense. His professional
income was large, but so were his expenses.
He had felt that he had many years of good work
in him yet, and up to this time he had not taken
very heavily the anticipation of the future for his
family if those years should be denied him. Now,
however, anxiety took hold upon him: he acknowledged
that the easy years past had been unwise.
The provision for one family was inadequate, and
here was another laid upon him. He refused to believe
that Barry would ever do anything for himself.
Expenses that before had seemed necessary
and justifiable now fretted and galled him. He
grew nervous and irritable. The setting off two
thousand dollars for Barry's use, and giving up the
cottage to him were really inconsiderable sacrifices;
if he had been in his ordinary health and spirits
he would not have esteemed them heavy. But apprehension

<!-- page 55 -->

for the future took possession of him.
It was not unfounded apprehension; he should
have had it long before. They had spent too
much money. The proper provision had not been
made for the future; but that was not Barry's
fault, and should not have been laid at his door.
The fact was, it had appeared probable to both
father and mother that Barry would step into a
large fortune that was waiting for him in the hand
of a pretty young cousin, who had, with all the
rest of the world, seemed entirely devoted to him.
They had not talked about it even to each other,
nor schemed about it. They were not the sort of
people to do that. But in the secret heart of each
had been the conviction that after a few years of
liberty Barry would settle down to that, and be
among the rich men of his day without over-exertion
of brain or muscle. It changed things so
entirely to think of his needing as much or more
provision than his sisters. The burden grew in
tolerable. Men are much more irrational than
women when they get off their balance. They
seem unable to distinguish between necessary and
unnecessary expenses. Economy with Mr. Crittenden
became a hair-cloth shirt without grace. The
details of the family expenses stuck into him with
so many sharp points. Every bill presented
opened a chasm of ruin before them. His wife
was clear-sighted enough to know that the situation
was not very seriously changed except in their

<!-- page 56 -->

imaginations; she felt that the only good in it was
that they had come to see, before it was quite too
late, that they were living with unwise liberality.
It was hard that it should have happened just
when the girls were growing up. But what will
you? One is never ready for discipline. Like a
wise woman she fitted her neck to the yoke and
went on steadily, retrenching, soothing, smoothing,
enduring, but not enjoying the process more than
another.</p>

<p>It had been their intention to spend this winter
in the city, to give Honor the advantage of better
masters, and to let Lucy have her first glimpse
of the gay world. It had been talked of for
months, and all the arrangements made. Every
ten minutes one or the other of the young girls
said something about it in some way. Honor was
wearing her old walking-dress, and saving the new
one for the city. Lucy was assorting her music,
and deciding what books she wanted to take with
her; she was paying her last visits to her poor
people, and making out a list of what they would
need before she came back to them. It was one
of the steps on her new path of discipline that the
mother least enjoyed telling these happy young
planners that they would have to stay at home
and unmake their plans at their leisure. She
scarcely knew how to tell them; she put it off
from day to day, and fretted in secret over it.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Honor, tapping at her door on

<!-- page 57 -->

the afternoon of a day on which she had pledged
herself to tell them the bad news before night,&mdash;"mamma,
may I come in? My new habit has just
come by express. I put it on for you to see if I
don't look&mdash;very nice&mdash;in it."</p>

<p>And, pushing open the door, she stood on the
threshold, looking very pretty and very certain of
admiration, in a new riding-dress, the sight of
which smote the mother with dismay. In the pressure
of recent events, she had forgotten all about
this extravagance. A month or so ago, she had
taken Honor to be fitted for an expensive habit.
The bill; the uselessness of the dress now, since
there could be no saddle-horse bought, and no riding-lessons
taken; the child's disappointment; the
pride they had always felt in her graceful riding;
the unlikelihood of her now ever having that indulgence
again during her girlhood,&mdash;all mixed
themselves up bitterly in her thoughts, and she
turned sharply away from the sight of the slender
girl, who stood with one hand lifting up her skirt,
the other holding back the door. She looked
so confident of her mother's fond approval. Her
habit was perfect. She was high-bred looking,
with a slight figure, soft, blonde hair, <i>nez retrouss&eacute;</i>,
delicate coloring. It was the sort of figure and
face that belong to high civilization, that demand
wealth and costly surroundings, that seem out of
keeping with middle-class life. The riding habit
had cost enormously,&mdash;Mrs. Crittenden remembered,

<!-- page 58 -->

sharply, the very sum; but it seemed, even
now, as if it belonged to her of right, as if no one
would ever dream of ordering anything but the
best for that young aristocrat. Thrift, economy,
self-denial,&mdash;none of these fitted Honor. She
would be nothing if she had not her right setting,
everything if she had. She was a worldly little girl
and a self-willed little girl, but infinitely piquant
and winning. The mother knew of sincere depths
below the glittering surface, and had meant to
wait till this all melted in the sun of love. Now
she felt it would be crashed and broken by the
thwarting of circumstances, and she could not answer
for the consequences. She had meant Honor
to have a happy girlhood. It was easier to think of
Lucy suffering. Her face contracted with the pain
the thought gave her. She had a momentary feeling
of rebellion and anger. Honor started and
flushed as her mother turned sharply away.</p>

<p>"You don't care to see it?" she said, straightening
herself up, and retreating a step.</p>

<p>"No, I am busy. I cannot attend to you now."
She did not look up; the door closed. She knew
that for the first time in her life one of her children
had come to her for sympathy and had not
got it. She had shut out poor little Honor, and
sent her away wounded and angry. She did not
know herself. A great many such surprises await
us on our road, at a great many turns of which we
do not know ourselves. They prevent monotony

<!-- page 59 -->

for one thing, and promote humility for another.
It abases pride considerably to find that one's
cherished perfections are the result of circumstances,
of an absence of provocation to be imperfect.
What one thought an elevation of principle
was merely an elevation of income, forbearance
and charity, an unimpaired digestion, indifference
to the world, an abundance of its benefits.</p>

<p>The winter could not fail to be a trying one.
Though the young girls took their disappointment,
in the one case with sweet submission, in
the other with stormy but short-lived anger, and
though the family life moved on without much perceptible
change, all felt, in one way or another,
the darkening of that light that had always shone
from the mother's eyes, the break in the serenity
that had always made them serene. Indeed, to
her the strain at times seemed greater than she
could bear. The alienation from her son, the
changed future for her daughters, the effect of the
disappointment on her husband, were the great
things. The little, who can enumerate? Gloomy
weather; overstrained nerves reacting on digestion;
petty economies, that tried pride as well as love of
ease; curiosity of friends; annoyance at her husband's
depression, almost contempt for it; continual
vexation at the change in herself,&mdash;all these
things together made her days dark and painful.
There was nothing that she could do to appease
her restlessness. She could not pour out her love

<!-- page 60 -->

and solicitude in long letters to Barry, of whom
she could not help thinking night and day. She
could not even, with her hands, fit up and make
less miserable the poor little home for him, for till
spring it was in possession of the then-to-be-done-without
gardener. Her household ways were so
well ordered and of so long standing, she could not
employ herself much on their adjustment. She
was too restless to read with profit, too sad to visit,
too sore to bear any companionship. On what was
nearest her heart she could not speak to Lucy, for
she had kept her in ignorance of it; nor to her
husband, for they were not of one mind about it.
It certainly was none the better for her that she
had to keep it locked up in her own breast. She
began by longing for the spring "as they that watch
for the morning," and then to dread it, and to fail
in her convictions, and to doubt all things, beginning
with herself.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch06">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">HUMBLE PIE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a perfect afternoon in the latter part of
May. The garden and grounds had not yet begun
to show the absence of the deposed gardener,
for they had all been put in order by "days' work,"
and were yet trim from the process. The house
had been painted the year before, and was darkly
olive-green and deeply red where the vines did not
hide it. There was certainly no look of pinching
poverty about it. It was a charming home, built
upon the site of somebody else's perhaps less
charming home, and so, rich with old trees and
wealthy in vines and shrubs and hedges. The
grounds were three or four acres in extent. Other
well-appointed homes were near it, but you could
not quite look into their windows, and you could
not by any means talk from one piazza to another.
At the back, the ground sloped down into a sort
of ravine. On this slope lay the garden and the
stables, and an orchard that had been white and
pink with blossoms but a few days ago. Across
this ravine you looked over tree-tops to blue hills
that rose beyond. It was an old place and a

<!-- page 62 -->

new house, a very comfortable combination. The
house had been built some twenty years, but the
site was the old homestead of a well-known family,
which in his early married life Mr. Crittenden
had bought.</p>

<p>The old house itself had been torn down, but
the farmhouse, a very small and inconvenient one,
being of rather more recent date, was left standing,
and had served as a house for the gardener.
It stood at one side, quite up against the hedge
half-way between the road and the house, and
had been rather an eye-sore to Mrs. Crittenden.
It was not near enough to the road to be a gate
house, and was, besides, too far from the stables,
and too much under the nose of visitors and passers-by.
The gardeners' wives were apt to be careless 
about potato-parings and tin pans; their children
were sometimes untidy and noisy. It was a
standing offense to Barry, who had always wanted
it pulled down. But there it had stood, and there
it was to-day, the home to which he was bringing
his wife. Honor called it "Humble Pie," in a
whisper to her sister, which their mother heard
with a bitter smile. They did not know half how
humble.</p>

<p>The transforming of Humble Pie from a very
shabby Irish shanty into a picturesque cottage had
been the occupation of the spring. Very little
money was permitted, and very much labor was
required. It was a poor little place. The small

front door opened into a room which was to serve
for dining-room and parlor. It had three windows,
all of different sizes and in undesirable
places. A small kitchen adjoined it at one side.
A narrow staircase opposite the front door led up
from the parlor to the two sleeping-rooms above.
These rooms were under the roof, and the ceilings
slanted very much, and the windows were small,
and the closets could never be anything but musty.
There was a loft over the kitchen, which was to be
the dormitory of the one servant, though it had up
to this time been the dormitory of the rats and the
receptacle of old garden tools and obsolete pots
and pans. One of the two bedrooms was fitted up
for Barry's dressing-room. Dressing-room! The
window was so low, there was not a spot where he
could get light enough to shave without going on
his knees, or sitting on the floor. There was no
place where the press for his clothes could stand
save directly behind the door, which consequently
would open only a few inches, and which would
make it necessary to squeeze in with great compression
of the person. One can squeeze in through
a door once, but for a "constancy," as they say
in the country! It was hard to fancy Barry keeping
his temper through this daily ordeal,&mdash;Barry,
the most exacting member of a dainty, luxurious,
smoothly running household. The architect of
this ancient building had not been an advanced
ventilationist. There was no accredited way in

<!-- page 64 -->

which the air could get into the sleeping-room,
or, having got in, get out. The window was not
opposite the door, but modestly behind it; and it
could be raised only a matter of five inches, and a
dense growth of evergreens shut it up from without.
The little lobby had no perceptible mode of
ventilation save from below, and as the stair-door
opened into the parlor, and was not ornamental
when open, it was safe to say it would generally
be shut. "They will both have typhus fever and
die," said the mother. The father refused even to
go into the house and look at it.</p>

<p>"He has made his bed, and he will have to lie
in it," he said. "If he wants a better house, let
him bestir himself and go to work and get it."</p>

<p>But pretty paper and muslin curtains and a
little fresh paint made it quite a delight to the
young sisters, who did not care much about ventilation
as a principle. The vines outside, and a
very inexpensive new porch, and some hoods over
the "unthinking" windows, and a coat of paint
certainly rendered it not unattractive. Lucy and
Honor, with step-ladders and tacks and hammers
and spoils from their own rooms had flitted in and
out, as happy as nest-building birds. The mother,
with anxious eyes, had superintended the "pointing
up" of chimneys, the putting in of kitchen
shelves, the clearing out of drains. The garrets
at home had been ransacked, the upper shelves of
china closets overhauled: scarcely anything new

<!-- page 65 -->

was bought, and yet Humble Pie was comfortably
furnished and a not unpleasant-looking little
place.</p>

<p>What could be unpleasant looking, in this
warm, sweet, late May weather? Fresh shoots
from the vines hung about the porch and windows;
the thick screen of evergreens had renewed itself,
and was bright to match the season. Not a weed
had presumed to obtrude itself on the freshly
made path, and the new sod that had been laid
to obliterate the gardener's children's foot-prints
had become naturalized, and was green and bright.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when they arrived, Barry and
his wife alone (for the little baby, for whose good
name so much had been sacrificed, had died before
it saw the light, and had had no need of a
name, good or bad, in this or perhaps any other
world). His mother had sent away the two young
girls, when she heard the whistle of the train
sound. The journey had been long, and they
would be tired. The meeting would be agitating.
It was well the travelers should rest, and see their
home by themselves, and come over at seven
o'clock to dinner. The mother alone would stay
to meet them and give them a word of welcome,
and then leave them to the lunch already prepared,
and to the inspection of the house, that could not
fail to have as much interest to them as to those
who had with so much affection made it ready for
them. The new servant in the kitchen was nervously

<!-- page 66 -->

moving about and glancing out of the window.</p>

<p>Yes, in five minutes they would be here; in
five minutes would come the minute of which
the mother had been thinking for, let us say, a
hundred thousand minutes, since that November
new moon shone through the library window over
the left shoulder of pretty, pettish little Honor.
She should in five minutes see again her alienated
boy,&mdash;see the face she had never left off seeing day
or night since then, and see the dreaded, despised,
and all unknown woman who had taken him away
from her. Her breath came short and quick: it
makes great draughts upon one's strength to rehearse
so often the moment which is so slow in
coming. How would it be? Would she be strong
enough to conceal any repulsion that she might
feel towards her? Would she be self-controlled
enough to show just the right tenderness to him,
not overwhelming him with that for which perhaps
he had ceased to care, and not chilling him
by a change from the welcome to which he had
been accustomed? One needs to be saint, statesman,
one needs to be filled with wisdom, human
and divine, to be a parent.</p>

<p>She looked again about the little room. It was
all in order: flowers in the pretty vases, dainty
china for their first meal on the small square
table, pictures and books and ornaments disguising
the plainness and poverty of the place. The

<!-- page 67 -->

sunshine came in through the fluttering green
shadows of the vines outside; the soft muslin curtains
moved faintly with the summer breeze;
there was verbena among the roses and mignonette
on the table, and the odor was delicious.
Honor had brought down one of her canaries,
among her other welcoming gifts, and it hung in
the porch and sang its best to the admiring robins
and bluebirds in the trees overhead. But ah,
what a home to which to welcome her boy! It
was a cruel travesty of all her ambitions for him.
The first-born of the house, the admired young
Adonis, the planned-for, speculated-about, carefully
educated, exceptionally gifted son, coming home
with his bride to the gardener's tumble-down
shanty, on the outskirts of his father's not too ample
grounds! It all seemed a miserable burlesque.
Had they been thinking themselves of too much
consequence for the past twenty years, and was
this the waking up? Was this the fit beginning
for the son they had reared, or was it fit only for
him because he had failed to profit by their rearing?
There are times in our lives when confusion
of the elements makes it impossible to take our
reckoning, and this was one of those times. The
only thing she could hold by was the certainty
that when she had made the decision she had
done what she thought right, and by that inward
compass she must steer and wait the chances, or
the providences, or whatever they were.</p>

<!-- page 68 -->

She felt too overstrained to meet the new-comers
now; she wished she might put it off.
She walked about the room, her cheeks flushed,
her lips firm-set. She was a small woman; in youth
she had been very slight, but the after-forty fullness
was now rounding her figure, and making
her less girlish, but not ungraceful. Her hair was
light and waving; her eyes were gray and fine
and expressive and rather far apart; her nose
<i>retrouss&eacute;;</i> her mouth not small, firm and yet
sweet. Her motions were quick, but her manner
composed. She gave you the idea of being
younger than she was. Her voice was very sweet,
and she had a manner of attention and sympathy
which made her much beloved. Withal she seemed
to be judging, weighing, even in little things, and
yet she was not cold; she was even impulsive,
when she approved her impulses. People thought
she probably hadn't any impulses which were not
to be approved. She was very much looked up to,
and for years had known that her opinion was of
weight with the persons among whom she moved.
Now all this seemed part of the huge mistake in
which her life was engulfed.</p>

<p>There they were; she heard wheels at the gate,&mdash;the
wheels of one of the shabby hacks. For
their carriage was put down, and Honor's pony
sold, and the shabby hacks at the depot were all
their reliance now. How would Barry relish bringing
his bride home in one of them,&mdash;home to the
gardener's humble shanty?</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>As the hack drew up before the little door she
went back a moment more to collect herself. She
caught sight of Barry as he stepped out of the vehicle;
she saw him glance quickly and curiously
up at the front of the little house, with a contraction
of the brow. How tall he looked, how broad-shouldered
and handsome. It was more incongruous
than ever to think of him under this low
shelter. Then she came forward and stepped
upon the porch to meet him: his companion was
standing behind him. Barry approached her, and
stooped down and kissed her. She did not even
meet his eye, in her agitation. She saw that his
cheek was a little flushed, and that his hand trembled
slightly, that was all that she could be definite
about, when, in her own room, she thought
the meeting over. She had carried away no impression
of the young wife, save that of a tall,
well-formed woman, wearing a dark traveling
dress and having a veil tied over her face. Nothing
had been said, save the acceptance of her explanations
and arrangements. She had left them
almost the moment after their arrival, and now
there was nothing to do but await the hour of
dinner, and the beginning of the new life that
must be so full of consequences to them all.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE NEW DAUGHTER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening was warm, even though it was
still May, and at seven o'clock it was much more
attractive out of doors than in. The sky was full
of lovely tints, scarcely yet to be called sunset
ones, and the air sweet with the thousand odors
of late springtime. There was a honeysuckle on
the piazza that had put out its first faint blossom;
and it was a faith of Lucy's that the green leaves
of all the vines gave out a perfume during the
first few weeks of their innocent lives. The piazza
was hung with twenty years' growth of vines:
Marrowfat was a warm place, and all summer the
family lived as much outside as inside the house.
There were one or two tables and plenty of bamboo
chairs and lounges on the wide piazza, and
brackets and shelves, and generally an afghan or
two and some footstools, and a leather screen.
When a shower came, there was a rush for the
piazza to secure the properties; but the thick
vines made it a tolerably safe place even in a
shower. This evening all the windows were wide
open, back and front; the sunset was at the rear,

<!-- page 71 -->

and shone through, and made house and piazza
light and warm-colored. Lucy sat with a book
on her lap, but it need not be said she did not
read. Honor wandered about restlessly; now going
into the parlor to glance at her pretty little
person in the mirror, now coming out on the
piazza and peering through the vines, to see if
they were coming.</p>

<p>"If papa had only got back in the early train,"
she said for not the first time. "It would have
been so much nicer for him to have been here to
receive them. But he acts exactly as if he didn't
care a straw about their coming. I almost think
he had forgotten it."</p>

<p>Certainly it would have been nicer. It was one
of the small contrarieties that darkened his wife's
life nowadays that he had not come in his usual
train. She only hoped it was not with a purpose.
She was a woman who made her little plans and
rehearsed her little scenes with a strength of imagination
that made their disarrangement a very
vital matter. She had hoped they would all be
together at the steps to welcome Barry when he
first came up them with his new wife. She had
thought the father's coldness would be covered by
the general movement and distraction. Now the
meeting was to be done all by itself, and no one
would fail to see just how unwelcome both son and
daughter were to him.</p>

<p>"Here they come," whispered Honor, flitting

<!-- page 72 -->

out from behind the vines. Lucy closed her book
with a throb of the heart, and rose. The mother,
quite pale, but with a sweet welcoming smile came
forward to meet them. They were crossing the
lawn, Barry a little in advance, as if he were
not thinking of his companion, but were nerving
himself for something, which he proposed to get
through with as quickly as might be. He was
well, even elegantly dressed; with maternal omniscience
the mother knew that his clothes must be of
last year, for he had had no money to get new ones
since. There was something about him so above
this sort of mean fact. He was commandingly well
made; he carried himself with an innocent pomp,
an absence of disdain combined with a conviction
of supremacy. He was so strikingly handsome
that people turned and looked at him, both men
and women. It had always been, "your handsome
son," "that splendid boy of yours," ever
since he wore petticoats. Who could look at him
without pride, that had any part in him? His
skin was not dark, rather clear, and with a redness
that came and went, but was not in the least effeminate,
any more than the smile which was continually
glimmering across his face, and which seldom
went entirely out. (It was out now, though,
out utterly.) His hair, which had a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of
a wave, was of a bright, lively chestnut, as was
his mustache. It was abundant, rich, thickly
growing hair, which asserted itself, though kept

<!-- page 73 -->

shortly cropped. Indeed, there, was no suggestion
of want of abundance about him: the pity was all
the greater that it should exist in his pocket. His
eyes were gray, large, and expressive, and with a
sort of flame about their glance that one does not
look for in gray eyes. They had very dark and
long lashes, a part of the amplitude of his tonsorial
endowment. The ready-coming color and the
long lashes would have risked the manly appearance
of another, perhaps, but Barry was too tall
and too self-asserting and his manliness too pronounced
to be endangered by such trifles.</p>

<p>At this moment he was pale rather than
flushed, however, and the seriousness, almost constraint,
of his face struck his young sisters as unnatural.
The gravity of the occasion began to
oppress Honor uncomfortably; she scarcely dared
to look at her new sister. Did people always feel
like this when they had been getting married?
Barry stooped and kissed his mother, who came
half-way down the steps to meet him.</p>

<p>"And Ph&oelig;be?" she said, with a tender smile,
going down another step and putting her hands
out to the young woman, who was still standing
on the ground at the foot of them. This position
brought her a little above the level of the head of
the new-comer, who was as unusually tall as she
was unusually short. She kissed her almost on an
equality, and then, keeping her hand, led her up
the steps towards the two girls who, having hurriedly

<!-- page 74 -->

greeted their brother, stood shyly awaiting
her. Ph&oelig;be tripped slightly on the middle step.</p>

<p>"Oh why did you trip!" cried Honor, involuntarily.
"It's bad luck."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope not," murmured Ph&oelig;be, almost
inaudibly.</p>

<p>"These are your new sisters," said Mrs. Crittenden.
"And this one, I needn't say, is the superstitious
one. You must try and cure her."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not look as if she had a mission to
cure any one of anything: she looked as if she had
all she could do to get through the ordeal and
cure herself of the desire to run away, though she
did not impress her young sisters with anything
but an appearance of stiffness and reserve. They
kissed her and led her to a seat on the piazza, and
sat down beside her, and covertly looked at her
while they talked to her.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was a person you could not well help
looking at any more than at Barry, for, like him,
she was notably handsome, though without the
finish of good dressing and easy bearing. Not that
her bearing would not have been easy on her native
hills, or among her own people; but it takes
a pretty stout easiness of bearing to stand up
against the first meeting with your husband's relations,
particularly when they look at you covertly
when they talk to you, and have reason to.</p>

<p>She was, as has been said, very tall, and rather
fuller and finer than it is the fashion to be nowadays.

<!-- page 75 -->

But she was quite capable of making a fashion
for herself. She was a beauty. Her shoulders
were well shaped, her head well set upon them.
Though she wore an abominable shiny black silk
dress, which fitted with home-made smoothness
and total want of style, you could see there was
no fault to be found with her figure. You had
faith in the perfection of the arms you did not
see, thanks to the odious, ill-made sleeves, and to
the purity and roundness of the throat that had
a stiff linen collar close about it, fastened with a
big brooch, which had a good many quirls and
turns of chased, cheap-looking gold. She was
large, if that is any objection, but large correctly,
in proportions that satisfied you. You
knew that she would move well, with a certain
full grace, when she was at ease, and not being
looked at by her husband's relations. Her skin
was clear, and her cheeks and lips had a warm
color. Her rich brown hair grew low on her forehead
and waved without assistance. It was as
badly arranged as might be, for the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> style
had not reached Malden, and the maidens and
matrons of that neighborhood still wore fortresses
of hair on the tops of their heads. It was easy to
see, however, that Ph&oelig;be had, so much that she
could, when enlightened, dress it in any style demanded.
Her nose was straight, and her mouth,
while not fuller than everything else about her,
was certainly not indicative of undue sternness of

<!-- page 76 -->

purpose or a lack of physical life. But it was
sweet and well formed; the indentation of the
upper lip was deep, and her slow, infrequent smile
brought out a look of innocence. Her eyes were
large, and brown, and soft. They were appealing
and affectionate, like the eyes of a setter dog.
She was evidently rather a silent person, whether
from shyness, or from a natural disinclination or
inability to communicate with her fellow beings, it
was not easy at once to see. While Barry was
standing by his mother near the steps, and the
others were sitting down a short way from them,
a hack drove in at the gate.</p>

<p>"It is your father," said Mrs. Crittenden, a little
nervously, looking at her watch. Barry, perhaps
from nervousness as well, moved away from the
steps and joined his sisters.</p>

<p>"Papa is late," remarked Lucy.</p>

<p>"Why does he come in that old thing?" asked
Barry.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know," cried Honor, "that
we've given up the carriage?"</p>

<p>"What for? In consequence of your getting
to be a young lady?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; more in consequence of your getting
to be a married man! Don't you know
economy is the order of the day?"</p>

<p>"A very disagreeable order," muttered her
brother, the color coming into his face. It had
not receded, nor his brow smoothed, before the

<!-- page 77 -->

hack stopped at the steps and was battered open
by Mr. Crittenden from within, who emerged,
tired and rather pale. He did not look at once
up to the piazza, but turned and gave the man
some directions, and then opened the dilapidated
carriage door again, and searched about for something
he had left. If Mrs. Crittenden had not
engaged with herself at an early age not to pull
the wires of her male puppets, she would have
said, "Barry, go down and meet your father and
take his bag."</p>

<p>She trembled with the eagerness that she felt
to say it; but she was a wise woman, and forbore.
Barry did not go; very likely would not have gone
if he had been asked. He stood with a contracted
brow, looking across the. lawn till his father came
up the steps.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" asked the latter, after speaking
to his wife, reaching out his hand to him in
a matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be," Barry said, stepping back, after he
had dropped the perfunctory hand, "this is my
father."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Crittenden, looking towards
the group, from which Ph&oelig;be made an uncertain
slow step forward. "This is your wife? How
do you do?"</p>

<p>And he put out his hand. It seems probable
that during a critical instant he debated with himself
whether to kiss her or not. If that were so,

<!-- page 78 -->

he decided in the negative, and let go the hand
he held without any further advance or welcome.
The girl became slowly very white, and drew
back to her place behind the two young daughters,
who in their turn were greeted without effusion by
their father, and kissed him lightly. Lucy ran
forward and took his bag, and, as usual, went up
with him to the door of his dressing-room.</p>

<p>Dinner was a little stiff; it could not have been
otherwise. But Honor's vivacity was unfailing.
She liked events, and this was an event of magnitude.
She was too young to read between the
lines of her elders' forced talk, and not imaginative
in the way that Lucy was, who was making
a volume of romance out of every change of color
in the young stranger's face. She simply found it
delightful to have had a marriage in the family,
and it was a treat to see a bride, even if one of
six months' standing, and such a very odd one. It
was a break in the monotony of the home life.
For the winter had been dull, and the spring had
been worse, and summer was not yet on its feet.
At sixteen one likes things to happen. Honor
was watching always for something to happen.
This taste of hers was quite a boon to the family
on that evening, as one person in very sincere
good spirits must be to a tableful of doubtful or
depressed ones. Before the meal was over, life
looked a little more possible to one or two of the
party, and a little more promising to one or two

<!-- page 79 -->

others. Honor's lively chatter brought again before
Barry's eyes the old life, and recalled his interest
in trifles long forgotten. A good dinner
warmed his blood; it was something to bask again
in the sunshine of civilization. Lucy always consented
to be happy if others would be so. The
mother felt the long strain on her heart relax a
little. The father, unconsciously to himself, was
relieved that the first step was taken, and promised
himself that the succeeding ones should not affect
him equally. The tie of blood was imperceptibly
asserting its magic force. The young alien felt
them drawing together, and knew herself an alien.
When they were leaving the dinner table,&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all," said Honor, "it's very generous in
me to be glad to have Ph&oelig;be here, for she's not
becoming to me. Don't you see? She makes me
look little, and thin, and poor. Lucy does better
beside her,&mdash;she's taller than I am, and isn't put
out completely: she makes rather a nice contrast,
with her light hair. But I,&mdash;I'm blown out;
there isn't a flicker left. Ph&oelig;be looks like a
great Jacqueminot rose, and I like a piece of white
clover, a little browned at the edges."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have called you a field flower, exactly,"
remarked her brother, touching the scarf
of her delicately embroidered French cashmere.
"This looks more like Solomon in all his glory."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's nice?" asked Honor,
drawing back a step and looking over her shoulder

<!-- page 80 -->

with a complacent vanity. "It's a French dress
mamma ordered for me last fall; and it didn't
get here till Christmas. It was to have been my
nice dress all winter, but as we didn't go to town
it will do for my nice dress all the spring and
fall. Don't you see? I'm getting very thrifty.
I haven't worn it once. I wouldn't waste it on
Marrowfat in the winter. But this was such a
great occasion."</p>

<p>"We feel it," said Barry, briefly. He could
have wished she wouldn't talk about the family
economies so much. They went back to the
piazza for a while, as the evening was so warm.
The sky was still bright with the sunset tints.
Lucy went down the steps and picked some flowers,
which she gave to Ph&oelig;be, who held them as if
she didn't know what to do with them.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like flowers, I'm afraid," thought
Lucy, with a sinking of the heart. What did
she like? Evidently not clear soup and lobster
p&acirc;t&eacute;s and salads and meringues, for she had left
them successively almost untasted on her plate,
and wouldn't have taken them at all except for
a look from Barry. She did not appear to like
pretty rooms and wide piazzas, for she did not look
at them with any interest. And it was to be
doubted whether she liked her new relations very
much, for she was very irresponsive to all their
graceful advances.</p>

<p>And how did they like her? The mother

<!-- page 81 -->

looked at her affectionate, dumb-pleading eyes,
and forgave her, and almost loved her. The father
took in at a glance her unusual beauty, and
his heart hardened towards her, and softened towards
the son who had been led away by it.
Certainly there was excuse for Barry. We don't
love the splendid horse that has thrown and killed
some one dear to us, nor the fine dog who mangled
our pet, nor the keen blade that made such
a quick end of our friend. Their individual perfections
do not render the sight of them any less
painful to us; rather, more.</p>

<p>Lucy watched covertly the constrained, undemonstrative
manners of the new-comer, her passive
grasp of the nosegay that she gave her, her
unsuggestive answers, the little interchange of
glance and word between her and Barry; and
Lucy was perplexed and somewhat downcast,&mdash;poor
Lucy, with her dreams and her small experience.</p>

<p>And Honor looked at the ill-made black silk
and the flamboyant breast-pin, and wondered,&mdash;wondered
till she almost forgot to talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Crittenden had wandered away to look at
the garden, after dinner; his wife had hoped Barry
would go with him, but he showed no such intention.
So they all sat on the piazza watching the
fading sky, and drank their coffee when it was
brought out to them. There were many things to
tell Barry. He would not ask questions, but it

<!-- page 82 -->

was plain he was interested in this and that, and
Honor had a sprightly way of imparting gossip
that her brother had always rather approved.</p>

<p>"And Tartar's coming to-morrow. Did you
know that?"</p>

<p>"My cousin Tartar! You don't tell me so!"
cried Barry, getting up and walking across the
piazza with his hands in his pockets, evidently
much interested. "It's&mdash;a great many months
since I've heard a word of Tartar. How is she
getting on? Is she engaged or anything?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, Barry," said his mother, with a soft
sigh. "Tartar isn't engaged. You know you
didn't expect to hear that."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I don't know why not. I didn't
'expect' anything about it, if I must tell the
truth."</p>

<p>"Tartar is a dear girl," she said, in the same
tone. "I shall be glad to see her again."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you won't be gladder than I."</p>

<p>Barry stood leaning against a pillar of the
piazza before them in an easy, graceful attitude,
his face quite lighted up with interest in these
things, all new to Ph&oelig;be. Though she had never
heard Tartar's name before, she knew the whole
story in a moment, the mother's soft sigh, his sudden
awakening. She had vaguely known that
there was some one who had been intended for
him. It was this cousin, then, that they had meant
him to marry,&mdash;this cousin who was coming to-morrow.</p>

<!-- page 83 -->

<p>"You know she's been ill. We haven't seen
her since before the holidays," said Honor. "She
went South early in January. Everybody was
frightened about her. She had pneumonia, and
it left her with such an ugly cough."</p>

<p>"I hadn't heard of it," said Barry, dryly. It
seemed his interest did not abate, though he did
not ask Honor to go on.</p>

<p>"We went to town to see her just before she
sailed. She was so thin, her hand seemed like
nothing, only it was so hot. And she talked,
talked, every minute we were there. Lucy and I
simply didn't say a word."</p>

<p>"Tartar never was what you'd call reticent,"
Barry said, with a little laugh, bending over his
cigar, in which he was cutting with a very sharp
knife a very small incision.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, Barry?" asked Lucy, with
a hurt expression.</p>

<p>"Would you have me cry? I take it she's
better, since she's come back from the South and
is expected here to-morrow."</p>

<p>"She is better, but she was very ill. You ought
to be ashamed for making light of it, when you
and she were such friends," said Honor.</p>

<p>"I'm showing my feeling by being glad that
she's well, not by being sorry that she wasn't."</p>

<p>"Ah, much feeling you show!" cried Honor.
He certainly did not look much moved. Ph&oelig;be
knew it was passing through his mind that in December

the news of his marriage had been made
public. She tried to think whether it would please
her to hear that any man had been made ill by the
news that she was married (always provided of
course that he had got well again before she heard
he had been ill). It hardly seemed to her it would
have given her much pleasure; but she could not
tell,&mdash;it might. And then one must make allowance
for a man: men are so different from women
about such things.</p>

<p>"Her Aunt David went with her, as usual,
though she had to be carried on the steamer, stiff
with rheumatism. But she was so frightened
about Tartar's cough she wouldn't let her go
without her, and now she won't let her out of her
sight. She's coming up with her to-morrow. I'm
afraid Tartar'll never have her liberty again."</p>

<p>"There might be worse things than having
Aunt David as a permanent attachment. And
have they got an apartment? Where are they
living?"</p>

<p>"At a hotel. They feel that Tartar won't be
able to spend her winters at the North any more,
and so they have given up their apartment, and
are floating population."</p>

<p>"Talk about liberty! There's liberty for a
young woman: the world before her, and nobody
in it belonging to her but one old woman, who
does just as she tells her to; and more money than
she knows what to do with. If she can't be happy,
who can?"</p>

<!-- page 85 -->

<p>"You forget," said Lucy, "that liberty isn't
all women want."</p>

<p>"They generally think it's that they want as
soon as they have got husbands."</p>

<p>"And Peyton Edwards is coming up, too, to-morrow.
I thought you'd be glad to see him,"
added Mrs. Crittenden. "It's so long since he's
been here, I feared he had forgotten us; but last
week I got a note from him, from which I inferred
he would be glad to come. So I wrote him that
you would be home, and he must come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"He waited till the mud was dried up," cried
Honor, with fine scorn. "Barry, nobody's been
here all winter,&mdash;literally nobody. I shall know
now who are to be counted on."</p>

<p>"That's unreasonable, Honor," said Lucy, earnestly.
"There was nothing going on; we didn't
ask anybody. You couldn't expect to have
young men coming here in winter, when Barry
wasn't home, without being asked."</p>

<p>"You'll see; they won't wait to be asked now
it's pleasant weather; they'll remind us of their
existence, as Peyton did."</p>

<p>"Poor old Peyton," exclaimed Barry, with a
laugh; "he's the last person you'd accuse of being
a fair-weather friend."</p>

<p>"Or of angling for an invitation," said his
mother, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Poor old Peyton, indeed! He's about two

<!-- page 86 -->

years older than you are, Barry. He may be poor,
but he won't be long, the way he works and the
way he doesn't waste his money! He's the kind
that everybody calls reliable, steady-going, and that
sort of thing; but for all that, I say he isn't any
better friend than any of the others. You know
yourself, mamma, you've wondered that he hasn't
come all winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that will be explained some time, my
child. Trust your friends."</p>

<p>"If you've got any to trust! Barry, did you
write to him and tell him about&mdash;about your
getting married?" asked Honor.</p>

<p>"No," said her brother, shortly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's that. You ought to have written
to him, the most intimate friend you've got."</p>

<p>It became more and more apparent that a young
and enthusiastic person, who has not been told all
the truth, is a very uncomfortable member of a
divided family circle.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">TARTAR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night, when Ph&oelig;be went up to her room,
she walked thoughtfully to her glass and looked
in it.</p>

<p>"Why didn't he tell me they didn't wear
pins?" she said to herself, pulling out the great
gold brooch and thrusting it out of sight in an
open drawer. There was something in the gesture
that showed vehemence of feeling,&mdash;vehemence,
but not haste, as if the fire had been kindled some
time ago, and had just now ripened into a steady
blaze. Now that her new relations were not looking
at her, Ph&oelig;be moved without constraint, and
with a sort of concentrated purpose. She took off
the black silk, which she had learned to hate, and
put on a white wrapper, and sat down on her trunk,
with the waist of the dress in her hand, and
pondered deeply. Not a detail of the costume of
her slender young sisters-in-law had escaped her.
She exaggerated the defects of her own, and
thought of herself as an unwieldy monster, and of
the black silk as a disfiguring abomination. Presently
she took a pair of scissors and rapidly ripped

<!-- page 88 -->

up the sleeves; then she tore off the tight little
band around the neck, and cut half an inch or so
of the shoulder seams. She gave a sigh as she
thought of the anxious care with which those
stitches had been put in, not many weeks ago, she
and her mother and Amanda Whittemore giving
their nights and days to them. How much more
she knew now, now that she had been three hours
in company with French dresses! If she were only
back there at home, with the clatter of Amanda's
machine, and the simmer of the tea-kettle on the
stove, and her mother's tired voice in her ear! She
smothered the homesick throb,&mdash;there was no time
now to be homesick; she must bend her whole
mind to reconstructing the black silk before to-morrow
night. It must be tied back, she said,
shaking out the skirt, tied back in two places,
and some of the fullness taken out of the back.
What had Amanda been thinking of! She had
made her a "figure of fun." Then she had a happy
thought. She went into the depths of her trunk
and drew out some lace, soft and pretty, and quite
presentable in these imitation days. She had
bought it of a dreadful woman who went about the
country with a big basket covered with oilskin,
and perjured herself many times a day for twenty
cents a yard, at every farmhouse. Ph&oelig;be unwound
it and shook it out. She turned up the
sleeves of her dress to the elbow, basted the silk
ruffles around them, and then put a double row of

<!-- page 89 -->

lace below. She looked with satisfaction on her
naked arm and wrist. She turned back the front
of the dress, with its vile satin buttons out of sight,
and pulled the lace around her neck, in the form
of a fichu that Lucy had worn. Yes, that was it,&mdash;
she had it; and she gave a sigh of relief. She put
all the things away in the trunk, lest Barry should
come up and see them; and then she shook down
her beautiful hair and brushed it out, standing before
the glass and knitting her brows as she
thought of the difference between her forehead
and Lucy's.</p>

<p>"I can't look like Lucy," she reflected, "but I
can wear my hair down in my neck."</p>

<p>She certainly could wear her hair low in her
neck. It went into that formula with soft docility.
It was the most "biddable" hair, like a fine poetic
nature with no resistance in it. It fell down in a
coil around Ph&oelig;be's arm as she took out the comb,
and with an instinct of caress she raised her arm
and laid it against her cheek. It was the sort of
hair you wanted to touch, and smooth, and lay
against your cheek.</p>

<p>Yes, she certainly could wear her hair twisted
in the back of her neck, like Lucy's. That was
demonstrated, and still deep in thought she began
to get ready for bed. Deep in thought, indeed; it
seemed as if she were being swallowed up in a
flood of new thoughts, impressions, fears. She had
the intuitive courage of youth, and her want of experience

<!-- page 90 -->

was in her favor, as experience of failure
is not inspiriting. She was so alone, she was at
such a disadvantage; she dared not guess with
what eyes these people looked upon her. And her
ignorance!&mdash;from the forms at their table and the
fashions of their dress to the sentiments of their
hearts and the religion of their souls, she was in
an ignorance the most profound. She dared not
ask Barry; she did not want him to know she did
not know. She could only gaze, guess, apprehend
with every sense, study with her whole being, put
every faculty into the silent work. She was perceptive,
she was young; she had the keen surface
intelligence of our countrywomen, and the habits
of mind fostered by the common-school system.
She had conquered the beetles and bugs of the
Holy Land. She would conquer the spoons and
forks of this higher civilization. She was self-reliant
because her nature was deep, and because in
it lay purposes and an experience that weighted it
beyond the wont of natures of her age. Her loneliness
was only comparative now. She had never
been used to confidences with her mother, and she
had outgrown her few school friends and been separated
from them since she left the illustrious seat
of learning where she had perfected herself in the
higher mathematics, and attained distinction in
chemistry and mental philosophy. As they said,
she had not been "a great hand" for intimacies,
and her little home had been rather smaller than

<!-- page 91 -->

any of theirs, and much remoter; and after her
distinguished success in graduating at the head of
her class, she had rather sunk out of sight of her
companions, and been only a tradition in the high
school town, for the year that had succeeded. It
was not new to her to feel alone, and not unnatural.
All the same, in this strange land, she
longed, with a tight feeling in her throat, for the
sight of her mother's anxious face; for the sound
of Amanda Whittemore's shrill chirrup, for the
thump of the dog's tail on the bare kitchen floor;
something that was not new; something that had
grown familiar in long, easy years; something,
just some one thing, that would not shock and
make her think; something that she could look at
or listen to, not speak to. It was not a necessity
to her to speak, happily.</p>

<p>The next evening, at seven, when the two
crossed the lawn on their way to the parental dinner,
Ph&oelig;be was a little in advance of her companion.</p>

<p>"What have you done to your dress?" he said.
"Has Honor been teaching you how to get yourself
up?"</p>

<p>Honor, indeed! thought Ph&oelig;be; but she only
said No; she hadn't seen Honor since the night
before.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you've done it very well by yourself."</p>

<p>She certainly had. The soft lace subdued the

<!-- page 92 -->

shiny black silk, and her white throat and beautiful
arms made one forget the offensiveness of it.
At her belt, just where she had seen Lucy put her
bouquet, she wore a bunch of splendid red roses.
The change in the arrangement of her hair made a
marked improvement in her appearance.</p>

<p>Barry repeated in a tone of complacency, "By
Jove, you've hit it exactly."</p>

<p>When a lover admires, it is adulation, homage,
he offers; when a husband approves, it is a mere
expression of complacency. The approvable qualities
belong to him; he feels that a demonstration
of satisfaction is but one remove from egotism.
It is all right, of course, but it is not quite
so pleasant. Ph&oelig;be gave a little inaudible sigh to
the memory of a happy past, and then accepted
meekly her husband's approbation. It was better
than his disapprobation, at least. At first she
had felt, rebelliously, that it was worse; but she
was not an unreasonable woman, and she was
making use of all her powers to fit herself into
her place and to be reconciled to it. Mental philosophy
and the higher mathematics had helped
her: she had cause to be thankful that all that
stimulates the imagination had been left out of
the arid curriculum of the Brixton High School.</p>

<p>She certainly had reason to be glad that she had
passed muster, as they walked across the lawn into
the very jaws of criticism, seated in solid ante-dinner
phalanx on the piazza. Barry's commendation,

<!-- page 93 -->

though it had chilled at first, like a cold
bath, invigorated her courage and sent a warm
glow through her as a secondary effect. The eyes
of her rival should not daunt her, since Barry
had said she had "hit it exactly."</p>

<p>The rival, the rival's aunt, Mr. Peyton Edwards,
and her father-in-law had all arrived in an earlier
train than the one in which the latter had come
the evening before, and had been driven up in a
superior carriage that had doubtless been ordered
from a livery stable to do honor to the guests.
As they had passed the cottage, there had been an
eager looking out. Barry had taken a holiday, as
he was not to go into business life at the office
till the next day. He had been loafing about all
day, unpacking his pipes and his books, rather
enjoying his discoveries about the little domain,
planning improvements and talking over ways and
means. The dread of the meeting was over, everything
had proved so much better than he had anticipated,
the getting home had been so pleasant
in many ways, that he had had a very contented
feeling. The day had been fine, even warmer
than yesterday, and it was bliss to be alive, and he
was young besides. When that superior carriage
passed, he was sitting in the little porch, in a
very loaferly attitude, smoking. He had forgotten
it was time for them to arrive. He had forgotten
that visitors must come sometimes, and come
awkwardly near his poor little door, and look inquisitively

<!-- page 94 -->

in at his poor little windows. He had
thought about it often enough, all winter long,
but he had spent a whole day, the world forgetting,
in a sunshiny, simple content, in which the
instincts of new home-making were entwined with
the memories of old home-loving. The rumble of
those wheels broke the charm. He started up and
returned the greeting of the new-comers very
gayly, but Ph&oelig;be from the window saw the dark
flush and contraction of the brow that succeeded.
He came hurriedly into the house and said it was
time to dress for dinner. During the hour that
followed, he found everything wrong: the dressing-room
door, the low window, the unutterable
stupidity of Mary Ann. How well Ph&oelig;be, though
the high school had not stimulated her imagination,
knew why the house had that moment grown
too small, the lot to which he had bound himself
too oppressively obscure! His cousin Tartar, with
her golden coins all jingling, had passed by. Discontent
had fluttered noiselessly in at the open
windows on little stinging wings, and when would
there again be peace at Humble Pie?</p>

<p>But when they were dressed and both of them
out in the calm summer afternoon, Barry recovered
himself a little. It always mended his
mood to be well washed and well dressed. He
felt his empire when he was <i>point device</i>. Nothing
ruffled him like being shabby and dusty. And
it was especially soothing to him that Ph&oelig;be

<!-- page 95 -->

looked so handsome. Handsome was a poor word;
it was not the word that fitted at all; it was stiff,
and wooden, and red-cheeked, and middle class.
You could not call her regal, with eyes so affectionate
and appealing; nor splendid, in her thin
black silk and imitation lace; nor magnificent,
with her silent, half-frightened manners; nor spiritual,
with all that wealth of flesh-and-blood perfection
(as flesh-and-blood perfection is considered
to be incompatible with spiritual perfection).
Beautiful is a word that like manna has a flavor to
each man of what he likes best. Perhaps each of
those who watched her come across the lawn and
approach the piazza thought, each in his or her
own way, How beautiful she is, after all! Aunt
David put up her glass to her elderly eyes, and
made the comment sharply <i>sotto voce</i>, nodding
her head as she did it. Mr. Crittenden, his head
a little bent down, looked out at her from under
his dark brows, and in his mind emphasized the
adjective which he had overheard. Peyton Edwards
moved aside as she came up the steps, and
his eyes followed her with something like wonder.
Honor had been telling Tartar about the black
silk, and Lucy had been looking deep reproach
at her for her disloyalty. Tartar almost caught
her breath,&mdash;with surprise, shall we say?&mdash;as
this singularly beautiful young woman entered
upon the scene.</p>

<p>She went through the introductions tolerably

<!-- page 96 -->

well; that is, she did not color, or stammer, or put
out her hand in the wrong place. She grew
rather pale, and did not do much but drop her
eyes and move her lips quite inaudibly as she was
presented to each person. It certainly would have
been better if she had bent her head a little, but
she seemed to have forgotten about that, or did
not know. Aunt David insisted on shaking hands
with her, so she had to look up for an instant during
that ceremony.</p>

<p>She saw a thin old woman, with a great many
wrinkles and a very bright eye.</p>

<p>"I've alwayth felt ath if Barry were my own
thon," she said, holding Ph&oelig;be's irresponsive
hand for a moment. "I hope you'll let me feel
that I have thom thiare in you."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked again furtively. She did not
make up her mind on the instant whether she was
prepared to say Aunt David was welcome to a
share in her or not. Aunt David was very interesting.
She was distinguished-looking; you
could see people always wanted to listen to her,
though she spoke with such a funny lisp, and liked
to look at her, though she was twisted with rheumatism
and wrinkled with age and yellow with
years of conflict with an ungrateful liver. The indefinable
flavor of beauty hung round its ruins; no
lack of physical completeness could take from her
the power to attract and please. She had been a
clever young woman, and she was a clever old

<!-- page 97 -->

woman, with a fire and force of will that made itself
still felt.</p>

<p>The meeting between her and Barry was very
warm. She took both his hands, and they had so
much to say to each other that he seemed almost to
have forgotten Tartar, who had spoken to Ph&oelig;be,
and was waiting to speak to him. At last he
turned to her; probably he had not forgotten her,
after all. She was evidently a little embarrassed,
but she did not fail to cloak it with a sharp little
flow of sarcasms, for which her sobriquet would
have prepared a stranger. Her name was Sarah,
but she had been called Tartar from her childhood,
which had been a very tempestuous and
spoiled one, under the guardianship of her Aunt
David, who had as sharp a tongue as she. Aunt
David publicly said she was the worst child in
the United States; but as she seemed to love
her better than any other child in the world, it
was rather offering a premium on badness. Aunt
David was strong-willed, but Tartar was stronger-willed.
With great frankness, they quarreled in
public as much as in private. Tartar openly bemoaned
her bad temper, but set it down to inheritance,
as if it had been rheumatism. Aunt David
was very worldly, and acknowledged it. Probably
they were both better than they chose to admit.
Tartar's temper was not unpleasant, and Aunt
David had a good deal of heart, notwithstanding
her worldliness.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

Tartar was rather taller than Lucy; not of
course so tall as Ph&oelig;be. She was dark, with blue-black
hair and flashing black eyes, a low forehead,
a thin, tolerably well-formed nose, deep dimples, a
fine mouth, a little too large, and teeth so white
that, in conjunction with the dimples and the
eyes, a smile had the effect of a sudden display of
fireworks, it was so sudden and dazzling. She
was decidedly thin, eminently well dressed.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be watched her furtively as Barry, after a
moment's welcome of Peyton Edwards, turned
back to her and began a low talk with her. She
stood by a pillar of the piazza, with the vines at
her back, slender, supple, aristocratic-looking, her
thin, small brown hands opening and shutting,
but not sharply, a fan that hung from her waist,
her very tiny and well-shod feet visible below her
short dress, one crossed before the other. There
was such a well-trained look about her, you
could not imagine her not having done everything
before.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be could not hear what Barry was saying
to her. (One hopes, of course, that she did not
want to hear.) He had an excellent manner with
women; it must have been native, for no one remembered
when he did not have it. There was
something between a caress and a supplication
in his tones. While he did not show any lack of
self-confidence,&mdash;on the contrary, his acts were
all based upon it,&mdash;that quality was not at all

<!-- page 99 -->

brought to the front; it was used as a base,
nothing more. Mistaken men, who allow it to
appear above ground! He possibly had a chivalrous
regard for women (also native), and he acted
out its dictates with a tentative sort of amusement.
He was never tired of the success of his
experiments; they were a continual source of innocent
enjoyment to him. It was delightful to
him to awaken Aunt David's enthusiasm; it was
equally charming to him to know that the two
young ladies whose tickets he had picked up in
the cars yesterday would thrill at the thought of
the adventure for a week. What could be more
harmless, more amiable? It was surely adding
to the sum of human happiness. One ought to
use one's gifts. If a person has a knack at fascination,
it must be the right thing to fascinate,&mdash;within
bounds.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was not quite prepared for the development
of this talent in her husband. She had
naturally been gratified at his popularity with her
mother and Amanda Whittemore. He had not
been thrown into any other female society in Malden.
As he was equally a hero in the eyes of Joe,
the "hired man," she had simply concluded that
he was perfect, and that every one of both sexes
must know it, sooner or later. Experiences were
multiplying upon her, and she did not know distinctly
what she was to think about anything.
Probably she had a look upon her face that indicated

<!-- page 100 -->

this frame of mind, for Lucy and her
mother both came towards her, with the object of
making her feel more at home and happy.</p>

<p>Now Ph&oelig;be was fatally quick in some of her
intuitions, and she instantly divined their purpose.
She was not obstinately bent on feeling unhappy
and not at home, but she did not find the condition
removed by the consciousness that they
were making this amiable effort to remove it.
Lucy did not dare to try the flowers again, having
found that her new sister did not respond the
night before. She also had a misgiving that they
would not have read the same books, that in literature
they had not any common ground. The
little search in her mind for something to talk
about made itself apparent in a want of ease and
sympathy of manner. Whatever it was she talked
about, it had, so far, led to nothing but "I don't
know," and "I hadn't ever thought about it."
Lucy looked so discouraged that her mother, who
had taken a seat on the other side of Ph&oelig;be,
and who was disguising her intent and anxious
listening by great attention to a piece of embroidery
in her hand, came to the rescue by asking
some question about the little <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. Did
Ph&oelig;be think that she could get along with Mary
Ann, by having some one in to wash?</p>

<p>Now to Ph&oelig;be Mary Ann herself was an unprecedented
luxury. What could she need of a
woman in to wash? What radical difference was

<!-- page 101 -->

there between the keeping of a little house in
Malden and the keeping of a little house in Marrowfat?
What did these people expect her to
do? She answered in much confusion that she
didn't want a woman in to wash, she thought.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may need her just at first," said
the mother, "before Mary Ann gets quite accustomed
to her work. I am afraid she is very inexperienced.
But you and Barry will always come
over here for your dinner, and that will make it
lighter for her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure we shan't have to do that,
ma'am."</p>

The prospect of an endless chain of dinners
like to-day and yesterday took away her breath
and startled her quite out of her confusion and
embarrassment. She spoke with a sincere deprecation
there was no mistaking. The mother smothered
a sigh as she saw the chagrin and apprehension
on her face. She could fancy Barry would
not prize the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te dinners cooked by Mary
Ann as much as she would. She had hoped they
as a family would not be so terrible to her; but
she had no one to thank for it but herself. She
thought of the poor bewildered, despairing mother
in her limp crape veil and shabby black dress,
making her way across the lawn in that November
rain. No wonder her daughter felt she was in an
enemy's country.</p>

<p>The way did not look very clear to Mrs. Crittenden

<!-- page 102 -->

as she bent her head over her embroidery.
All around her there was the sound of voices,
easy, merry, such as she had been used to hearing
in the happy times that were past. The piazza
looked like the old life. One could have imagined
it last summer, but for the silent daughter-in-law
at her elbow, whom Lucy was taxing her ingenuity
to entertain. Barry bending toward his gypsy-dark
cousin with his manner of devotion looked
like last summer: the picture of the two figures
had always given her keen satisfaction before,
and now it was with such a pang she looked at
them. Whichever way she turned, whatever she
saw, there came one thought. It was like a long
song with one termination to each verse. Have I
done right?</p>

<p>Peyton and Honor were talking to each other.
Mr. Crittenden was listening to Aunt David with
a half-absent smile, occasionally his eyes wandering
to the pair standing by the vine-clad pillar.
The declining sunshine shone across the piazza
from the west; the soft air was full of the faint
twitter of birds and the faint perfume of flowers
and leaves not yet matured. The shadows on the
lawn were making the rich, pure green of the new
grass beautiful where the sunshine struck it. The
external peacefulness and beauty of her home had
never seemed greater to her than at that moment.
But for the presence of the girl beside her, the internal
peacefulness and beauty might have been

<!-- page 103 -->

as great, it seemed to her. Had she done right?
Ah well, nothing could put them back to where
they were last June. It was useless to recall the
past. If Ph&oelig;be were not here in bodily presence,
there would be an intangible sin that would interfere
as much, perhaps, with the internal calm. But
it is difficult, in all moods, to credit the intangible
with its full power.</p>

<p>This Ph&oelig;be was a nightmare. Why was she
here? If she were not, all their contented pleasant
dreams would have seemed in the way of fulfillment.
Had they done right? She never could
divest herself of the feeling that she was accountable
for the marriage, and she alone. Without his
father's aid and permission Barry simply could not
have married, and she had no clew to the part his
wishes and his conscience had had in the matter.
Since she had seen the girl, she could imagine he
would have regretted parting from her; but there
had been nothing in his manner towards her to indicate
any such devotion as would render easy the
sacrifice of all his prospects of success. This episode
of her son's life was a sealed book to her:
about it she could only speculate. The part she
had played in it lay heavy at her heart. It is
hard that our convictions which are strong enough
to bear us into action have a way of balking and
weakening and turning coward when we are fairly
in the field. Now, when the consciousness of duty
fulfilled should have made her strong and helped

<!-- page 104 -->

her to overcome difficulties, she found her moral
forces in a panic. She would have given a great
deal to have seen Barry's marriage in the light in
which she had seen it during that week when she
gave her husband no rest till he had consented to
make it possible.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Lucy across the speechless
Ph&oelig;be, "don't you find Peyton looking thin? It
seems to me he has altered. He must have been
working hard."</p>

<p>"Let us call him here and ask him," said her
mother, laying her embroidery on her knee, and
giving up the problem of making Ph&oelig;be talk.
"Peyton, Lucy thinks you have been overworking,"
she said, raising her voice.</p>

<p>Peyton came across the piazza and stood before
them. Honor followed, for they were all on the
most intimate footing, and if Peyton was not a
cousin he ought to have been, for the frank affection
they all felt for him. He and Tartar and Barry
had been playmates from childhood. Lucy had
been a little younger, and not quite of the <i>camaraderie</i>,
while Honor had been the baby and play
thing of them all. Peyton was as tall as Barry,
but not as well filled out. He was not thin, exactly;
muscular, probably. His shoulders were a
little squarer than most men's, and he gave one the
impression of awkwardness; but he was not awkward,
at least if awkwardness means want of ease.
He was easy. He had no trouble about the disposition

<!-- page 105 -->

of his limbs. He moved well enough. It
was chiefly when one compared him to Barry that
he gave the impression of being wanting in grace.
He was not, either, a handsome man. His hair
was a light, very light, brown; he had been one of
those tow-headed, freckled, little-nosed, blue-eyed
boys, of whom one wonders that anybody but
their mothers know them, there are so many of
them in every school and in every town and village.
One is moved to admire the quality of
indefeasible individuality that belongs to all the
works of creation, that they are so known. What
made Peyton Edwards to differ from his many
little similar fellows it would have been difficult
to say. He did not shine in anything; he was
generally to be found in the middle of his class,
not by any chance to be mistaken for the head or
the foot; he was not especially anything but himself.
But he was himself, and people that knew
him well, liked him, and people that did not, did
not think much about him. He was the Fidus
Achates of Barry Crittenden. Mrs. Crittenden,
who speculated a great deal about her children's
preferences, decided it must be because he was of
a neutral tint, which suited the gorgeous efflorescence
of Barry, as a gay clump of hollyhocks
would choose, if they could be asked, a gray stone
wall for a background. It was possible she underrated
him. She had a kind interest in him; but
how could any one, used to the contemplation of

<!-- page 106 -->

Barry, see anything more than qualities to inspire
a kind interest, in him? It was the habit of the
family to speak of Barry's affection for him as
something which reflected great credit on his (Barry's)
kindness of heart. His devotion to Barry
explained itself.</p>

<p>The contrast between the freckled little commonplace
and the young Adonis had decreased
somewhat as the years went on. The freckles
had disappeared and given place to a decent tan;
the sinewy urchin had lengthened out into a muscular,
if not graceful, youth. His hair was not
quite so sandy, and his mustache not a bad color.
His blue eyes had always been nice in expression,
even to those who thought they looked like everybody
else's blue eyes. His nose partook of the
general neutrality of his features. If questioned
about it five minutes after parting with him, you
would not have been able to give any satisfactory
account of it. His mouth, what one could divine
of it under his mustache, was good, and his chin by
no means lacked firmness. He was silent but he
was not stupid, withdrawing but not hanging back,
shy but not shamefaced.</p>

<p>When he came across the piazza, in consequence
of Mrs. Crittenden's observation about his overworking,
he stood by the railing before her without
embarrassment, though with no bravado, and
answered the personal remark very simply.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Crittenden," he said, "I don't think

<!-- page 107 -->

I've been overworking, but I should have been if
I'd done any more. It doesn't hurt you, you
know, up to a certain point. I think I've learned
just where the point is, and I always stop this side
of it."</p>

<p>"Does Barry know?" said Honor. "You ought
to drive in a stake and not let him go beyond.
He might injure himself. He begins going to the
office to-morrow, and we don't want him broken
down."</p>

<p>And then they laughed, as if Barry's laziness
were a classic jest in the family. Ph&oelig;be reddened.
She knew it was unreasonable that his own mother
and sisters should not be at liberty to make jokes
about him; but it was horrid to feel anybody
could do it. Till now she had known more of him
than any one else; now she seemed to know less,
and have less right. Peyton saw the color spread
over her beautiful face, upon which he was looking
down.</p>

<p>"Barry'll work hard enough now, you needn't
be afraid," he said, and then he turned the talk
away from the matter. Presently Ph&oelig;be looked
up, actually looked up into his face, and anon said
something of her own accord. It was the very
smallest observation, a mere bubble in the ice of
silence, but it gave Mrs. Crittenden a world of encouragement.</p>

<p>"These two silent people understand each other,"
she thought. "We are too diffuse, and drown out
their faint possibilities."</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>She based upon this a re-arrangement of the
dinner-table. Peyton sat by Ph&oelig;be, and Barry
took Tartar in. It certainly was a good distribution,
and helped the poor country girl very much.
She needed help. What with their strange things
to eat and their strange ways of eating them, the
freedom and familiarity of their manners with her
husband, the strained and anxious character of
their manners with her, her natural reserve, her
unavoidable ignorance, her heaviness of heart, her
consciousness of blame, it is surely quite apparent
that she needed help. It was undeniable help to
sit by one who would have been nearly as silent
as herself if they had left him alone, and who undoubtedly
understood how silent people felt. He
took care of her, too, in little ways that he could
not have done if he had been busy in talking the
strange nonsense about strange people that occupied
the others. A dismal certainty was creeping
over Ph&oelig;be,&mdash;a certainty that she should never be
at home here, that she was more out of place even
than she had feared. She felt so dull. Her small
powers seemed to be shrinking into nothing. The
talk at the table no doubt was bright and vivacious,
but nothing more; the easy chat of well-bred
people who know each other intimately and have
a hundred points of common interest. She did not
know the names even of those they talked about.
She could not understand the allusions they made.
The language they spoke was not the language of

<!-- page 109 -->

Malden, nor yet of high school Brixton. Her
heart ached, or rather it was numb. A deadly
sort of homesickness filled her for a home to which
she did not want to go. When she had come
away from Malden, it was with a feeling of shaking
the dust off her feet. The events of the past
few months had embittered her recollection of
home. Companions and neighbors of her whole
life had stood aloof in her time of trouble; bitter
and sweet were bound up in her memories of the
little hamlet, but the bitter were stronger than
the sweet, and she could not turn to them with
comfort in this dreary time.</p>

<p>She was so afraid some one would see she could
not eat. Peyton saw, but she did not mind him,
and her mother-in-law, but she did not say anything.</p>

<p>There were two windows towards the west, in
the room, and the pink sky shed through them a
lovely light. Through the south windows came
glimpses of the orchard, and the tree-tops in the
ravine, and the blue hills beyond. The table, to
Ph&oelig;be unfamiliar with the details of such service,
looked glittering and gay, and almost magnificent.
The odors of the wine, the flowers, and the unknown
dishes made it seem to her like a feast of
royalty. In plain fact, it was a nice little well-served
dinner, for which Lucy had decanted a bottle
of her father's best sherry which had considerable
bouquet, in honor of Aunt David, and for which

<!-- page 110 -->

she had gathered her prettiest flowers in honor of
her dearest Barry's coming back to them once more.
If it was a feast of royalty, it was the inner kind,&mdash;the
royalty of high natures and pure affections.
But whatever it was, Ph&oelig;be felt it was not her
place to sit at it. She looked across, when she
dared, to Barry, to see if he had no look or word to
help her with. But how could he help her? There
was Tartar on one side and Aunt David on the
other, and such a fire of pleasantry to be answered
as left him no moment for her. Honor was on her
side of the table beyond Peyton. She was in a
very saucy mood, and was not sparing any one,
except Ph&oelig;be, whom she had forgotten, probably.
Even the father, careworn and severe, had a relaxed
though half-cynical smile on his face. Tartar
was a great favorite with him. The half of
the smile that was genuine was due to his pleasure
that she was their guest, the half that was cynical,
to the fact that she could never be anything
else. He had recently been growing a great respect
for wealth, an unwholesome crop that is
pretty sure to spring up after a devastating financial
trouble. It was surely something to be cynical
about, to have let a clever, handsome girl,
with half a million, slip through one's fingers, and
to have brought up instead such a lifeless, heavy
piece of flesh and blood as he was obliged to recognize
as his son's wife. They had been a pack
of fools. He could not even look at her, but

<!-- page 111 -->

turned his eyes away, and watched Barry and his
cousin instead. Barry had a little flush on his
cheek; he was merry, and his delicious mirth-provoking
laugh interlarded the conversation liberally.</p>

<p>"Barry hathn't forgotten how to laugh," said
Aunt David. Aunt David liked the little dinner;
it was thoroughly good. She liked the best sherry
and the flowers; she liked the company. She even
had an eye for the rose-flushed sky and the good
view from the south windows. She was very well
suited with her surroundings; and if she had a
regret for the alliance rendered impossible by the
presence of the passive bride opposite, she had the
good sense not to show it. There was no cynicism
apparent in the flattering, almost fond attention
which she lavished on Barry.</p>

<p>"He hathn't forgotten how to laugh," she said.
"My dear," to Ph&oelig;be, "doeth he alwayth laugh
like that, even when you are by your two
thelveth?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked up, and tried to answer steadily;
it was the first word she had been required to say
in public, as it were, for every one was listening
now, and her monosyllables to Peyton had not
counted before.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe he does mostly, ma'am."</p>

<p>What was it in these very simple words that
made Barry redden, that made Tartar suddenly
bend over and begin to crumb into fragments the
bread beside her plate, that plainly disconcerted

<!-- page 112 -->

Lucy, and made Aunt David press her thin lips
together involuntarily, and begin vehemently to
talk about something else? Ph&oelig;be wondered.
She ran over the sentence in her mind: she parsed
it by the best Brixton method, she scanned it, she
turned it inside out, she tried to divine any hidden
meaning. She knew it did not sound like Tartar,
or Lucy, or Honor. Wherein lay the difference?
It was right, but it was wrong; perhaps it was
mostly, perhaps it was that wretched ma'am.
She remembered with a sort of faintness that she
had never heard any one but the servants say
ma'am here. Her face grew red as she sat, with
downcast eyes, thinking it over. Why hadn't
Barry told her? But then he couldn't tell her
everything. He shouldn't mind such a little
thing, but he <i>did</i> mind; she could see that. She
spent the rest of dinner planning what she would
say to him when they should be alone; how she
would tell him he needn't be afraid, she'd never
say ma'am again to any of his people, not even to
his greatest grandmother. Ph&oelig;be could be passionate,
sarcastic, everything, in her imaginary
speeches, with all the greater freedom that she
knew she never would get them said in real fact.
When she came to wanting to say them, some
mysterious power raised the drawbridge of speech,
and she was left spell-bound, a moat of silence
round her.</p>

<p>It certainly had sounded provincial, that meek

<!-- page 113 -->

little answer of Ph&oelig;be's to Aunt David. It was
not to be denied that besides the offensive ma'am
and undesirable mostly there was an intonation&mdash;faint,
it is true, but defined&mdash;that marked the distance
between Brixton and the great city. Her
voice was so sweet that the ear once familiar with
the accent forgot it as anything offensive. Barry
had been used to it for so many months, he had
forgotten the offense; hearing, in fact, no speech
that differed from it except in degree of provincialism.
But now, with Tartar's fine, clear tones
in his ear, with the subtly different voices of educated
people all around him, he heard it, and he
reddened. He was not to blame for that. No
body walks the earth who has kept himself from
reddening by an effort of the will.</p>

<p>When they were once away from the table, she
breathed freer. It was something to be out of
range of the eyes of that terrible old woman and
that no less terrible young one. Her immediate
relatives became almost friends in comparison. She
knew they did not want her laughed at, for their
own sakes. She did not believe they would permit
any disrespect in speaking of her; hard and
unloving as she believed the parents of her husband
to be towards her, she knew they would in a
sense protect her against the world. It was therefore
not with a fear that she was to be discussed
that she saw Mr. Crittenden go down the steps
with Tartar and turn in the direction of the garden.

<!-- page 114 -->

The young lady had put her hand through
her guardian's arm; he laid his own over it in a
caressing manner, unusual with him even with his
own children. It was quite understood in the family
that Tartar was in high favor with him. He
was now taking her away to see his vegetables, in
which interest she was very sympathetic. Peyton
did not leave Ph&oelig;be. They sat down on the
piazza. Presently Aunt David and Barry wandered
away in the direction of the garden, too.
The old lady leaned upon him confidently. She
was talking constantly, and Barry was laughing
and animated. Lucy was playing a symphony of
Beethoven in the twilight of the library. Honor
fed her cats under a snow-ball bush which had
been their dining-room for many seasons. Her
mother gave audience to a departing seamstress at
the other end of the piazza.</p>

<p>"Shan't we walk to the gate?" said Peyton,
who had seen a longing look towards the little
cottage on his companion's face. She had in fact
been feeling she would fly there if she dared; she
was homesick and unhappy, and that was her only
shelter. It was something to walk past it, and
she got up to go with him. Peyton looked about
him, as they reached the path, with an affectionate
familiarity. The soft evening light made
the cottage rather indistinct through the trees,
whereas in the day it was only too apparent.
Mary Ann's dish-cloths were always in distinct

<!-- page 115 -->

view from the piazza, and an indiscreet saucepan
set out to cool would be a picture from the parlor
window. With different degrees of bitterness,
these anticipated trials had been dwelt upon in
the silent minds of the mistress of the big house
and the mistress of the cottage. But "dewy
eve her curtain draws over the world's turmoil."
The cottage looked dim, bowery, picturesque, incapable 
of dish-cloths and sauce-pans. Peyton
told Ph&oelig;be, as they walked slowly along the carriage
road, that he believed he knew every inch of
the inclosure, and could draw a map of every tree
and shrub, and every angle of the fence. He
showed her where Barry and he had their rabbit
hutch, where they built their snow-forts, and
pointed out where the coasting was in winter and
where the little tents in summer. Ph&oelig;be liked to
hear the story of her husband's boyhood from
Peyton; she was willing that he should have
known him before she did.</p>

<p>They went to the gate and looked up and down
the road, and then sauntered slowly back. As
they neared the cottage, coming upon it from its
parlor end, where it looked best, Peyton glanced
with interest towards it, and said, how they had
changed it, how pretty it was.</p>

<p>"Won't you go in and look at it?" she asked,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>He was very glad to go, and they went in to
the little porch. It was very dim there, and

<!-- page 116 -->

they stumbled a little, getting inside the door.
There Peyton stood, leaning against the post,
while Ph&oelig;be sought the matches and made a light.
He watched her while she carried the candle, with
its pale light, to the table where the lamp stood.
Her movements were graceful and free here on
her own ground. The light sprang up warmly
under her touch, and the pretty little room seemed
anything but despicable to Peyton, with such a
Juno as its permanent endowment. He came in,
and they went around the room, moving chairs
and tables judiciously to be able to do it, and examined
the little ornaments, and the mirror frame
that Lucy had painted, and the lambrequin that
Honor had worked. They both looked pretty
large for the room when they were standing up,
but soon they sat down, and did the rest of their
talking at a better advantage. It was a good
while before Peyton glanced up at the clock and
said he didn't know it was so late. Didn't she
think they ought to go back now? A cloud came
over her face at once, and the stiff, embarrassed
speech returned.</p>

<p>"I don't think I need go back," she said, not
moving. Peyton looked troubled.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they'll expect you."</p>

<p>"I don't think it'll make any difference," she
returned.</p>

<p>"I know, of course, you're one of them," he
said. "I should think&mdash;that is, if one can feel so

<!-- page 117 -->

about people that are not really one's own&mdash;that
you will be very&mdash;much attached&mdash;to them in a
little while. I've been here so much, ever since
I was a little shaver, I feel as if I knew them inside
and out."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not offer any opposition, neither did
she seem to acquiesce.</p>

<p>The trouble on Peyton's face did not pass away.
"I've always thought," he said, slowly, "that Mrs.
Crittenden was the best woman in the world."</p>

<p>Still Ph&oelig;be did not answer, but sat looking
down, passing slowly backward and forward over
the lap of her dress a spray of honeysuckle that
she held in her hand.</p>

<p>"She's always just," he said, "and that isn't
an every-day thing, you know. She has a good
judgment like a man, and yet a soft heart like a
woman." Ph&oelig;be probably thought of the domiciliary
visit of the poor widow from Malden, for
her lips grew tight and her forehead a trifle
creased. Peyton saw he was not making a good
thing of it.</p>

<p>"I suppose she's reserved," he said,&mdash;"not one
of those women that take an interest in every
body; but once your friend always your friend.
I think she would help any one she meant well to,
consistently, in great matters and small, to the
end of her life. I think consistency is a great
thing, don't you? So few people are consistent
all the way through; it takes a great deal more

<!-- page 118 -->

character than to be anything else; you use up so
much in qualities that aren't generally noticed."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Ph&oelig;be, not absent-mindedly,
but absent-heartedly.</p>

<p>"It's difficult to say why you think different
people will like each other," said Peyton, awkwardly,
getting up, with his head very near the
ceiling, "but I felt sure, from the moment I saw
you, that you and Mrs. Crittenden would be good
friends. You know Barry is like a brother to me,
and I couldn't wish him better luck than to have
his mother and his wife get on together."</p>

<p>The paths of diplomacy are very thorny, especially
in their earlier stages. This was Peyton's
first essay in social finesse, and he had no reason
to feel elated with his success. He felt very hot
and embarrassed, as he went out into the dark
alone and remembered what he had said. He was
afraid he had been more than questionably impertinent:
what possible right had he to force his
advice upon this unhappy girl, whose dignity
touched him instead of chilling him? He could
not explain to himself what had moved him to
speak, when in every other situation in life he
would have kept silence. But the feeling had
been too strong for him; even now he felt that, if
it were to be done over again, he would do the
same. He saw the trouble the poor young wife
was in, and the rescue that was held out to her.
How could he make her see and take hold of the

<!-- page 119 -->

rope that was within her reach? It would have
been impossible for him to speak to Mrs. Crittenden;
it would be equally impossible for him to
speak to Barry. Why it was possible for him to
speak to Ph&oelig;be was one of those mysteries that
one has to accept, and not solve, in the matter of
reticent natures. When one thinks of the varied
forms of misunderstanding that are possible in a
world peopled with such varied tempers, temperaments,
whims, wills, concealments, prejudices, and
perplexities, it seems amazing, not that there is so
much discord, but that there is anything else. It
is difficult to decide whether the outspoken people
or the inarticulate people contribute most to the
general misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Peyton walked up and down in the shrubbery
several minutes before he could get sufficiently
over the sense of oppression that these thoughts
suggested, to go into the house. He must let them
go their way, he supposed, but it was a bad job.
He only wondered that anybody lived in peace,
since there are so many bad people in the world;
what must be their condition, when these good
ones seemed to have such difficulty in coming to
an understanding!</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's reflections were not so general in their
character, but even more oppressive. After Peyton
went away, she moved restlessly about the
small premises for a little while; then, with a wise
instinct to seek employment as a defense against

<!-- page 120 -->

bad thoughts, went groping her way up the narrow
stairs. There was a little work-basket in a
corner, which she found without a light. There
was comfort even in the touch of it. It was
hidden work,&mdash;no one had ever seen it, not even
Barry; but into those little garments she stitched
her teeming thoughts. Sore and bitter ones had
given way many times as she bent over the pretty
cambric; so, with this charm in her hand, she
went down the crabbed little stairs again. As
she laid her hand on the latch of the stair door to
push it open, she heard voices, and looking through
the crack she saw Tartar and Barry standing on
the threshold.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Barry, preceding her.</p>

<p>"It is irregular," returned Tartar, hesitating.
"I shouldn't come till Mrs. Barry is here to receive
me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," cried Barry, a little annoyed.
"Country people, in our position, do not stand on
etiquette."</p>

<p>"Don't say anything more like that," said Tartar,
rather seriously. "Do you know, it sounds
bitter."</p>

<p>But still she did not cross the sill that divided
the parlor from the porch, and only looked curiously
into the lighted little room.</p>

<p>"Overcome your scruples," exclaimed Barry,
taking her hand; "it isn't the first time you and
I have been in this room together."</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"No," she cried, with a merry laugh, following
him. "Do you remember the day we brought
the duck's eggs to Mrs. Flanigan, and got her to
let us make an omelet on the cooking-stove that
stood there? And oh, what a smell of soap-suds
and cabbage! The windows were covered with
steam, and the room was furiously hot. I shall
never forget how ill I felt, and how the dreadful
stuff she gave us to fry the omelet in flew over
on the stove, and added to the bouquet."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barry, laughing. "You got so
white that I was dreadfully frightened, and took
you out."</p>

<p>"And rubbed snow in my face, to revive me."</p>

<p>"No, by Jupiter, that I deny! Nothing so ungallant."</p>

<p>"I remember the snow distinctly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it was Peyton who did it. It
sounds like Peyton."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peyton!" cried Tartar, with an almost
imperceptible chill of manner. "Peyton wouldn't
have seen that I was white. Besides, he wasn't
with us that day. He had gone back to school
that morning; I remember it distinctly. You
had two days' longer holiday."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Barry, with a sigh. "Those were
happy days, Tartar. I wonder if life will offer
us anything better."</p>

<p>"Than duck omelet and Mrs. Flanigan? Oh,
I hope so."</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p>"Ah, come," said Barry, with the touch of sentiment
that one must always expect when men
speak of their boyhood, "you can't make me believe
you don't sometimes remember those times
with regret."</p>

<p>"I don't want to make you believe anything
of the kind. Of course <i>I</i> regret them, already in
the spinster sere and yellow; but for you, in your
honeymoon, as it were,&mdash;oh, fie!"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not hear what answer Barry made
to this; it was rather low, and was interrupted
by Tartar's sudden movement to investigate the
changes in the room.</p>

<p>"This surely is new," she said,&mdash;"this funny
little window in the corner."</p>

<p>"No; don't you remember Mrs. Flanigan used
to keep her milk-pans outside? We borrowed
one without permission once, on some occasion, to
tie on Major's tail. It got a good deal damaged,
and I think the rupture between Mr. Flanigan
and his master was mainly due to the little misunderstanding
which resulted."</p>

<p>"I remember! I remember!" cried Tartar,
with a peal of laughter. "Oh, Barry, to <i>think</i> of
your living in Flanigan's cottage!"</p>

<p>"Yes, to think of it," said Barry, with a frown,
walking up and down the very small space that
there was to walk up and down in, in that room.
"Time's changes, Tartar."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Tartar, mockingly, "it might

<!-- page 123 -->

be worse. You might have had Flanigan's dinner
as well as Flanigan's house to eat it in. Now I'm
sure Mrs. Ph&oelig;be doesn't give you cabbage."</p>

<p>"Nor duck omelet," said Barry, stiffly.</p>

<p>"No, nor duck omelet, as I did. So, you see,
your fate might have been worse. Ah, now I
like that little fire-place. Whose idea was it
putting those shelves above? Honor's, I'm sure.
Honor is such a clever little thing. Why, I really
think I almost like Flanigan's parlor. It's&mdash;the
drollest little place. Barry, tell me one thing
candidly"&mdash;</p>

<p>But Barry's candor was never put to the test,
for outside the door came a reproving voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tartar! you here! How doth it happen?
Ith the Mithreth of the houth at home?"</p>

<p>"No, aunt; this is irregular. Barry made me
come in."</p>

<p>"Then I will make you come out."</p>

<p>"Ah, who ever made Tartar do anything?"
said Mr. Crittenden, advancing across the threshold.
But Aunt David refused to follow him, saying
she would not enter the cottage till its young
mistress was at home to receive her. Mr. Crittenden
gave a curious glance around, and silently
followed her without entering further. Tartar
pouted a little, and said they must go, notwithstanding
the protestations of Barry, who would
have detained her. And so their voices died
away down the road. Aunt David was tired with

<!-- page 124 -->

her long walk through the vegetable gardens and
around the grounds. The quartette who had
started out to look at cauliflower and beans went
slowly back, having seen some other things perhaps
as entertaining.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be pushed open the door, after they had
gone, with her work in her hands, and a burning
color on her cheek. She sat down by the lamp,
and worked a full hour before her husband's step
crossed the little porch.</p>

<p>"How long have you been at home?" he said.
"When I went to find you, just now, Peyton said
he'd left you here."</p>

<p>Evidently he had not been frightened about
her, which was no doubt what she had been hoping
during the hour she had been waiting for him.
What woman is above hoping her husband may
get frightened about her? Desirable as confidence
is, solicitude is more subtly flattering. Ph&oelig;be explained
the circumstances of her return in a voice
of which the tremor was not perceptible. Then
Barry threw himself into a chair by the window,
and smoked, but did not talk. By and by he
tossed his cigar away, and sat gazing out into the
darkness; after a while, he got up and said it was
bedtime, and he was tired, and, without further
amplification, made his way up the narrow little
staircase to his room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">MARROWFAT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two or three Sundays after their arrival in
Marrowfat, Ph&oelig;be found many good reasons for
not going to church, the principal, but least prominently
mentioned, being that she had not any
summer bonnet. Going to church had never been
a well-defined duty in her mind. She had got
farther and farther from it as she grew up. Logically,
she could not see why she might not as
well read a good book at home, when she had no
nice bonnet to go in. Since edification was all
that she had been instructed to look for, she felt
she found it better in a chapter or two of the
"Saint's Rest," in old brown calf and yellow
pages with long <i>s</i>'s, than in the diluted platitudes
of the worthy minister of the Congregational
meeting-house at Malden. The brethren who
found their way to that remote village were not
generally of high cultivation or keen intellect.
The sanctuary in winter smelled of hot iron, and
made her head ache, and in summer glared with
white paint, and produced the same effect. When
she had her new clothes and the weather was fine,
it was very nice to go and see how they compared

with other people's; when she had not, it was not
clear to her why she might not stop at home
without offense. This was a great sorrow to her
mother, who was not logical. She considered it
your duty to hear a sermon once a week, whether
you had a good bonnet or not. If it did not do
you any good, it was your own fault; it ought to
do you good, and The Sermon was not to blame.
Preaching she looked upon as a sort of eighth
sacrament; one might almost say a unique sacrament.
Ph&oelig;be, with a very earnest desire always
to do right, but with that unfortunate turn for
logical correctness which she must have inherited
from her father (since her mother did not even
know it when she saw it), could not accept the
dogma. If all you went to church for was to be
done good to, you'd better stay at home when
you found it did not do you any good; that is,
unless it amused you or pleased somebody else.</p>

<p>Therefore it happened that she had been three
weeks in Marrowfat before she went to church.
It was a warm, lovely June day, and she walked
with Barry under the shade of the wide elms, in a
perfectly satisfactory white muslin dress, and a
coarse straw bonnet, trimmed with white mull.
At her belt she wore a large bunch of the dark
red roses that seemed to have blown for her particular
adornment. Barry had looked at her with
complacency; she knew she was all right. They
were rather late; that is, the bell had stopped

<!-- page 127 -->

ringing, and the pews were all filled, and the clergyman
was just entering from the sacristy, when
they reached the door. It was an old stone
church, with many vines about it, greensward,
and fine trees. It looked much more agreeable to
Ph&oelig;be than the bare and unadorned ecclesiastical
edifices of Malden and Brixton, and she thought
she should probably be well enough pleased to
come often, if Barry wanted to.</p>

<p>The organist was playing a low and unobtrusive
strain; the clergyman, having just entered, was on
his knees, where, unfortunately, the congregation
had not followed him. They were all ready to
criticise the young couple who now walked down
the silent aisle; very far down, too, they were
obliged to walk. It was the one moment in the
week when they would be most conspicuous.
Barry felt it, and an unconciliatory hauteur
straightened his shoulders. Ph&oelig;be felt it, and her
color went and came in a very pretty manner.
They were as handsome a pair as had ever trod
that aisle. Marrowfat held its breath and looked
at them. After all, it is possible to be too good-looking.
This was the first glimpse they had had
of Ph&oelig;be, for everybody had been hanging back,
and no one had liked to be the first to call. They
were prepared to see some one dowdy, or flashy,
or commonplace. They were prepared to be
deeply sorry for the family downfall.</p>

<p>For the whole story had been current for

<!-- page 128 -->

months in the place. A journeyman tailor in
Marrowfat had married a wife in Greene County,
who had a cousin who had moved to Malden and
bought out the keeper of the village "store" two
years before; and there was not a detail of the
unfortunate matter that was not talked over the
counters of every shop in Marrowfat before it was
a month old. We never can be sure how much
our friends know or what they are saying of us,
and the Crittendens could not be blamed for hoping
that distance and obscurity had hidden the
sorrowful truth from their neighbors. That Barry
had made a rash and undesirable marriage could
not be concealed, but the whole truth, surely, one
might reasonably have hoped need not be published.</p>

<p>But it had been published, illustrated and embellished;
and in the face of it here were Barry
and his wife walking down the aisle with their
heads up. If Barry had looked shabby, dethroned,
undefiant; if his wife had had mouse-colored hair,
thin shoulders, a dull skin, or a bad walk, this
story might never have been told, and virtuous
Marrowfat have added to its virtues that of a large
and liberal charity. It is easy to forgive acknowledged
defeat; it is hard to forgive defiant success.
Barry looked a greater swell than ever, and his
wife was so much handsomer than anybody else in
Marrowfat that it was simple nonsense to talk of
ignoring the past. If one did not want to be

<!-- page 129 -->

walked over by these young persons they must be
put down; self-preservation joined hands with virtuous
indignation; to cancel the past would be to
sacrifice the future. Scarce a mother in Marrowfat
but felt a bitter sense of injury as she thought
of Barry. Not only had he set the worst possible
example to her sons, but he had overlooked the
charms of her daughters; not only had he outraged
public opinion, but he had disappointed private
hopes. Society should hold him to a strict
account; Marrowfat was not to be trifled with
when it came to matters of principle.</p>

<p>It was an old town, with ante-Revolutionary
traditions; there was no mushroom crop allowed
to spring up about it. New people were permitted,
but only on approbation of the old. It
was not the thing to be very rich in Marrowfat, it
was only tolerated; it was the thing to be a little
cultivated, a little clever, very well born, and very
loyal to Marrowfat. It was not exactly provincial;
it was too near the great city and too much mixed
up with it to be that; but it was very local, and it
had its own traditions in an unusual degree. That
people grew a little narrow and very much interested
in the affairs of the town, after living there
a while, was not to be wondered at. It is always
the result of suburban life, and one finds it difficult
to judge, between having one's nature green
like a lane, even if narrow, or hard and broad like
a city pavement, out of which all the greenness

<!-- page 130 -->

has been trampled and all the narrowness thrown
down.</p>

<p>The climate of the place was dry and pure: it
was the fashion for the city doctors to send their
patients there, and many who came to cough remained
to build. The scenery was lovely: you
looked down pretty streets and saw blue hills beyond;
the sidewalks were paved and the town
was lit by gas, but the pavements led you past
charming homes to bits of view that reminded you
of Switzerland, and the inoffensive lamp-posts
were hidden under great trees by day, and by
night you only thought how glad you were to see
them. The drives were endless, the roads good;
there were livery-stables, hotels, skilled confectioners,
shops of all kinds, a library, a pretty little
theatre, churches of every shade of faith, schools
of every degree of pretension; lectures in winter,
concerts in summer, occasional plays all the year;
two or three local journals, the morning papers
from the city at your breakfast table; fast trains,
telegraphs, telephones, all the modern amenities
of life under your very hand; and yet it was the
country, and there were peaceful hills and deep
woods, and the nights were as still as Paradise.
Can it be wondered at that, like St. Peter's at
Rome, it had an atmosphere of its own, and defied
the outer changes of the temperature?</p>

<p>Marrowfat certainly was a law unto itself.
Why certain people were great people, in its

<!-- page 131 -->

view, it would be difficult to say. Why the telegraphs
and the telephones, and the fashionable
invalids from the city, and the rich people who
bought and built in its neighborhood, did not
change its standards of value one can only guess.
But it had a stout moral sentiment of its own; it
had resisted innovations and done what seemed it
good for a long while; and when you have made
a good moral sentiment the fashion, or the fact by
long use, you have done a good thing. Marrowfat
never tolerated married flirtations, looked
askance on extremes in dress or entertainment,
dealt severely with the faults of youth. All these
things existed more or less within its borders, of
course, but they were evil doings and not approved
doings.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, Marrowfat was the most
charitable town in the world; in another the most
uncharitable. If you were to have any misfortune
befall you, Marrowfat was the place to go to have
it in: if you lost your money, if you broke your
back, if your children died, if your house burned
down, Marrowfat swathed you in flowers, bathed
you in sympathy, took you out to drive, came and
read to you, if need were took up subscriptions
for you. But if you did anything disgraceful or
discreditable, it is safe to say you would better
have done it in any other place.</p>

<p>It may be said that Barry, having dwelt there
all his life, should have known better than to have

<!-- page 132 -->

come back there to live, with such a stain upon
him. But in truth we are not apt to analyze the
atmosphere we breathe; he had not realized the
severity of it while he was in good social health.
He had been a great favorite, an eminently
important person, man and boy; it had always
seemed to him that the sun shone in Marrowfat
all the year round, and almost all the twenty-four
hours in the day. The Crittendens had been as
important people as there were in Marrowfat. If
there was any blue blood in the place it certainly
flowed in their veins. Mr. Crittenden was approved
for being a son of the soil, and for having
done credit to the soil in his subsequent career.
Mrs. Crittenden was approved for her many good
qualities, for her talents, and for her ready adaptation
of herself to the place. The children were
approved for their good looks and good manners.
The family were in fact quite model citizens.
When their style of living improved with improving
fortune, their neighbors were tolerant of
the change; when Barry put on airs, they were
rather proud of him; when Honor refused to
speak to the milliner's daughter at the rink, they
secretly sustained her. It seemed impossible for
them to do amiss. Mrs. Crittenden was indispensable
to all the clubs, book, musical, charitable;
nothing could be done without her. Her entertainments
were assured successes; her ways of managing
were spoken of with respect; her methods

<!-- page 133 -->

with her children, with her vegetables, with the
languages, were equally superior. Her son was
the best match in Marrowfat, her daughters were
pretty, her house was always open in easy hospitality.
It was no wonder she was an important
person.</p>

<p>But now all this was to be changed. That
amid the waving field of general approbation
there must have been some secret seeds of envy,
the harvest proved. Aristides must pay for his
title; one cannot be just and be called just and
have only glory always with impunity. It was
amazing, the rapidity with which the opinion
spread that Mrs. Crittenden was an overrated person,
that she had made many mistakes in judgment,
that she had brought up her children badly,
that the girls were assuming, that no words could
say what Barry was or what he would become.
It was plain, also, from the retrenchments they
were making, that they had been living beyond
their means. It was even rumored they were
heavily in debt; trades-people were vaguely
warned not to let their accounts run on too long.
It was evident that theirs was no longer a house
whence much amusement would emanate. Then
Virtue stepped in and said, "Is it a house where
one ought to go? Give me your hand and come
out with distinction, and give no countenance to
the doings of this young libertine."</p>

<p>When one can make a show of virtue, and vent

<!-- page 134 -->

a long-cherished spite, and lose not even a whist-party
by it, human nature cannot be expected to
resist. It was a most fatal addition of fuel to
this fire when Barry straightened his shoulders
so defiantly as he went down the aisle, on the occasion
of his first appearance with his wife. And
Ph&oelig;be's two weeks' labor over that pretty muslin,&mdash;what
a hundred pities that it hung so well;
that her ribbons brought out the color in her
beautiful skin to such perfection; that the roses at
her belt were in such harmony with the ribbons,
the muslin, and the skin! She became a danger
to society, a flaming ship set loose amid peaceful
vessels moored at anchor. A dreary beacon, a
ship aground, beating and pounding on the bar, to
warn people where destruction lay,&mdash;this was
what she was to have been, in the anticipations of
Marrowfat. Poor Ph&oelig;be! she little knew how
dangerous to morals she was, as she turned over
the leaves of the strange Prayer-Book Lucy
handed her. Her heart thumped audibly against
her Jacqueminot roses. She felt all the family
despised her because she could not find her places;
she hoped Barry would not look till she got right
about the morning Psalms.</p>

<p>She had never seen people kneel down publicly
before. The very faithful in Brixton used to tip
their heads forward a little when the minister
made a prayer. The prayers at Brixton were
"oblique sermons," shied at heaven at an angle

<!-- page 135 -->

that made them equally available for instruction
and edification to the hearers below: perhaps that
was the reason the people tipped their heads a
little forward when the minister shut his eyes and
lifted his eyebrows and began what was called his
prayer; they did not want to be hit. Here everything
was new and strange. It would be saying
too much for Ph&oelig;be's intelligence and piety to
affirm that she was impressed by a ritual which
was presented to her for the first time, when there
was so much to agitate her in her surroundings.
The liturgy was pretty much lost upon her that
morning, but when the sermon began, she settled
herself to hear it with the feeling that now she
was <i>en pays de connaissance;</i> the firstly and secondly
were like old friends to her and quite restored
her composure. The text was, "And let
all the angels of God worship Him."</p>

<p>As a sermon, it was nothing very remarkable;
nothing beyond a plain and well-defined instruction
upon the subject of worship. The preacher
was not an orator, but he was an excellent thinker,
and never found any difficulty in getting you to
understand his thoughts. This sort of teaching
suited the young stranger; she listened eagerly.
It was a revelation to her to be told that she
did not go to church for any good it would do
her, nor even to set an example; but to pay to
Almighty God an act of service, a homage as unconnected
with these results as the sweeping of a

<!-- page 136 -->

room would be with the making of a batch of bread.
Everything was to be done to his glory, "as for
God's laws;" but this was especially a thing to
be done for that and that alone. It <i>would</i> bring
a blessing, it <i>would</i> do you good, as all duty done
honestly would do; but that was a secondary effect,
something given by the grace of God, not the
thing to be put forward as an object. If you
found, after years of church-going, that you were
not any sweeter-tempered for it, you must not
be any more discouraged than if you had been
learning Greek and did not find yourself any
farther ahead in mathematics because of it. Very
likely you would be able to get ahead much
farther for it because of the mental discipline,
but you would not expect it as a direct result, or
do it with that as a direct object. Greek is Greek,
mathematics are mathematics; worship is worship,
and not charity nor self-improvement. Your duty
to God as God is a distinct matter from your duty
to your neighbor and your duty to yourself.</p>

<p>The duty of public worship the preacher set
forth plainly as he saw it, bringing up the example
of the older dispensation, of our Blessed Lord,
of the Christian church from its earliest breath,
of the heavenly pattern, where before the throne
unendingly</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Faint mists of seraphs rise and fall."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>And he showed them, as he saw it (one cannot do
any more, and I suppose ought not to do any less),

<!-- page 137 -->

that the great act of Christian worship is paid in
the offering of the Holy Eucharist. He did not
pretend to understand the mysterious strength of
sacrificial service; in a certain sense, that is an
intellectual sense, nobody had ever understood it,
from Cain up to Kant. But, accepting faith as
a faculty distinct from reason, "believing that
he might understand, not understanding that he
might believe," he could see the meaning of the
chain of sacrifice, from the first sin in Eden to
the Great Oblation on Calvary; coming on from
thence to the last sin that shall offend the "most
worthy Judge eternal," extends the Christian sacrifice
"shown forth till He come," encircling the
ages in its mystic round. From Eden to Calvary,
from Calvary to Eden; the signet that clasps the
chain the Great White Throne set up in the new
heavens and the new earth.</p>

<p>The vacant plea of a memorial, a picture instead
of a presence, a talk about a thing instead of
the thing itself, had never satisfied Ph&oelig;be. She
was either too spiritual or not spiritual enough to
be contented with Protestant teaching on the subject
of the sacraments. It was an unexpected
comfort to her to find there was something she
could take hold of in the very misty sea of Christian
doctrine on which she had been drifting.</p>

<p>"If it means anything it must mean that," she
said, almost aloud. She had spent so much of her
life in listening to preachers engaged in rubbing

<!-- page 138 -->

out the meaning of Holy Writ, it was quite a
surprise to see one stand up and write it out in
strong lines afresh, and teach in effect if words
mean anything they mean what they express.
The belief in the supernatural had been so faintly
emphasized, so detached from all contact with the
natural, in the teaching to which she was used,
that logically she rejected it, being, as has been
said, too spiritual or not spiritual enough to abide
in such an impalpable kingdom. To such a mind
it was a great deal easier to follow the utmost
length of sacramental doctrine than to accept the
volatilized essence of a word as the point of union
between God and man. If you believe in the
supernatural at all, it is a great deal better to believe
in it as the Word of God and the Church
Catholic teach it than as you in your ethereal
daintiness might wish that it had been arranged.
"Except a man be born of water and the Holy
Spirit," "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
Man," "Whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained,"
are as easy to accept as "Ye are the
temples of the Holy Ghost," "This kind goeth
not out but by prayer and fasting," "Whatsoever
ye shall ask the Father in My name He will grant
you." Why reject what the Christian world for
fifteen hundred years agreed to believe as the supernatural
truth, while you accept a more sublimated
portion of the same faith on the same
terms? As against the scientists and hard dealers

<!-- page 139 -->

in facts you can have little or nothing to say;
you are not talking in the same language; but if
you have the happiness to believe anything that
God has revealed, why can't you believe it all,
and do Him the honor of submitting yourself to
Him unquestioningly?</p>

<p>These thoughts gave Ph&oelig;be a rapid sense of
satisfaction. She assimilated difficult truths with
the force of a young and healthy spirit.</p>

<p>When she went out of the church by Barry's
side, her heart no longer thumped against the Jacqueminot
roses. She was happily so engrossed
with her new and satisfactory basis of faith that
she did not see that nobody came forward to speak
to them, and that Barry strode out flushed and angry-looking;
for two or three people had looked
away when he caught their eyes, two or three
more he had seen whispering and looking at her,
and for once in their lives Honor and Lucy were
being permitted to walk home alone.</p>

<p>These and other little occurrences of the next
few days gave definite ground to Mrs. Crittenden
for believing that the current was setting against
them very strongly. It is hard to bear injustice
and insult for one's self, but I fancy no one will
deny it is harder to bear them for one's children.
Mrs. Crittenden could, perhaps, have nerved herself
to see Barry punished for his wrong-doing,
though it would have been a bitter sight. But
he had sinned. He had made his bed, and he

<!-- page 140 -->

must lie in it. He was working out his punishment,
and it might be the best thing for him that
it was sharp. It was a different thing when it
came to seeing Lucy and Honor neglected and tabooed.</p>

<p>Who does not know what a daughter's triumphs
are to a mother? One's own triumphs in youth
are half lost by the greedy inexperience that does
not know what a triumph is and when to be satisfied,
and by agitation of nerves and uncertainty of
judgment; it is generally more hazy than brilliant.
But with matured judgment, with calmed
nerves, with an egotistic pleasure refined from selfishness,
with romance stimulated by the prose of
one's own fate, with base calculation mixed with
purest sentiment, a woman watches the career of
her young daughter with a satisfaction that the
daughter misses. She feels no self-reproach at her
pleasure, no uncertainty as to the result, for such
love is always full of hope: it is the purest and
most unselfish romance of which a woman's heart
is capable. But turn the chances, and give her,
for success, failure. What compares with that for
sharp distress? The calmness of nerves is gone,
the mature judgment has quite failed her, the injustice
is a great deal more stinging than if she
had the inner consciousness of some desert, which
people always have when the injustice is personal.
The better woman she is the more she suffers; the
tenderer her heart, the livelier her imagination,

<!-- page 141 -->

the more unreasonable her sufferings. "These
sheep, what have they done?" What she could
have borne for herself with heroism, she fails to
bear for them with even passable dignity or patience.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">HONOR'S WOUNDS.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mamma</span>," said Honor, coming in from the
post-office one morning in late June, with her
hands full of letters and her cheeks flushed and
an angry light in her eyes, "I have something to
tell you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden had grown to dread what Honor
might have to tell her; she laid down her work,
and said "Well?" in a patient voice.</p>

<p>Lucy, who had been reading aloud, put her book
on her lap, and looked up too. They were sitting
on the piazza, which was covered with a tangle
of roses and honeysuckle, all in bloom. Honor
looked charmingly pretty in her simple muslin
dress and round hat. She threw down the letters,
of which there were quite a number, as if they
were of very little interest, and, sitting on the arm
of a piazza chair, began pulling off her gloves.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will believe me when I tell
you: the Meadow Club had their first meeting
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Lucy, quickly. "Why, <i>we</i>
got up the Meadow Club. I was thinking only

<!-- page 143 -->

this morning it was time we started it again for
the season. It's the fourth year now, you know,
and we always have to give it a start to begin;
but this year I really hadn't thought about it till
to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, you're saved the trouble, then. It's
started, and we are left out."</p>

<p>"How absurd, Honor! It doesn't seem self-respecting,
it doesn't seem quite nice, to think such
things possible," said her sister, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"It's less nice to have them happen," retorted
Honor, sharply, stretching out her gloves to their
greatest length in her two hands, and holding
them across her knee.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> isn't nice? Pray let us have your
woe," said Mrs. Crittenden, taking up her work
again, and trying to seem unmoved.</p>

"It isn't nice," cried Honor, with passionate
tears springing to her eyes, "to be left out of
everything, to be snubbed by everybody! This
morning, when I came out of the post-office, the
Merryhews' carriage stood there, and I went across
the sidewalk to speak to Fanny and Sue, who were
waiting in it. They seemed a little embarrassed,&mdash;I
didn't know why; but while we talked Fred
Warden came up and joined us, and in a moment
he said to me, 'Why weren't you at the Meadow
Club yesterday? There was such a large meeting,&mdash;everybody
was there. I looked around for
you.' At that Sue and Fanny colored up, and I

<!-- page 144 -->

saw Fanny give him a look, and he got so confused.
Then I said I didn't know there had been
a meeting, and Fanny said, Oh, it was quite informal; 
they didn't mean to have the Club very
large this year,&mdash;just among themselves. This
only seemed to make it worse, and Sue tried to
say something, in her stupid way; and I was so
blind with agitation that I couldn't look at any of
them. Then Fred went blundering on, and began
to ask if they were going to the Burleighs' to-night,
who it seems are to have a party, and what
time they were going, and how many would be
there. Everybody was going, they said, so glad
of something else to talk about; and then I got
away before they could ask me if <i>we</i> were going.
I think Fred wanted to walk home with me, but I
wouldn't look at him, I wouldn't let him come
near me. I hate him. I hate them all. I want
to go away from this horrid place. I won't, I
<i>won't</i> stay here any longer! Mamma, what do
they mean by treating us so? How dare they do
it? How <i>dare</i> they do it?"</p>

<p>And poor little Honor flung herself down on
the piazza floor beside her mother, and, burying
her face in her lap, sobbed passionately.</p>

<p>"You are tired with your hot walk," said her
mother, disengaging her hat with hands that trembled,
and smoothing back her hair. "It is too hot
for you to go for the letters in the morning now.
I will send one of the women."</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p>"I will never go again," sobbed Honor. "I
won't ever go out any more. I never want to see
a soul in Marrowfat as long as I live. I want to
go away. Oh, mamma, mamma, take us away!
What is the use of staying here to be snubbed&mdash;and
snubbed&mdash;like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my baby, that's a trifle," said her mother,
bending over her. "Why do you mind a thing
like that?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a trifle," cried Honor, "to be left out
of a club that you got up yourself, and not to be
invited to a general party at a house where you've
visited all your life! Lucy mayn't mind; she's
above such things, perhaps; but I <i>do</i> mind, and
they're not trifles to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Lucy looked as if she did mind, though; her
questioning eyes had been on her mother's ever
since Honor began her story, and her sensitive
face showed all the pain she felt.</p>

<p>"I don't understand what it means," she said,
falteringly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said her mother, still smoothing down
Honor's hair, "these are things that are happening
every day in the world. We have been fortunate
never to have had them come to us before.
Just do not think anything more about it. It
seems, as Lucy says, not self-respecting to care at
all for slights like these."</p>

<p>"But I can't help caring. I can't think about
anything else. I shall always be wondering what

<!-- page 146 -->

is coming next. It isn't as if it were a big place,
where you could get away from people; but it is
all or none here. You run up against people who
have been rude to you all the time. Everybody
knows whether you're invited or not, and everybody
watches you. Mamma, mamma, I wish you'd
go away."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure I gladly would," said her
mother, putting the girl's arms off her lap, and
rising to get the letters. "I am sure I gladly
would, to please you, if we had the money. We
haven't the money, and so we must stay and make
the best of it."</p>

<p>She took out her own letters from the package
and went away to read them, feeling she could not
bear a word more now.</p>

<p>She had a good deal of the same sort to bear as
the summer went on. The gayety was all in the
hands of a young set, who seemed to have no compassion
and no principle. Lucy and Honor were
as much excluded as if they were not living in the
place. The intimacies of years were undermined;
not of course in a moment, but one or two slights
brought coldnesses and misunderstandings, and
Honor was on the lookout for neglects. Tartar
was not there to fight the battle for them. She
was of too much social importance and had too
much force to have been ignored. But beyond
that little visit in the last of May they saw no
more of her all summer. Lucy was easily crushed,

<!-- page 147 -->

Honor was too young and hot-headed to make any
effectual resistance, and Mrs. Crittenden could
only submit to what had befallen her.</p>

<p>As for Barry, no one knew what he felt; with
all his genial ways, he was deeply reserved. He
worked early and late at the office, however, and
made his fatigue an excuse for the rather unconvivial
character of his conduct at home. Ph&oelig;be
probably did not know what was going on outside
the fence that bounded the Crittenden domain:
she could not be expected to guess that it was
something new that so few carriages came past
her humble door, and strange that so few people
took the opportunity of making her acquaintance.
Barry had agreed with her that it was best to dine
at home on most days, and she had a good deal to
do in making the dinners acceptable to his rather
fastidious taste. She had a great deal of sewing
to do, besides, and little as the house was it was
not a trifle to keep it in good order, with such a stupid
maid as Mary Ann, who could not even set a
chair back as she was told. That Barry was not
morose, that Tartar did not come again, that her
sisters-in-law did not pay her too many visits, that
her mother-in-law let her alone a good deal, and
that she had to see her father-in-law only once or
twice a week at dinner, were so many things to
be thankful for, and, added to her constant occupation,
good health, and her interest in thinking over
the new creed presented to her, made her, perhaps,

<!-- page 148 -->

the most contented member of the family group.
She eagerly imbibed the habits and manners of
those who surrounded her, and took good care to
copy the dress of her sisters with as much accuracy
as was possible with her purse. She went to
church quite regularly, whether Barry went or not,
looking dangerously handsome, but not at all conscious
of it, and much more interested in finding
the places in her new Prayer-Book and in digesting
the very strong teaching of her new faith. Once
or twice some friend of Barry's had walked home
with her when she was alone; but these friends
found so little coquetry combined with her beauty
that they were not encouraged to try it again.
They, however, did not cease to extol her attractions
before their families. Discussions about her
became, in fact, almost as much a part of the Marrowfat
Sunday dinner as the roast-beef itself. The
rest of the week was comparatively peaceful, as
she was rarely seen save on Sundays. The more
the fathers and husbands and brothers praised her,
the more the mothers and wives and sisters condemned
her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">A DAY IN TOWN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer, as to weather, proved very hot,
and no rain fell for many weeks. The vines dried
up around the piazzas of the big house and the
porch of the little one. The lawn grew crisp and
brown, and dust flew up in one's face as one walked
over it. The days were sultry and the nights oppressive.
The bread-winners came home fagged
from the city, and the eaters of bread at home received
them with spiritless languor. Honor and
Lucy missed their pony-phaeton and pony more
than ever when after sunset the carriages began
to appear, to catch the faint breezes on the road.
Mrs. Crittenden looked at her pitiful garden, and
thought almost bitterly of the faithful old Michael
who had been mowed down by the scythe of retrenchment,
now fighting the drought on the premises
of a prosperous neighbor. Mr. Crittenden
was more doggedly economical than ever, and more
unreasonably apprehensive that they were going
to total ruin. Small things and great seemed combined
to make the summer intolerable. But the
drought alone was fearful. One got a feeling at

<!-- page 150 -->

last that if it would only rain one would never
complain about anything else.</p>

<p>At last it did rain, lightly to be sure, in the
night. The air was a little cooled and the dust
laid and the sun faintly shaded by clouds when
people got up in the morning. They had so long
been doing nothing that the change inspired them
with plans. Those who had carriages ordered
them and went about to make visits and give invitations
and do errands; and the rest of the population
went to town to do the shopping that had
been so long neglected.</p>

Among these latter was Ph&oelig;be, who had only
been once or twice before, and to whom it was a
great event. The day proved a very delightful
one to her. They had gone in an early train, and
Barry had detailed a clerk from the office to show
her the way about the shops; she had made some
unequaled bargains, and had invested her small
capital most successfully. Then Barry had met
her at a restaurant, and they had taken luncheon
together. He had expanded, once out of the
smothering moral atmosphere of Marrowfat, and
the excursion had been really a little honeymoon.
The luncheon was the work of a much more advanced
artist than Mary Ann, and it was delightful
to the housekeeping soul of Ph&oelig;be to have
known nothing of its previous history, and to have
no responsibility about the disposition of its remains.
They sat by a window, where the air

<!-- page 151 -->

came in very pleasantly through tall coleus and
drac&aelig;nas and blossoming plants, which had not
been permitted to feel the drought that had withered
the greenery at home. The people about
them were all strangers; the little tables were
charmingly neat and well served; the waiters' obsequiousnesses
were as good as a play to the innocent
Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I have in mind, Ph&oelig;be,"
said Barry. "Another year we'll cut Marrowfat,
and come to town and be free. We'll take a little
flat somewhere, 'up in the sky, up in the sky,' and
get out of the way of people and do as we dern
please. When we want to be amused we'll go to
the theatre, and when we want to be convivial
we'll come here and get our dinner. It's only a
question of finance. Save your pennies up for
that, my dear."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not answer, but he saw by the shining
of her eyes that she was thrilled with pleasure
at the prospect. They went to look at some pictures
and into one or two shops that were shows
of magnificent unattainableness, and all the time
Barry talked of the flat, and of the happiness of
getting away from people and being where nobody
would know them. Ph&oelig;be told him how much
she thought they would have to pay for a servant,
and exactly what per diem would be needed for
the table. She asked questions about gas, and he
promised to inform himself. Rent was the great

<!-- page 152 -->

item, and the next day, he said, he would go to
some agents and find out. It seemed rather early
to canvass the matter, as they could not possibly
leave Marrowfat till the following spring, unless
the sky rained briefs and the flood of success softened
the father's heart. But the thought gave a
motive and a hope, and the two young people
walked the hot pavements with more buoyant
tread because of it.</p>

<p>They went back to Marrowfat in the afternoon
train, in which all the business men and shopping
women went back. With the sight of the
first familiar face came a shade over Barry's. He
bowed stiffly and carried Ph&oelig;be's parcels with a
less <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> air. On the ferry-boat, he took her
outside among the carmen and the nursery-maids,
hoping to escape contact with his townsmen. But
once on the train, they were surrounded by them.
Ph&oelig;be's inward blessedness added to her ordinary
beauty. She was not tired nor hot, as the other
shopping women were. Their presence did not
annoy her, because she did not know they were
Marrowfat people who had not called upon her.
One or two elderly gentlemen came up first, and
Barry not very graciously presented them. They
took the nearest seats, and talked to her a great
deal. Encouraged by the conduct of these heads
of families, the young men came up too, and before
the train reached Marrowfat they were standing
three deep around her seat, presenting what Mrs.

<!-- page 153 -->

Corbin, sitting alone with her bundles in the rear
of the car, characterized afterwards as "a disgusting
spectacle."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not know that Mrs. Corbin and
her bundles were there; she did not know it was
irregular for an Ex-Judge and an Ex-Commodore
to be talking to her, when Mrs. Ex-Judge and
Mrs. Ex-Commodore had not been to see her.
She only knew Barry and she had had a very
happy day together, and that down in her tightest-tied-up
bundle there was a tiny gown, all
lace and cambric and embroidery, that warmed
her very heart to think about. She talked naturally
and happily, but not very much, and she
looked most dangerously handsome. The Ex-gentlemen
shook Barry's hand warmly at parting:
upon their words, they thought to themselves, he
was not to be blamed. Their elderly compliments
had had as much effect upon Ph&oelig;be as elderly
compliments ordinarily have upon the average
young girl. They had made her a little uncomfortable,
and filled her with a vague wonder
whether these gentlemen knew how old they were,
and how grizzled and unpleasing. The young
men all seemed to her vastly below Barry, and
not nearly so nice as Peyton Edwards; but since
they were his friends, of course she must be as
well-mannered and amiable as she knew how to
be. When they got off the train the most persistent
of them carried her bundles, and led her to

<!-- page 154 -->

his dog-cart, before which were horses harnessed
tandem, and which was altogether the most conspicuous
seat she could have occupied. But when
she found that she would have to go alone, there
being no place for Barry, she declined, and went
away with Barry through the fast-dispersing multitude.</p>

<p>She did not consent to his proposal to take a
hack; had he not told her there was a motive for
which to save her pennies? But when they got
half-way up the hill, Barry looked so scowling
she regretted the economy. Crowds of carriages
were passing them; the rain of last night had all
evaporated, and they were powdered with dust
from the gay equipages, whose inmates looked out
with the fine scorn of luxurious comfort upon the
toiling pedestrians. Barry was loaded with bundles;
there was even a basket of peaches that
was materially heavy.</p>

<p>"Why in thunder didn't you give these things
to an expressman?" he said, impatiently.</p>

<p>"That would have cost as much as a hack,"
said Ph&oelig;be, simply.</p>

<p>"Bother the cost!" he said, trying to shift them
into less prominence. But bundles are bundles;
they are a mathematical fact, and not a chemical
combination, which by the heat of your furious
disgust you can resolve into more portable elements.
Assort and pack them as he would, they
still remained an ungainly armful.</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>"I can't think what you wanted of all these
things. Women are never happy unless they are
getting the house full of trash from shops. I wish
you'd only told me that you had such a lot of
parcels."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be looked hurt; she did not tell him that
the parcels had not increased in number since
they were in the city, but were identical with
those he had carried cheerfully for her there.
Mrs. Corbin, now in her comfortable carriage,
with her own bundles beside her on the seat,
thought them looking very far from happy as she
passed them.</p>

<p>"He is tired of her already," she ejaculated,
"and she is already spoiled by the flattery of those
unprincipled men."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corbin did not make a secret of these
discoveries; by noon the next day it was well
known in Marrowfat that Barry and his wife did
not live happily together.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch12">

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">LUCY HEARS THE STORY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> a later train that day, Mrs. Crittenden and
her two daughters had gone to town unpremeditatedly,
being tempted by the change in the
weather. They returned in the same train that
brought the others, and found themselves in the
rear of the same car, with a dozen people whom
they knew seated near them. After the exchange
of a few greetings, they were virtually quite as
much alone as if they had been on their own
piazza. The events of the last few months had
increased the coldness on both sides; it was as
difficult now to approach any of the Crittendens
as it had at first been to treat them with neglect.</p>

<p>Honor was tired with the day in town and a
little flushed with the heat, and possibly the contact
with so many of her former friends. She
certainly did not look as pretty as usual. Lucy
had a worn, unyouthful expression, which had
been growing lately on her face; it stung her
mother to see it. Looking bitterly at the two,
she did not wonder that, social reasons apart, the
young men preferred her daughter-in-law, at this

<!-- page 157 -->

moment, to her daughters. There is nothing so
successful as success. A good heartache from a
love affair, or a deep grief, sometimes adds depth
and pathos to beauty; but beware of care, disappointment,
chagrin, anxiety of the ordinary
kind, if you have control of a young girl's career.
There is nothing ages so fast and so surely.</p>

<p>Honor buried herself in a book, and did not
look up to receive the perfunctory salutations
of the gilded youth of Marrowfat who passed
through the car. Lucy saw them or not, as happened,
and returned them gravely and distantly.
No one stopped to talk to them. The circle round
Ph&oelig;be was too conspicuous not to attract the
notice of the most indifferent spectator. Mrs.
Crittenden saw the whispering heads of some matrons
in her neighborhood, and knew but too well
of what they whispered. Lucy's eyes met hers
once or twice in a troubled, questioning way.
Poor Lucy! <i>must</i> she know? Mrs. Crittenden
had fought bravely to keep her in the dark, but it
began to force itself upon her that this was no
longer right. Concealment is fatal to those "set in
families." When one member suffers, all the members
must suffer with it; bandages and ligaments
and all the muffling in the world will not keep the
secret of the wound from the rest of the body.
Lucy must suffer for Barry's sin, and she had better
do it intelligently than blindly. Her first contact
with evil of this sort would come cruelly near;

<!-- page 158 -->

but things must work themselves out. We cannot
pick and choose for our children, this trial now,
that chastisement a little later on, such and such
an experience by and by. The great wheel of
their lives has been set in motion by a higher
hand than ours, and we must patiently submit to
see its workings.</p>

<p>And so that night, as she sat alone in the
library, she called Lucy to her from the piazza.
The lamps had not been lighted. The slow, dull
heat had returned, the temporary freshness having
passed away with the effects of the short-lived
shower. The house was still, the air was stagnant;
the servants, even, sitting about the kitchen
steps in the rear, fanning themselves with their
aprons, had not the spirit to be noisy in their petulant
complainings. Lucy sat down beside her
mother and put her hand in hers. It was hard to
begin the story, but once begun it was an inexpressible
relief to the mother. She did not spare
anything, from the first hearing of the news to the
last feeling that she had had that day in the cars
when she had seen in such strong light the social
gulf that Barry's marriage had put between them
and their little world. And when she described
the harrowing doubts that had beset her lest she
had done wrong in using all her influence to effect
it, Lucy's quick breath and tightened grasp of her
hand as she whispered, "Mamma, how could you
ever have doubted?" lifted a weight from her

<!-- page 159 -->

heart. Lucy would help her bear this burden
that had seemed so intolerable. Lucy said few
words, and those very low-whispered ones; but
her mother felt the beating of her heart and the
hot trembling of her hand, and was thankful for
the darkness that hid the shame and pain in her
eyes. At last came the question that she dreaded:</p>

<p>"Mamma, do you think that he loved her, and
that he would have done it of himself?"</p>

<p>"That, Lucy, you know as much about as I
do. When the secrets of all hearts are revealed I
may know, but not before. I shall never get near
enough to Barry to ask him; he will never of his
own will approach anything so painful. Sometimes
I think he never could have left her, there
is so much to make her beloved; then, again, I
watch in vain for any sign of the lover. I appeal
in vain to my knowledge of human nature. Barry
is a sealed book to me in these days. I don't
know whether he is one of those men to whom
love is impossible without respect, or whether the
tenderness of his early passion would cover the
frailty of virtue that to most men is unpardonable.
All experience is against the probability of a
man's valuing what is forced upon him. And yet
he had an alternative; he was not forced into it.
It was made possible for him to go away. On the
other hand, did he do it from duty,&mdash;from the
sort of conviction that you and I have, Lucy?
Your father would tell me that such a view of

<!-- page 160 -->

duty is just a woman's notion: and we have never
thought Barry likely to take a woman's view of
duty; happy if he took a man's! No, my child,
it's all a riddle to me. I can only watch with a
sore heart the working out of what with perhaps
rash assurance I at first said was the right thing
to do. Your father is against me in it, and every
day hardens his convictions and weakens mine. I
have put it out of my power to win Ph&oelig;be's
confidence, by my unhappy failure of charity
when her wretched mother came to me. I am her
enemy, and I am not Barry's friend, apparently.
I have spoiled life for you and Honor, and the
courage of my convictions seems to have left me
just when I needed it most. You must help me,
Lucy,&mdash;help me, and forgive me if I have done
you and Honor harm. God knows nobody ever
meant to do right more earnestly. I thought I
knew what it would cost."</p>

<p>"And if you had known, mamma, you would
have done it. If you had it to do to-morrow you
would do it again. I shall never think that you
<i>could</i> do anything else."</p>

<p>And so Lucy helped bear the bitter load. A
new light came into her eyes, and the worn, anxious
look left her face. She had a mission, to help
Barry, to soothe Honor, and above all to aid her
mother to bear courageously the penalty of doing
right. Perhaps no discipline could have been as
good for her as this was. It gave play to all her

<!-- page 161 -->

virtues, self-sacrifice, tenderness, high conception
of duty, while it corrected some of her mistaken
enthusiasms, and supplied her with the wholesome
though bitter tonic of practical common sense.</p>

<p>After all, parents do not always know what is
good for their children, and it is just as necessary
to submit in an humble spirit to their children's
discipline as to their own.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 162 -->

<div class="center" id="ch13">

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">LEFT BEHIND.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was February; damp snow below, wet fog
above. Little rivers ran parallel with the sidewalks,
where there rose little mountain-chains of
snow banks, as yet undigested by the thaw. The
air was full of splash and drip, and a smell of moist
wood and moist earth and moist everything. The
country was at its most unlovely point, the "awkward
age" of the year. The "getting about"
was so bad that nobody got about. The Crittendens'
door-bell did not ring once a day. But
some changes had taken place in the household since
the August drought. The cottage was shut up,
and the third floor was now the home of Barry and
his wife and the little boy who had been born to
them in December. The draughts, and the leaks,
and the necessity for stoves made the cottage a
more desirable residence for gardeners than for
gentle-folks. Ph&oelig;be had consented for the baby's
sake to give up her own will, and Barry found
himself so fretted by the discomforts of the little
shanty that he would have made a much more decided
abdication of independence than this without
complaint.</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>Virtue was its own reward, however. Shortly
after the change had been made another was determined
on. The successful termination of one
or two important suits gave Mr. Crittenden an
impression that he was not nearly so poor as he
had thought himself all summer. A good deal of
money in his hand is apt to change the views of
even the most prudent man. No doubt Mr. Crittenden
ought to have invested it all in government
bonds, and gone on in his path of retrenchment unmoved.
But instead he considered that his girls
had had a very dull summer and that seven o'clock
came much too early for comfort at this season,
and he proceeded to find them a charming and not
inexpensive suite of rooms in town, whither with
much dispatch and some rejoicing they went for
the winter, leaving Barry and Ph&oelig;be to keep
house alone.</p>

<p>This was delightful, and Ph&oelig;be was most happy
till the fogs and the snows and the thaws seemed
to make it a necessity for her husband to spend
two or three nights in every week with them in
town. Barry's spirits improved very much about
this time. These little tastes of town invigorated
him. He appeared to have thrown off the incubus
of Marrowfat condemnation. His sisters were
enjoying themselves, Tartar was constantly with
them, the atmosphere was a fresh one, his ready
popularity made him happy again. People are not
critical in a large city; they want to be amused,

<!-- page 164 -->

and they do not ask questions. Barry was unencumbered;
he was "small change" for dinner
parties; he was always in demand; he had so many
invitations that he had a feeling of great virtue
when he waded through the slush every other
night, on his way home to his wife and baby.</p>

<p>"It isn't every man would do this," he would
say to himself as he kicked the snow off his boots
at the door, on some dismal nights when it was
pitch dark at six o'clock. Yet he liked to do it;
he liked to feel he was doing better than most men
would do. He was not bitter about it; he was
quite cheerful. He enjoyed the baby; the house,
when he got to it through the slush and fog, was
quite as delightful as any city house could be,
his little dinners were above criticism, and his
wife always handsome and not reproachful. If it
had not been for the importunity of the givers of
dinners and the getters-up of theatre-parties it is
quite possible he would have come home every
night without feeling bored. Still it did heighten
his spirits to taste the wine of social pleasure
again; it did please him to be desired and approved.</p>

<p>A most absorbing interest, too, arose at this
time. Somebody got up some theatricals, and
found the Crittendens useful. Honor was delighted
to be asked to play, and Barry was
"roped in," according to his own account very
much against his will, but he did not seem to

<!-- page 165 -->

make great struggles to get free. The rehearsals
were endless; every page of the three-act drama
must have consumed about a week of time, if
everybody's studying, rehearsing, costuming, consulting,
journeying, were summed up accurately
together. Barry professed great disgust of the
whole thing before it was over. "If he were ever
caught in such a scrape again!" But he did not
seem to think he could be excused from anything,
not even one of the three suppers which succeeded
the final and not very triumphant representation
of the play. Ph&oelig;be ought to have admired his
sense of duty very much. "When you've once
undertaken a thing you've got to see it through."</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the days were very
long and the nights very dark to the young wife
left at home. But she had her baby, she was
very busy, and she was not inclined to dwell upon
the thought that she was ill-used.</p>

<p>At last, however, there came a day so dark that
it made all these look light, when she recalled
them. Barry had come home looking unusually
animated and eager. She had a feeling that something
had happened to rouse him beyond the ordinary.
She longed rather apprehensively to know
what it was, and wished that she had the ability
to say plainly to him, What is it that has excited
you so much?</p>

<p>Evidently he had made up his mind not to reveal
his matter till after dinner. He caressed the

<!-- page 166 -->

baby with unusual fervor, he praised the dinner
freely; there was compunction with his fervor,
surely. Ph&oelig;be's appetite faltered fatally; what
was coming to explain his mood? At last it
came, after the dinner had been taken away, and
the baby, and they were sitting alone by the
library fire.</p>

<p>"What should you say, Ph&oelig;be, if I went away
for a little while? Could Master Baby take care
of you for a matter of six weeks or two months?
He looks to me capable of it. Let me tell you all
about it. We've had a certain turn of things at
the office. These railroad matters have occupied
my father pretty closely, and a telegram yesterday
settled it that he's got to go across. Then came
the worry about leaving my mother and the girls.
Going abroad is what they've all been longing
for, for years,&mdash;here was the chance. Mamma
had a thousand minds about it, but Honor only
one, and I believe Lucy was 'unanimous!' So
the fact is, I've been racing over town all day
like mad, have arranged everything: given up
their apartments, got state-rooms, written letters,
settled matters at the office, and done the work of
twenty able-bodied men. Father growls, but I
think he likes the idea, and there isn't a doubt
but that the change will do them all good. They
had got in a rut, and the girls would have a beast
of a time this summer if they stayed at home."</p>

<p>"But you," said Ph&oelig;be, faintly,&mdash;"I don't
understand."</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>"Oh, well, I hadn't got there yet. You see
this is the way it stands. If I don't go with them
my father's got to come back at once. If I go I
can take the first steamer home after it's settled,
bring back the papers, and attend to the matter
at this end of the line, and leave him to a holiday
of several months. There is enough there to require
his attention and to give him a feeling that
he's right to stay; in fact, if he didn't stay I'd
have to. Somebody's got to be on hand there as
well as here. You see, it's an important matter,
and we have just got to give up our individual interests,
and take hold of it. I don't like to ask
you, Ph&oelig;be, to stay so long alone, but I don't see
how it can be helped. I've thought it over on all
sides. It seems the best arrangement I can make.
Father needs the rest. It would be hard on him,
at his age, to make that voyage and come directly
back, and probably have to go again in six weeks'
time. Whereas if I go with him, get all the ins
and outs of the matter the little while I'm there,
and come back, I can intelligently conduct the
case here, and bring things to a successful issue.
There's a good deal of money in it and a good
deal of glory, and I like to feel my father trusts
me enough to leave things on this side to me. It's
just the place where, if I hung back on the score
of leaving you, he could reproach me with my
marriage. I've counted on you, Ph&oelig;be, to help
me, and I know you won't mind, for such a little
while."</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>Such a little while! If one night was long, what
would sixty be. A terrible sinking of the heart
made Ph&oelig;be's lips white, but she managed to say,
"I can see that it is best for you to go."</p>

<p>"That's right," he said, stooping down and kissing
her. "I knew you'd look at it in that way.
I don't mind telling you now that my mother opposes
it, and thinks I ought not to leave you alone,
with the baby so young and all that. I told her I
would put it before you, and if you didn't think
it best there should not be a word more said about
it. But I shall be proud to tell them you're not
the woman to stand in the way of your husband's
business interests."</p>

"And private pleasures," said a voice within
her. Her heart had grown so stony heavy it
did not seem that it could sink any lower. That
he was going would have been bad enough, but
that he was going with such spirit, with such ill-concealed
pleasure in the change of scene and
prospect of amusement, made it almost more than
she could bear. Once having got over the bad
business of telling her of it, his relief made him
more communicative than his usual habit. He
drew upon her sympathy in all his plans; he expected
her to see how great the advantage to him
was, how much he would gain by the experience.
All the details of preparation were delightful to
him, and he seemed to think they would naturally
be the same to her. He was the sort of man who

<!-- page 169 -->

makes a good traveler, loving travel, being systematic,
observant, self-reliant. He had never
had enough of it, and had resented that part of
his fate always, and in other days been inclined to
reproach his parents with not giving him a year
abroad before settling him down at the study of
the law.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was not unreasonable: she repeated
these facts over to herself; she added to them
that he had been working hard for several
months; that he was stimulated by the prospect
of pleasing his father and showing himself a man
in business matters. He was going with his family,
too, who were in every way agreeable and
companionable. It was but for a short time, as
the world counts time. She was safe, well provided
for; the baby was perfectly healthy. It
was in no way an unjustifiable request that she
should stay contented at home while he went
abroad on a legitimate call of business. It was
not unjustifiable, but oh!&mdash;</p>

<p>Your inarticulate natures have a good deal to
bear in the way of imposed attributes. If a woman
does not say she is unhappy, it is so much more
comfortable to think she is happy, that those near
her get in the habit of concluding that she is;
if she does not scold, that she does not mind; if
she does not draw a dagger, that she is not jealous;
if she does not complain, that she is satisfied with
what is being done; if she listens silently, that

<!-- page 170 -->

she is wholly sympathetic. Now Ph&oelig;be found it
not the least of her trials that she was talked to as
if she were his elder sister, or his aunt, or almost
his mother, by this eager youth on the threshold
of his adventure in the world. And not only by
him, but by the others, who came home for their
last day and night, to settle up matters for their
absence.</p>

<p>"Isn't it nice for Barry?" whispered Lucy,
counting on her sympathy.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Barry look like a prince in his new
ulster?" cried Honor. "Ph&oelig;be, you won't mind
if we don't tell people that he's married!"</p>

<p>"If Barry keeps his mind on his business, he
may make something yet," said her father-in-law
to her as he went in to dinner. As he rarely said
anything to her, she concluded it was meant to
indicate he approved of her for not putting any
thing in the way of Barry's going. Only her
mother-in-law was silent and watched her narrowly.
"You are a little pale," she said, when
they were alone in the nursery.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ph&oelig;be, with a rush of crimson
to her face.</p>

<p>"You mustn't let the baby keep you awake at
night," said the mother, with foreboding, seeing
where the wound was, and that she could not
offer sympathy. "Let Mary Ann take him, if he
bothers you at night. You know young mothers
<i>must</i> get sleep enough."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>It was a very bright-shining day, that last day
at home. The sun shone with brilliant effect
on the fresh snow that had fallen the night before.
The sky was unnaturally blue, it seemed to
Ph&oelig;be. It hurt her eyes to look out of the window.
Sleigh-bells sounded from the road with a
jingle that fretted her nerves. They were all to
go in a late afternoon train; their steamer sailed
the next morning. It had at first been planned
that Barry should stay at home, and follow them
in an early morning train. But some doubt arose
about somebody being seen at the office, whom
Mr. Crittenden did not think he would have time
to see if he had the charge of the family's getting
off. So it was decided Barry should go with
them and spend the night in town.</p>

<p>This decision was arrived at just before they
sat down to their early dinner. It was not an uncheerful
meal. Honor's spirits were wild. Lucy
was quiet, but probably happy. Barry was too
busy to be depressed; every few moments he
thought of something to tell Ph&oelig;be, which he
had forgotten. The father and mother were full
of care and plans, but the journey was a hopeful
one; they took all their dearest with them; for
them there was no parting. The sunshine gave a
stimulus to their spirits; the evergreens outside
the windows were sparkling like so many mammoth
aigrettes; the hills were white against the
brilliant sky of blue. They were all hungry and

<!-- page 172 -->

healthy and hopeful&mdash;and going. Ph&oelig;be alone
was heavy-hearted and unhungry and to be left
behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," cried Honor, "what have
you done about Aunt David's state-room, Barry?
Has she made up her mind to submit to the extortion,
or does she take the other one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Barry, absently,&mdash;he was
making an addition to his already endless memoranda,
writing on the table between his plate and
Ph&oelig;be's,&mdash;"that's all settled. Don't bother me,
Honor, till I get these things written down."</p>

<p>"Just think, Ph&oelig;be," said Lucy, "of Aunt
David's consenting to go at four days' notice!
She is like a girl in her spirit and energy. She
will be the youngest of the party, I am sure.
Wasn't it hard upon her, though, to break up
her winter quarters, and go off on a sea voyage
in midwinter! But she can't deny Tartar anything."</p>

<p>"Tartar would have gone without her, if she
hadn't consented," cried Honor. "She has just
followed because she didn't want to be left behind.
No great credit in that. Nobody wants to
be left behind!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden's eyes involuntarily sought
Ph&oelig;be's face: it was so white she almost made
the blunder of starting up to go to her. But
Ph&oelig;be had not looked up and had not seen her
solicitude. She sat still, her eyes cast down, her

<!-- page 173 -->

agitation showing itself only by the pallor of her
face and the deep breaths she drew. It showed
itself, however, only to those who looked, and nobody
looked but Mrs. Crittenden. The rest were
all so busy.</p>

<p>It was rather an irregular meal, Barry leaving
the table two or three times to look after last
things, and Honor dancing to the sideboard more
than once to supply the place of the maid, who
had been sent up-stairs for something suddenly
remembered.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrid old Marrowfat; how glad I am to
be going away from it!" she cried, starting up
as her father left the table.</p>

<p>The next hour was a very busy one. The last
things to be put in the valises, the last orders to
be given to the servants; expressmen, hackmen,
next summer's gardener; a real-estate agent to
know if the place would possibly be in the market,
a man with a forgotten bill of butter eaten
six months ago; the reporter of the "Chronicle"
to write up a local item; a laundress who wanted
a recommendation; a poor man whose family had
developed pneumonia; the carpenter to see about
the parlor shutters; the locksmith to tighten the
hasps of one of the steamer trunks. It was a
racking pressure; the afternoon sun was sinking,
the brilliance fading from the snow, when the
hour for starting came.</p>

<p>"Come," cried Mr. Crittenden, impatiently

<!-- page 174 -->

(every one was at the end of his or her patience),
"there is no time to be lost if we catch the train.
The sleigh is at the door."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be stood half-way down the stairs on the
landing-place, with the baby in her arms. Barry
was up-stairs, the rest were below. The girls ran
up and kissed her good-by, and caressed the
placid baby. It was the instinct, probably, of not
taking the baby too near the outer door, where the
cold air rushed in, that made her stand there and
allow her father-in-law to come up and give her
his cold kiss and a half mocking good-by to the
little heap of white cambric in her arms, but she
did not say so, or explain herself. She went down
a step to meet her mother, whose kiss was not
cold, and who whispered in her ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-by, I will take care of him for you."</p>

<p>Then she had some right in him! But she did
not answer. They might as well have been saying
good-by to a statue on the landing-place. They
hurried out and into the sleigh, and the horses
shook their bells restlessly, but still Barry had not
come. His father called out for him impatiently,
almost angrily; the hall door stood ajar, and the
icy current of air was forcing itself into the hall.
Ph&oelig;be stood instinctively holding the baby's
head against her shoulder with her hand, but she
was not thinking about it much. She was listening
for Barry's step above, and hearing his father's
voice below. There was indeed not a moment to
lose.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>"Yes, I'm coming!" he called out from the upper
floor, and he came down hurriedly. "Ph&oelig;be,
you'll have to see to the locking of my desk; I
can't get the key out. Confound the hurry! It
all comes of going so many hours before I had
arranged to."</p>

<p>A sense of suffocation came over Ph&oelig;be as his
step reached the stair on which she stood; a
crowding of too much into a space that would not
hold it.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said, taking her in his arms and
kissing the baby and her alternately. "Good-by,
good-by."</p>

<p>He held her closely, and she clung against him,
going down step by step, till they reached the hall.
Her lips moved, but she could hardly make him
understand the only words she could speak:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't forget&mdash;baby."</p>

<p>He laughed lightly. "And how about you?"
he said, giving her a final fervent kiss at the door,
as his father called him harshly from outside. He
had laughed lightly. Barry would laugh so when
he stepped into the boat to cross the Styx; but
his face had been pale and his kiss fervent. He
pulled the door shut after him; it closed with a
heavy noise. Ph&oelig;be, staggering against it, leaned
listening till the sleigh-bells passed out of hearing
into the road, and were lost. Then, with a low
cry that it is to be hoped the servants did not
hear, she caught the baby against her breast, went

<!-- page 176 -->

flying up the stairs to her own room, locked the
door, and, panting, put the child into its cradle,
flung herself upon the floor beside it, and burying
her face in the soft blankets rocked backward and
forward in her oppressive anguish. She fought
her battle alone; the baby went to sleep, rocked
by her sorrow as he had been borne by her pain,
and equally unconscious. The servants gathered
together below, and chattered over the going in
the idle twilight.</p>

<p>And in the fast-rattling train, Barry no doubt
got over his pallor and his fervor, and possibly
even the mother's foreboding heart grew lighter.
It is so much easier to go than to stay, to be active
than passive, to be a man than to be a woman.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">ISOLATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all, to a reasonable being in fair health
there are few troubles that are unbearable. That
first night was bad enough, and the second little
better; but soon the sorrow settled down into a
habit, and was worn accordingly, and not taken
into the hand and inspected hourly. Then she
resolved stoutly to make the best of it, and not to
hurt the baby by fretting. Making the best of it
involved keeping herself busy and scrupulously
attending to every smallest duty of the household.
Things had been left entirely to her discretion as
to the housekeeping. She had been told to keep
as many of the servants as she chose; to use whatever
rooms she liked; to act, in effect, exactly as
if the house were hers.</p>

<p>On the third day after they had gone she roused
herself to look into the situation and make her
plans. It pleased her to feel she was doing discreetly
with the matters left in her charge. She
was saving money, if the rest were spending it.
Barry's baby had a right to a home; she was
merely staying in it to take care of him. If there

<!-- page 178 -->

was a touch of bitterness in these reflections, they
gave her the nerve she might have lacked to dismiss
the unnecessary servants and place things on
an economical footing. The cook was reduced to
a general servant, and Mary Ann kept for the
baby's nurse. All the best bedrooms were shut
up, except the two on the third story which had always
been Barry's. The parlors were cleaned and
clothed in their drab coverings and locked; the
dining-room alone was open. The furnace was
put on half rations; the butcher and grocer were
made to understand that the family was almost
extinct; the gas-bill was nearly nominal. All these
changes were not effected without effort: but your
true reformer is he who has not much to lose, and
who "sits loose to the world," as the pious old
books say. A dash of recklessness helps one
through some trying domestic situations wonderfully.
The whole matter seemed trivial and unimportant
to Ph&oelig;be, aching with her real sorrows,
and she carried it through with so high a hand
that it was necessarily successful. The most vital
element in the management of servants is not to
be afraid of them. Ph&oelig;be did not care in the
least whether Mary Ann stayed or went, or
whether the cook resented her reduction or not;
she had at heart almost a feeling that it would be
agreeable to her if they all went away, and left
her and baby alone in the third-story room,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Rolled in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 179 -->

<p>She rather invited anarchy: she was in a mood to
have welcomed change. And so the cook meekly
took her increased work and decreased pay, and
Mary Ann made herself agreeable to the baby
and filled many minor offices in the house without
a murmur, and the butcher and grocer were as
respectful as when the bills were huge. Whether
this was the perversity of fate or the perversity
of human nature out at service is not quite clear.
At all events, it was so, and Ph&oelig;be's days, once
started, rolled on without household change or
friction.</p>

<p>She never went out except to take an occasional
walk on the loneliest road she could find, or to go
to church. Often the baby made it impossible to
go to church; she never felt easy to leave him so
long with the flighty Mary Ann, but she never
stayed away without a fretted feeling. She had
given up hoping that any one would help her and
hold out a hand to her in the path of faith to
which she was drawn. They were evidently not
a proselyting people, these people to whom her instincts
were leading her to join herself. One day
her baby had been taken to church and brought
to "the illumination of baptism, with God's grace
preventing his election, and by an artificial necessity
and holy prevention engaged to the profession
and practices of Christianity." She had had such
deep thoughts they might almost have forced their
way out into words. But when the service was

<!-- page 180 -->

over and they were coming away, the clergyman
had shaken hands with her cordially and commonplacely,
and had said they had a fine child, and
that he had behaved remarkably well. His words
and manner were somewhat unsacerdotal, though
sufficiently civil. It would be difficult to know
what she had thought he ought to say or do, but
he certainly had not done it, whatever it was.
And from that day she grew dumber than ever,
and knew she could never speak to <i>him</i>. And to
whom could she speak? Between her mother-in-law
and herself there was a gulf fixed; Lucy was
a little afraid of her, and never knew exactly what
to say to her on any subject; and to Barry nobody
would ever think of talking about such things.
So, one by one, the chances had slipped away from
her, till she had been left in material as well as
fancied isolation.</p>

<p>Living "in a corner of a wide house" is necessarily
dreary living. The stairs resound so when
you go up them at night, the doors slam with
such an echo, the winds blow with such insinuations,
the blinds have so much to say, the nightly
solitude is so peopled with suggestions. The light
from Ph&oelig;be's room shone across the snow very
late at night sometimes. But the baby's good
condition showed that she was not fretting unreasonably,
and if she sat up late it was to sew for
him, or to write letters to her husband, or to read
some book that took her thoughts away from her

<!-- page 181 -->

own trouble. No young wife could have behaved
better than she did; and if the two months were
long in passing, they did pass at last, and she
found herself in possession of a letter that told
her, when this came into her hands her husband
would be half-way across the ocean on his way
home.</p>

<p>Barry was not a fluent letter-writer. He said
very little generally, and did not say that little
with an air of voluntariness. One had a feeling
he was writing up his books, doing what had to
be done, getting square with his conscience. But
it was his characteristic, and Ph&oelig;be had steeled
herself against being hurt by it. His sisters always
joked about his dispatches, and she knew
she had no more to complain of than his family
had had for years. This letter, however, that told
of his coming home had a few unusual words in
it that gave her a thrill of joy. It was better
than all the diffuseness of other people. This he
must really mean, or why should he have said it?
He was surely glad that he was coming back to
her, no matter what or who he left behind him.</p>

<p>The letters of the others had naturally had
many stings in them, notably Honor's, who, happily
for her sister-in-law's peace of mind, did not
find time to write very often. Tartar occupied a
very prominent place in Honor's occasional letters,
and Barry's good spirits and great popularity
were strongly dwelt upon.</p>

<!-- page 182 -->

<p>"You mustn't mind if he comes back to you a
little spoiled," she wrote, "for between mamma's
and Lucy's coddling and Tartar's cousinly devotion
he is made entirely too much of at home, and
when we go out it is positively revolting. You'd
think the women here (in Nice) had never seen a
man worth looking at before."</p>

<p>Lucy's letters and her mother's were so devoid
of such observations, and so full of soothing sentences
about dear Barry's natural anxiety to be at
home, that she distrusted them entirely, and found
them much worse than Honor's naive truth. But
here he was, almost back again: three days more,
and she could see for herself how spoiled he was,
or how glad to be beside her.</p>

<p>It was not till she knew that he was away from
Tartar that she realized how great and how constant
the strain had been of knowing that they
were together; she had been fighting the thought
all the time, and resisting the impulse to imagine
scenes and incidents that were torture to her.
But now she had fought her battle, and she knew
she had fought it well, and the sense of victory
over herself and of a truce with fate was very
soothing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">A DIDO OF TO-DAY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a stormy day in early April, the day
after Barry's letter had come heralding his return.
The little household was in busy flutter. Two
women were undressing the parlor chairs and sofas,
and washing the windows, notwithstanding
the persistent splashing of raindrops on them.
Mary Ann was busy below in some unusual work
resulting from the great occasion. Ph&oelig;be, in a
state of keen, expectant happiness, was "minding"
the baby in the little room always called
Barry's study, adjoining their bedchamber, on the
third floor. It was a pretty little corner room,
with two windows, an open fire, an aesthetic mantel,
and some nice engravings. It had never been
much altered since Barry's bachelor days, and
nothing ever spoke to his mother's heart of the
past as did this place. To Ph&oelig;be this association
had not been pleasant, of course, but she
rigorously forbore to ask questions or to propose
changes. She did not know why that picture had
the knot of faded pink ribbon tied above the cord,
nor why those two pipes crossed over the desk

<!-- page 184 -->

must not be taken down, nor the particular value
of that wisp of dried grass in the Copeland vase
in the corner. She had endured the sight of these
inanimate incentives to jealousy all through the
lonely winter. Now she quite defied them, and
felt as she dusted them that familiarity had robbed
them of their sting. Nothing, it seemed to her,
could sting her to-day, she was so content. She
felt she had earned her peace. She knew she had
behaved well: she looked over the battle-field and
felt it had been a sharply-contested fight.</p>

<p>The rain outside and the peevish spits of snow
that occasionally mingled with it did not depress
her. She looked about the room, and put it, in
imagination, in the order in which it was to be on
Thursday. In the good weather which was sure
to come to-morrow it was to be swept and cleaned,
and the windows were to shine like crystal. Mary
Ann should spend two hours on the brasses of the
fire-place, and she with her own hands would lay
the fire that would blaze up in his welcome.
There should be flowers in those glasses and
fresh ribbons for the curtains; and baby should
lie there in his berceaunette with his prettiest
blanket over him. It was a pity it rained so to-day,
and she could do so little. At any rate, she
could put the closet and shelves in order and rearrange
the books in the little book-case in the
corner.</p>

<p>This took all too short a time, and still the baby

<!-- page 185 -->

slept. Many times she went over to him, and
touched the swinging cradle with a light hand,
and moved a blanket this way or that, and gazed
fondly at him, and went back to her work. It was
a very hard part of her discipline that when she
was disturbed about her husband she loved her
baby less rather than more. Instead of clinging
to him and finding comfort in him she felt her
heart turned hard to every one, even him, and only
held him by an instinct that seemed no higher
than that of self-preservation. She looked at him
with cold eyes when her heart was hot with jealousy;
she cared for him with perfunctory hands
when her mind was filled with forebodings and
distress. But to-day she was happy in the sight
of his beauty and health. She began to feel that
he would be a bond to bind her husband to her.
They two could unite in love and interest and effort
for this child, who belonged almost equally to
both. She felt for perhaps the first time as most
ordinarily happy mothers feel always about their
first-born children.</p>

<p>Her instinct, however, was not to muse and
brood over joy or sorrow. So after a few minutes
given to these thoughts, leaning over the cradle,
she lifted herself up, and said, "What shall I do
towards getting ready for Thursday?"</p>

<p>Her eye fell upon the desk that stood beside
the window. She remembered the circumstance
of the key refusing to turn in the lock the day

<!-- page 186 -->

her husband went away, and that she had noticed,
when she had shut it up and locked it, that it was
in great disorder. She had never looked into it
before or since. Barry had always carried the
key in his pocket, and it was no doubt owing to
the obstinacy of the lock that day that it was not
there now. At another time she would have
thought of this, and reflected that she might better
not look into what had never been offered for
her inspection. But she was too happy to-day to
have such thoughts. It was something she could
do for him. It was impossible to be doing anything
with any other motive. Whatever she did,
even down to her little cares for baby, was in
directly done with the feeling that it was for him,
for his child, who represented him. So very
light-heartedly she went to fetch the key and unlock
the dusty desk.</p>

<p>The key was cranky again, but her fingers were
strong and her intention was deliberate. In a few
moments it turned and the doors opened. Oh,
what an untidy place! Ph&oelig;be loved order and
neatness and thrift, but she thought it rather a
manly attribute to be regardless of all these.
She laughed softly to herself as she said, "Oh,
Barry, this is just like you!" There were keys
and pipes, cigars and visiting-cards, note paper
and wrapping paper, bills and family letters,
cheek by jowl in the most <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> manner. The
shelves were literally heaped with such elegant

<!-- page 187 -->

trifles, the pigeon-holes stuffed with papers which
were doubtless as incongruous. She cleared the
shelves first, wiping and dusting them very carefully,
and arranged the contents with some regard
to fitness of companionship. Evidently the desk
had not been emptied for a couple of years.
There were letters and bills as old as that, and
one knows what an accumulation of such things
can be acquired in two years. She assorted the
letters and filed the bills. Happily the bills were
receipted, and the letters were mostly from men,
or in the handwriting of his sisters and mother.
She did not read the letters, of course, but tied
them up in decent order, bundle by bundle, as she
did her own. When this was all done she put
them back neatly in piles as they belonged. The
shelves did not look half full; it was a pleasure
to see what a little order would do. Barry would
know where to lay his hand on everything. In
future she would ask him to let her have his keys
and keep things in place for him. What comfort,
what a saving of time and temper, it would be!
He would have had ten minutes more for his good-by
to her if he had not got embroiled with this
disordered desk the day he went away.</p>

<p>Baby moved a little uneasily. She left the contemplation
of the well-ordered shelves and went
to him. He did not wake, only turned and fretted
for a moment; then twisting his head down on the
pillow, and moving his lips in the imaginary bliss

<!-- page 188 -->

of nursing, sank again into repose. He was a
beautiful child, inheriting apparently all the magnificent
health of his father and mother. He had
a full but delicate mouth, chestnut hair that lay
in soft rings upon his forehead, lustrous eyes and
wonderful lashes, and a fine creamy skin with
warm tints. There was a little moisture on the
chestnut rings, and she turned back the blanket.
She lifted the pink hand: the fingers closed
around one of hers; it was like undoing the tendrils
of a vine to get them loosened without waking
him. So! She laid the rose-tipped hand back
and stooped down and kissed it lightly, and then
with a half sigh turned again to her work.</p>

<p>But first she put a stick of wood on the fire;
then she looked out at the unseasonable storm,
which was turning to hail at the moment, and
wondered if the invisible buds on the trees below
the window would be chilled to death by it, and
whether "the wonders under-ground," the up-starting,
up-pushing forces of the spring, would
be put back by it. It was hard to fancy the sun
shining to-morrow, but it would shine; and on
Thursday it would be spring.</p>

<p>And then she went practically to her work.
Any one who has ever cleared out a man's desk
with a tenderness for the man who owned it can
understand the charity with which she collected
overturned boxes of new pens from among the litter
of old ones, and the care with which she discriminated

<!-- page 189 -->

between time-tables two years old and
those of recent date. All memoranda in his hand
writing were sacred. She was a good deal in awe
of everything that looked like business papers.
Here was a crumpled slip of legal cap with mystic
words like these upon it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"3 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 140; 5 C. &amp; P. 23.
See Tidd."</p>

<p>She lifted it with care. What might not depend
upon it? Baby's inheritance to the extent
of thousands might be damaged by its loss.</p>

<p>But here was something that did not look like&mdash;business.
It was put away in one of the upper
pigeon-holes of the desk, far back. She could
not remember whether, when she first opened the
desk, she had taken away anything from before
it. She rather thought not. It was an envelope,
and it contained a paper. On the face of the envelope
Barry's initials were written, and in the
corner at the left, "February 2, 188&mdash;." It was
Tartar's handwriting, and the envelope, which
had never been sealed, was marked with her monogram.
Ph&oelig;be's heart tightened with the old
pang. She held it in her hands. What had Tartar
had to say to him on February 2d? That was
just the week before the plan for going abroad
was started. What had Tartar had to say to him?
She had a right to know. If men had been writing
notes to her, Barry would have thought he
had a right to read them, if he had found them

<!-- page 190 -->

lying in his way. She had never looked at any
letter of his before that he had not given her to
read; but then she had never had in her hand one
written him by Tartar. The temptation was new;
the circumstance of her present happiness and
confidence made it strong. She said to herself, "I
ought to be ashamed of myself for doubting him
after what he said in his letter the other day. I
<i>am</i> ashamed, and yet I do doubt. If I look at
this, it will stop the pain, it will clear everything
up. There is nothing in it; <i>I know</i> there is nothing
in it. If I put it back without looking inside,
the thought will torment me. It will spoil the
pleasure of his coming. It is best to make an end
of the suspicion, even by doing something that
may hurt my self-respect a little. But why should
it hurt my self-respect? I have a right. It is
not as if I had had no cause for distrust. I <i>have</i>
had cause, though I have put away from me the
recollection of it. I want to end this forever.
Perhaps this will be the last time that I shall have
such a feeling." Still she did not open the letter.
She held it in her hand, with her eyes fastened
on the inoffensive words upon the envelope, her
lips pressed together, her whole face inscrutably
changed. The baby roused and began to fret.
She went to him and bent over him, and tried to
quiet him, not harshly, but woodenly, without feeling
or tenderness, as if she were thinking of things
in which he had no part. He refused to be quieted,

<!-- page 191 -->

but twisted about, and put up his struggling little
arms. "Come, then," she said, for he was hungry;
and taking him out of his soft bed, she wrapped
a blanket about him and sat down near the fire.
He nestled close, seeking with hungry hands and
with eager lips, like a little animal guided by the
scent of food, the breast which she made bare for
him. She settled him on her arm, and drew the
blanket over him, but paid no further heed to
him. He lay looking in her face with the half-speculating
but satisfied expression in his eyes
that one often sees in a nursing baby's; but she
turned away and did not answer them. Finally
the wide-open eyelids began to droop, the eager
lips drew less and less eagerly, and the satiated
baby slept. She put him back again in his cradle,
and settled the blankets over him, and shaded his
eyes from the light, turning back to put the ruffles
of the little pillow smooth under his shoulder, and
to wipe away with her handkerchief the white drop
that hung on his bright red lip. Then she pushed
the handkerchief into her pocket and drew out the
envelope again, going towards the window as she
did it. She held it in her hand, not looking at it
any more, but gazing with fixed eyes out upon the
dreary, rain-soaked scene. The shutter, loosened
from its fastening, came banging against the window,
with some caprice of the ill-tempered wind.
She mechanically put up the sash and stretched
out her fine white hand and arm into the cold

<!-- page 192 -->

rain to fasten it back. A great rush of chilly air
came into the room before she shut the window
down again. She turned, with hard eyes, to see
if the noise or the chill had disturbed the baby's
sleep. No; he had health in his veins, and she
had fire in hers, and neither of them felt the icy
breath that had come in.</p>

<p>Should she read it, and put herself out of pain?
For that it would put her out of pain she confidently
told herself. An honorable instinct forbade
her to read what was not meant for her to
see; but against that honorable instinct a hundred
good reasons marshaled themselves. How could
a poor little instinct hold out against this host?
The fight was a hot one, but was not very long.
She pulled the paper from the envelope. For a
moment there was a glare before her eyes, but
from the blur presently the words came out.
There was neither address nor signature, nor any
date. It was unmistakably Tartar's hand; the
initials on the paper were as unmistakably hers.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be read: "Without disguise and without
excuse, I have acknowledged my love for you.
Concealment between us in the past was fatal; in
the future it will be impossible. You have taken
it out of my hands by your abrupt words last
night. Why could you not have been silent, when
speaking could no longer do anybody any good?
Ah! what we have before us! This is only the
beginning. If I see you to-morrow, as you ask,

<!-- page 193 -->

remember never to ask it again. It cannot be
wrong to say good-by to you, for it shall be good-by,
though we may meet every day for years.
<i>Remember, it must be good-by</i>."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be had been reading, standing by the window.
Her eyes went two or three times over the
words before she mastered them. A feeling of
illness overcame her, and she made two or three
staggering steps towards a chair, in which she sat
down. There was a tight, dreadful feeling across
her chest, and her breath seemed stifled and
pressed back into it. All the color went out of
her face. Then it was true,&mdash;all her fears, all
her doubts of him. All his lightness of heart at
going away meant that. All his staying in town
through the dreary winter meant that. All his
weariness and <i>ennui</i>, his commonplace answers,
his silences, his unlover-likeness, meant that; and
all his fond words in his last letter to her meant
covering it up and blinding her. She had struggled
with herself and reasoned herself for months
into believing that it was just the change that
comes over all men after marriage. No, it was a
worse change than other women have to see. She
had lost him. The love on which she had staked
everything was gone, ended, dead. For the moment,
she did not feel jealous or angry. If he had
been there, she might almost have thrown herself
at his feet and implored him to give her back his
love. She would have sued him for it as she

<!-- page 194 -->

would have sued Heaven for her child's life, struck
with mortal illness. The grief that desolated her
would have made her forget everything else. The
thirst that consumed her would have dried up all
lesser feelings.</p>

<p>The Carthaginian queen stretching out her
arms to the ships fading from sight on the "endless
sea" was not struck with a suddener, more
appalling sense of helpless bereavement than poor
nineteenth-century Ph&oelig;be, sitting, stunned, by
the aesthetic mantelpiece in Barry's little study.
Human nature is much alike in all ages. You
cannot do more than love a man entirely, whatever
century you happen to be born in. You cannot be
more than desolated, whether it be by command
of the gods, to which your &AElig;neas is not disinclined,
or solicitation of the world, the flesh,
and the devil, which your Barry does not resist.
There are diverse ways of taking your loss,&mdash;as
diverse as the temperaments of women from those
distant times till these. By far the least hard is
the heroic treatment, if one's nerves and creed
permit. Who would not rather Dido's swift
sword and flame, and the chance of getting square
with &AElig;neas in the other world, and giving him a
piece of one's mind in Hades, than the prolonged
torture of a deserted woman nowadays, like the
Madonna carried in procession,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Smiling and smart,<br/>

With a pink satin gown, all spangles,<br/>

And seven swords stuck in her heart"?</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>Ah, we see our &AElig;neases sail away from us
sometimes, we know that they are gone forever,
while in their places stay with us some shadowy,
strange, unreal things that wear their shapes, with
whom we have to live, for whom we have to smile
our smiles and curb our tongues and bear our burdens.
All that was easy to do before is hard and
hateful now.</p>

<p>As Ph&oelig;be sat motionless with the letter in her
hand, looking at the smouldering fire without seeing
it, some far-away anticipations of the life she
would have to lead came over her, succeeding the
first agony. It would be only two days before
she would be obliged to meet him, to treat him as
nearly as might be as she had treated him before&mdash;before
what? His treachery? Had he meant to
desert her? Had he meant to do what his fate had
made him do? No, surely, he had never been a
coward, he had never been cruel. It was simply,
destiny was too strong for him. He had loved his
cousin all his life; he had been diverted from
it by some misunderstanding. His cousin was
the one to whom he belonged; his wife was the
usurper. Then what a sharp pang came, and with
it a rage of anger, a fire of jealousy. No; he
might have loved Tartar,&mdash;she had played with
him, had thrown him off, perhaps, in the old days;
but he had loved her, Ph&oelig;be, in that strange,
delirious time, that was so full of bitter and sweet
to remember, and Tartar had robbed her. She
was desolate no longer, but maddened.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

If she could have hated him steadfastly it would
have been easier. She did hate him, in bitter
gusts and tempests of feeling, but she yearned for
him so passionately that her hatred melted again
and again at some chance recollection, and she
only hated for ever and ever the woman who had
lured him from her.</p>

<p>How do people live through days like this? It
gives one a respect for the human brain and the
material part of us to know that they seldom dissolve
or go into chaotic disorder under such pressure.</p>

When Mary Ann came up to tell her mistress
that her dinner was ready, the girl started, and
asked, looking blank, if she were ill. As Mary
Ann's perceptive powers were of the lowest order,
there must have been some conspicuous change to
call out the question. Ph&oelig;be turned her face away
from her, and said she was not ill, but only tired;
she had the feeling, which she did not arrange into
words, that she was then putting on the mask
which she would never take off again as long as
she lived. When we are very young, everything
is going to be "forever." As we grow older we
find that it is possible to outlive &AElig;neas himself
and the sword of despair, and even the flames of
annihilation. Middle-aged anguish says to itself,
"This will wear out." It is by so much less a
stimulant.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">PEYTON EDWARDS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> evening the rain turned to snow.
The ground was chilled enough to bear a thin coat
of it. It looked a winter scene when Ph&oelig;be pushed
her way out of the heavy, slowly-moving front
door into the early twilight. The snow had
ceased to fall, but the chill of it filled the air,
which was damp as well with the long day of rain.
The sky was dull with monotonous clouds: it was
all most dreary. There are some states of mind
in which one cannot stay in the house; Ph&oelig;be
had gone out because it seemed as if she could not
draw another breath in the stifling atmosphere
within. She longed to walk and tire herself,
and get rid of this pain which was to last forever,
and which had just begun. She had no purpose in
her walk, only to walk, and that not slowly. She
had waited for the twilight because she did not
want to be seen by any curious eyes. Since Mary
Ann had recognized the trouble on her face, she
did not want any one else to have a chance to
see it.</p>

<p>The houses along the road are just beginning

<!-- page 198 -->

to be lighted: at the door of one a young wife
stands waiting for her husband, coming down the
walk on his return from town. Poor Ph&oelig;be
turns away with a bitter pain. At another, a
nurse sits in the window with a white baby in her
arms, who drums upon the pane, while a carriage
turns in at the gate, and an eager pair lean forward
and wave salutations to the baby.</p>

<p>The stage comes rolling down the road; people
are getting out at another expectant cottage,&mdash;guests,
valises, welcomes, kisses. The light from
the door shines across the snow,&mdash;such a babble,
such merriment. Sore-hearted, she wonders what
they can find to be so happy about.</p>

<p>She passes an old house that stands but a little
way back from the street. The great trees in
front of it, now bare, do not protect it from the
passers-by, nor the dry, brittle hedge on which
the snow is lying. A light streams across the
wide piazza; between the pillars of it is a window,
through which one sees the peaceful picture of an
old lady reading by a lamp. The street is quiet
here, no one is passing; Ph&oelig;be leans against the
fence and gazes in. It is a face she knows well
and has often seen in church, and thought of when
she was in trouble: a sort of benediction that
blesses the eyes that look on it,&mdash;serene with love
of God, tender with love of man, cheering, self-forgetting.
Ah, Ph&oelig;be wonders, as she looks,
was that peace bought through suffering? Is that

<!-- page 199 -->

power to bless its price? She knows that in the
churchyard, hard by, lie more than one beloved
who have left her. But they left her <i>that</i> way.
One might be the better for sorrow, but not <i>this
sort</i>. She thinks of the children that rise up and
call this calm woman blessed, of the troops of
friends that gather round her old age, of the silent
influence she has, of the honor in which her town's-people
hold her. Was it</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"The not unpeaceful ending of a day<br/>

Made black by morning storms"?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>She longs to speak to her, to ask for her pity, her
prayers. But the calm saint reads on by the
peaceful household lamp, and poor Ph&oelig;be goes
away uncomforted.</p>

<p>She turned down another street and went towards
the churchyard, of which the gate stood
open. The church itself was shut, not resembling
in all things the God whom it professed to represent,
who neither slumbers nor sleeps. It looked
dark and cold. She tried the door, but it was
fastened against her. If she could have found
sanctuary there for a little while, and in the silence
and dimness have cried to God before that
altar! Well, she was not sure that it would have
done her any good. She sat down on the step
a while till she grew cold, and then, remembering
scornfully that she had a body yet to be taken
care of, she got up and walked through the snow
to the graves that lay so still under the still, bare

<!-- page 200 -->

trees and the still, dark sky. "To mortals no
sorrow is immortal." At least, she thought, there
is cure here. She wished that her baby were lying
here dead, and she beside him. She thought
of the many paragraphs in the papers, that she
had read with horror, of poor mothers who had
drowned, or burned, or butchered their children,
and then themselves, when the furnace of domestic
misery had become too fiery hot, and their tortured
nerves had reached the point of madness.
She did not mean to kill herself; she knew she
was not mad; she almost wished she were,&mdash;that
would be one way out of it. What way <i>was</i> there
out of it for long-living, healthy, strong-suffering,
silent Ph&oelig;be?</p>

<p>But it was cold. Her feet were wet, and her
skirts draggled with the snow and slush. Her
sense of neatness felt the outrage, even at her high
tragedy pitch. She left the cold graveyard and
the colder church, and went out again at the gate,
more desolate than she had come in. Outside the
gate there was a street lamp, and in the halo of
this she stood for a moment irresolute. Presently,
out of the misty dimness beyond it, came the
sound of a man's step, and she started uncomfortably.
The side street on which the churchyard
opened was without houses; it was a lonely spot,
though near the heart of the town. Before she
could get out of the range of the lamp the step
was beside her,&mdash;an amazed exclamation, and she
was face to face with Peyton Edwards.</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p>"What are you doing in the churchyard? Has
anything happened?" he said, in a direct way, for
it was impossible to talk conventionally in such a
spot, and with Ph&oelig;be's face and dress testifying
so loudly to her abandoned misery. She did not
answer, but turned silently towards home, and he
walked beside her.</p>

<p>"Nobody is ill?" he asked. "You haven't
heard bad news from&mdash;them?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong," he went on, after
waiting a minute or two for her reply, while they
made their way through the slush and mire. "I
should think you might speak to me. You know
they're like my own people."</p>

<p>"I am not your 'own people.' I'm nobody's
people," she thought; but she only said, "I'm
not, though."</p>

<p>"Well, I've always felt as if you were, any
way," he answered. A sort of sob rose in Ph&oelig;be's
throat. She had always trusted Peyton Edwards.
He had seemed more like a friend than any one
else in her new, strange home.</p>

<p>"I've had a lonely time," she said. "I haven't
had a soul to speak to since they went away."</p>

<p>"I was afraid so. I've thought about you a
great deal," he answered. "I've just come from
the train, for it's been bothering me all day, and I
made up my mind to come out and see how you
were getting on."</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p>"You didn't come for anything else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You haven't heard anything?" she asked,
with a suspicious glance at his face, which the
corner lamp under which they had come showed
her.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, straightforwardly. "I
sent around to the office this afternoon, but they
said there was no news. Barry hasn't written
to me since he went away."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not speak.</p>

<p>"I suppose Barry'll be coming home pretty
soon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He'll be here on Thursday," she said.</p>

<p>"Thursday? Then you oughtn't to be looking this way."</p>

<p>She did not answer, and they walked on for the
length of a block in silence.</p>

<p>"Isn't he well?" asked Peyton, at last. "If
there's any trouble, I wish you'd tell me."</p>

<p>"It's <i>my</i> trouble," she answered. "May be
you wouldn't think that counted."</p>

<p>"I do think it counts. I've thought about you
a great deal. I felt Barry ought not to have
gone."</p>

<p>"Then you knew, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Knew what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't just his leaving me alone."</p>

<p>"Well, that was all I blamed him for; the baby
being so little, and you a stranger here, and&mdash;and&mdash;the

<!-- page 203 -->

place and the people being so&mdash;new to
you."</p>

<p>"I understand. Oh, I didn't mind that. As
long as it was all right between him and me I
could stand all that."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope it's all right now. You're not
the kind of woman to fancy things. You don't
need me to tell you how Barry feels about you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't need any one to tell me," she said,
between her teeth.</p>

<p>Peyton looked anxiously towards her, for it
crossed his mind that her loneliness might have
worn upon her nerves and rendered her morbid, if
not absolutely unsound mentally. He remembered
how young her baby was, and how much of a
strain there had been upon her for the whole past
year. Silent and unmistakably manly as he was,
there was an acute understanding in him of
women's sufferings, and an acute tenderness, too,
well understood by the little girls who swept the
crossings that he passed daily, and the women
who scrubbed the halls and stairways of the down
town offices which he frequented. His heart was
tolerably hard towards men, but very soft towards
women who were "down on their luck." And it
was not necessary that the objects of his sympathy
should be good-looking always, either. By this
time, with their halting slow talk, and steady,
though rather quick walk, these two people who
were not in the habit of talking about their feelings,

<!-- page 204 -->

got inside the gate, and well on towards the
house.</p>

<p>"You think I'm crazy, I suppose," said Ph&oelig;be,
abruptly, as they approached the piazza steps.</p>

<p>"No, not that altogether," he answered, hesitatingly,
for it was so exactly what he had been
thinking that he could not honestly deny it, and
he had not the readiness to dissemble.</p>

<p>"I've had enough to make me," she said, "but
I don't suppose I'm the kind that goes crazy. All
along I have been blaming myself for everything,
but now I know I have been badly used."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I know you can't. I didn't think I could
ever talk to anybody about such a thing as this.
But&mdash;won't you ring the bell? Mary Ann has
locked the door."</p>

<p>While they waited for the opening of the door
they stood without speaking, Peyton not looking
at her, but with silent, deep thoughts, no doubt,
and a clouded face. When Mary Ann, quite out of
breath, got the door open, Ph&oelig;be walked in first,
and reproved her for not having the hall lamp
lighted. Mary Ann always had a good reason
to give for what she did and what she omitted
to do. It was the baby who was fretting, and
wouldn't let her lay him down a minute, ma'am.
Ph&oelig;be left her in the full tide of her explanations,
and shut the library door, and so cut off the
stream.</p>

<!-- page 205 -->

<p>The library fire was burning, and the room
looked comfortable by its blaze, but there was
no lamp lighted. Ph&oelig;be took off her bonnet
and cloak and laid them on a chair in the corner,
then went to a jar that held matches, and, stooping
down, lighted one at the fire, and went over
to the lamp. Peyton sat down. He did not look
into the fire or about the room, nor did he follow
with his eyes the movements of the tall, beautiful
young woman whose unknown trouble was occupying
all his thoughts, but stared before him at
nothing, and was as silent as a Sphinx.</p>

<p>Certainly he was not sympathetic looking; why
did Ph&oelig;be and the scrub-women and the crossing
sweepers pick him out from all the crowd of
handsomer, more genial, more amiable-looking
men? People in trouble have an instinct that
rarely leads them wrong. When Ph&oelig;be had
lighted the lamp and put the shade on it and
turned it carefully to the right height, she sat
down, too, and gazed before her some minutes
without speaking. Her hand was in her pocket,
as if she held something there on which her
thoughts were centred. She tried to speak several
times, but failed; then with a slow, determined
gesture with the hand that lay upon the arm of
her chair, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going to show you something that I found
to-day. I don't believe you'll think me crazy
when you read it. I suppose you know the writing;

<!-- page 206 -->

perhaps you know more about what's past
than I do. It isn't new to me, but it's "&mdash;</p>

<p>Her voice choked. She pulled the envelope
from her pocket, and taking the paper out of it
handed it to him. He got up and went towards
the light to read it. The writing he certainly
recognized. A slight flush mounted to his forehead,
but faded as he read. In fact, he turned a
stony gray; his face was no longer expressionless
and neutral, but showed that he was enduring a
pain sharp enough to need much self-control.
Ph&oelig;be did not move her eyes from him, but with
parted lips watched the effect upon him of what
he read. A look of satisfaction came into her eyes.
It was not imagination, then. Poor Ph&oelig;be had
had so many struggles with herself against doubts
that she could not prove that it was in a certain
sense a satisfaction to find she held a proof that
gave so much pain to some one else. Her companion
did not speak for some minutes. His eyes
went over and over the words before him; he
seemed to hunt for escape from some most painful
conviction. When he first attempted to speak,
his voice failed; his failure to control himself
seemed to make him angry. When he spoke
again, it was quite distinctly.</p>

<p>"Where did you find this&mdash;note?" he said,
still looking at it, and not at her.</p>

<p>"In Barry's desk, that I was putting in order."</p>

<p>"It has been there&mdash;since&mdash;since before he
went away?"</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"There is the date of it," she said, getting up
and giving him the envelope.</p>

<p>"You don't often go to the desk?" he asked,
slowly, after a few moments' pause.</p>

<p>"No, never before. He always kept it locked.
At the last moment the day he was going away,
there was great hurry and confusion; just as he
was locking it, while they were calling to him from
down-stairs to come, the lock broke; he had to
leave it or be left. He told me to take the keys
out and attend to it. I suppose for the moment
he forgot&mdash;what was in it&mdash;or thought I would
not likely look."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Ph&oelig;be sat down again,
but Peyton stood motionless, his eyes fixed on
vacancy, the hand with the letter in it hanging at
his side, his face pallid.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about the past," she
went on slowly, at last. "I don't know whether
he could have helped that part of it or not&mdash;but&mdash;going 
away together"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The envelope was not sealed," he said, as if
he had not heard her, looking down at it.</p>

<p>"No; she has handed it to him some time.
They were together every day; I knew that. So
many nights he did not come home. And this
was just the week before the sudden plan to go
abroad. I never knew she was going till&mdash;till
that last day at dinner."</p>

<p>Peyton seemed hardly to hear her, but to be
carried on by his own thoughts.</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>"Damn him!" he said, suddenly, under his
breath, crushing the paper that he held in his
hand, and throwing it from him.</p>

<p>"Damn <i>her!</i>" said Ph&oelig;be, setting her lips together
and lifting her burning eyes to his. A
shudder passed over him; he walked two or three
times across the room, then stopped before the
mantelpiece and leaned against it.</p>

<p>"Don't speak so," he began, in a husky voice.
"A woman ought to say her prayers"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shan't say any prayers for her."</p>

<p>"Well, she needs them"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope she'll need them more and more; I
hope"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush," said Peyton, hoarsely, lifting his head.
Ph&oelig;be and he looked each other in the eyes for a
moment; and then Ph&oelig;be, with a sort of sigh
that was half a groan, leaned back in her chair
and looked away from him. It was a bitter, miserable
consolation to know that some one else was
enduring the pain that she was,&mdash;some one
stronger, and some one whom she had respected.
If jealousy and the wound of treachery could
make his face so ashy and his eyes so fierce, she
need not feel ashamed for herself. She got up
and went across the room and picked up the paper
that he had thrown from him, and smoothed it
out and put it back into the envelope.</p>

<p>At this moment Mary Ann rolled back the
door that led into the dining-room, and appeared

<!-- page 209 -->

in the entrance with the baby under her arm, announcing
tea. At this interruption the two who
were so far away from thoughts of commonplace
comfort or discomfort experienced the wholesome
though hateful shock of recall to actual life. Peyton's
first impulse was to go away, but he submitted
when Ph&oelig;be said, "You'd better stay."</p>

<p>They went to the table; it was as small as it
could be made, but was still far too large for the
two people who sat down to it and the slender
meal set forth upon it. Ph&oelig;be's hands shook a
little as she poured out the tea. Peyton set down
his cup, and scarcely tried to drink it. He took
some things to eat upon his plate, but did not eat
them. He sat looking before him in a fixed way,
not attempting to speak. Mary Ann chirruped
to the baby, which was the only conversation that
enlivened the meal except the apologies which she
made for bringing him down-stairs. He just
wouldn't go to sleep, she said, and it was the
cook's night out, and tea couldn't be kept waiting
any longer. It may have surprised her that
these apologies did not have any interest&mdash;for Mr.
Peyton Edwards or her mistress; she gradually
grew more reticent, and chirruped in a whisper
to the baby when she passed him. She had set
him down on the sofa and barricaded him in with
pillows. He goo-ed at her with placid interest,
and struck aimless blows upon the pillow before
him. The baby in his wide unconsciousness and

<!-- page 210 -->

the nurse in her narrow ignorance made a strange
contrast to the two others of the <i>partie carr&eacute;e</i>.
When at last these latter moved away into the next
room, Mary Ann in haste clattered the tea things
off, with kind consideration for the cook's outing.
The baby set up a little whine for his mother;
she took him in her arms and walked about with
him for quiet's sake. Mary Ann, with more apologies
and more whispered chirrups, went off to her
own supper. Peyton stood looking into the fire
as if there was no one in the room beside himself.
Once or twice he started as if to speak, but
stopped, walked two or three times across the
room, and stood again beside the fire. The commonplace
tea and Mary Ann had turned the key
on his utterance and on Ph&oelig;be's, and they could
no more go back to the mental attitude of the
hour before than they could make it six o'clock
instead of seven.</p>

<p>The baby fell asleep uneasily, and lay across
his mother's knees, a heavy weight. Mary Ann
came back and tiptoed about the room, not to
wake him. At last the slender meal was all out
of sight, the windows barred, the light turned
down, and the large, empty-looking dining-room
left to its night's repose. Then Mary Ann, with
slightly curious glances, came into the library and
held out her arms for the baby. Ph&oelig;be put him
in them, wrapped his blanket round him, drew
an end of it over his head, and opened the door
for her.</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

"The hall is cold: be quick," she said.</p>

<p>Mary Ann looked back furtively while her mistress
was closing the door; she wondered what
they were going to talk about. She need not
have wondered. They were not going to talk.
After a while Peyton got up and told her he was
going; he would see her in the morning. This
was a relief; it would be easier to talk to-morrow.
After he was gone she turned down the lamp, and
drew her chair close to the fire, and sat down and
bent forward towards it and tried to warm herself,
for she was strangely cold. She began to think
after a while that she was going to have a chill.
All that wet snow in the churchyard and in the
streets and the damp night air and her terrible
excitement would be so many deadly enemies to
the poor little mortal who took his life from hers.
The baby,&mdash;she almost hated him as she got up
from her low seat and went to find some medicine,
and a shawl to wrap herself in. She was denied
even the luxury of brooding over her trouble, of
desperately risking herself. And finally came the
voice of Mary Ann: the child would not sleep;
there simply was not any use in rocking him; he
just would not. Then setting her teeth together
she followed the nurse up-stairs, and spent the
first night of her great desolation with a fretting
baby in her arms, and spongia and aconite in
alternation with despair and jealousy.</p>

<p class="small">BARRY'S RETURN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> before Thursday the baby got over his
croupish attack, and Ph&oelig;be was not seriously the
worse for her chill. They were well endowed
physically, both mother and child, and it takes a
great deal of mental anguish to undermine a good
country constitution. Ph&oelig;be had spent nineteen
years in a fine climate, with calm and uneventful
days alternating still and peaceful nights; she
had been much in the open air; she had not been
idle either in mind or body; she had had no quarrel
with her simple life, but had been happy in it.
She had inherited from a robust father fine health
and power of endurance. It would take a good
many months of such nights and days as she had
just passed through to make her permanently ill.</p>

<p>Peyton had come out once each day to see her.
There was not much that he could say, but he
seemed to have a care of her, and she clung to
him in thought as her only earthly friend. He
telegraphed on Thursday morning to her that the
steamer was in, and again that the passengers
were landed, and on what train it would be possible

<!-- page 213 -->

for Barry to go out to Marrowfat. After
this came a telegram from Barry himself, saying
at what hour he would be at home. So there was
no uncertainty and no long waiting.</p>

<p>The day had been a fine and clear one; the sunset
was just reddening the sky and bronzing the
bare trees and the brown earth, when Ph&oelig;be
from the library window saw a carriage drive into
the grounds. She held the child tight in her
arms; her breath seemed to stop. She saw Barry
burst open the door of the cab and leap out, with
an eager look up at the house. She tried to go
forward and open the door, but there are some
things we cannot do, even if we try. Barry had
to open the door for himself, which no doubt was
a little chill to his enthusiasm. In the hall, by
the entrance to the library, stood Ph&oelig;be, white
and quiet, with the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>"Well!" he cried, with eager joyfulness, dashing
at them and enfolding them in one embrace.
He kissed Ph&oelig;be again and again, and then the
baby, and then Ph&oelig;be. He looked brown and
well, with a fine color in his cheeks, and his eyes
dancing with pleasure. You could not fancy a
happier-looking man; so handsome, too, in his
traveling clothes, so distinguished, so broad and
high and manly. "Well! You aren't glad, I suppose!"
he cried, as he gave her another kiss and
another.</p>

<p>"The door," she said, faintly, gathering the

<!-- page 214 -->

baby's blanket up when for an instant he released
her. "I am afraid he'll feel the air."</p>

<p>Barry turned back and banged the door shut in
the driver's face, who was bringing in some things
that had been left in the carriage.</p>

<p>"Bother the man! he's got to be paid, I suppose,"
he exclaimed, plunging his hand into his
pocket and tossing him a coin while Ph&oelig;be retreated
into the library. He did not wait for the
change, but telling the man to leave the things in
the hall, he followed Ph&oelig;be into the library, and
threw his arm around her.</p>

<p>"It's rather rough on a fellow," he said, "not
only to have to open the door for himself, when
he's come a journey of three thousand miles to see
his family, but to be told the first thing to shut it
after him. But no matter!"</p>

<p>"Baby's had a threatening of croup," said
Ph&oelig;be, rather huskily.</p>

<p>"He has? Bless the little man, he doesn't
look it."</p>

<p>He caught the child in his arms, and threw him
up, and looked at him with pride and pleasure,
and kissed him again and again. "There isn't
another child as handsome in the world," he said.
"And he's grown tremendously. You rascal, sir,
I ought to have brought you a set of razors and
a pair of riding-boots." He smothered him with
kisses after this flight into the future, and then he
gave him back to his mother, and put his arm

<!-- page 215 -->

around her waist, and drew her head against his
shoulder, as if it were she, and not the child, after
all, that he was most glad to have again. "It
seems a year," he said fondly, "since I went
away." Then he held her off from him and looked
at her. "But you're not looking exactly well,"
he said. "You're pale."</p>

<p>"Baby's kept me awake," she said, evasively,
looking away.</p>

<p>"Why do you let him? Turn him over to
Mary Ann. I'll set all that right," and he took
her in his arms again. The fact that she was holding
the baby made some excuse for his not having
his caresses returned. You cannot caress a person
very much without the use of your hands. When,
therefore, Mary Ann appeared shyly in the door,
Barry hailed her with a bluff greeting, and told
her to take the baby for a little while.</p>

<p>"Don't let him get cold," he added, as the girl
carried him away. And then he turned to Ph&oelig;be,
and with his arm around her waist and both her
hands pinioned by his walked towards the fire-place, 
where a gay little fire was crackling. Ph&oelig;be
had grown paler and paler. This was infinitely
worse than a captious, cold, or constrained greeting.
The thought of its falseness never left her
mind, nor the conviction of his nature's shallowness
and easiness. It was such a cruel travesty of
the past; it was so torturing to the hunger of her
heart. It takes a good deal of cold to chill the

<!-- page 216 -->

circulation of some people's blood, and it took a
good deal to chill the circulation of Barry's hope
and confidence, but by and by he began to feel
indefinably the lowering of the temperature. He
had thrown himself into a chair before the fire,
and, stretching out his arm, tried to pull Ph&oelig;be
down upon his knee. But she resisted, standing
back by the mantel, and saying, "I must go and
see about baby."</p>

<p>"Well," he cried, in a tone of pique, "that's
pretty soon to desert me, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Why, you," she said, embarrassed, "you'll
want to go up-stairs yourself. Don't you want to
wash your hands before dinner, and&mdash;brush your
hair a little?"</p>

<p>"What! do I look such a savage?" he said, with
the confidence of a handsome man, pushing his
hand through his brown hair. He got up and
stood beside her, close to her. It seemed as if he
could not keep away from her, cold or kind. He
began to look about for some explanation of her
lack of warmth. Perhaps it was unpreparedness.
He knew she was reserved and undemonstrative;
possibly she had not received the warning of his
coming, and the shock to her nerves of his sudden
appearance might account for her pallor and
silence.</p>

<p>"Did you get the telegram?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "The last one just an
hour ago."</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>"The last? Why, I only sent one."</p>

<p>"I know: but Peyton Edwards telegraphed me
after he went away this morning that the steamer
was in the bay, and then later that you had probably
landed."</p>

<p>"Peyton Edwards? You don't say. I didn't
even suppose he knew that I was on the way home.
I wonder that he didn't come down to the wharf
to meet me."</p>

<p>They were standing before the fire, which had
deepened into a broad blaze. Barry was looking
into his wife's face in the interested way in which
we look into the faces of those from whom we have
been parted for a length of time. As he said these
words, carelessly, scarcely thinking that she heard
them or would note them, a sudden rush of color
came over her face. She was thinking, "When
will he know why he didn't go to meet him?"
And when she felt the hot blush on her face, and
saw that her husband was startled by it, her
thought was, not that he would have any unworthy
suspicion of her or of his friend, but that
he would in it read the truth. She felt as if the
story were printed on her face, and forgot (as people
unused to deception often do) how much more
she knew than he did. The blood receded, and she
grew pale again, and her eyes were troubled and
downcast. Barry scrutinized her face keenly for a
moment. Then his glance brightened. It was impossible
to doubt her (or his own empire, either).</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>"Come," he said, "if you insist on my ablutions,
I will go up with you."</p>

<p>But he did not put his arm about her again, and
he went up-stairs after her, both of them laden
with shawls and bags and books, that the cabman
had left in the hall, and that the flighty Mary Ann
had failed even to lift from the floor.</p>

<p>"Where are all your servants?" he said, on the
way up.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any but the cook, and she's
busy with the dinner, and Mary Ann can't leave
the baby."</p>

<p>"What's become of the waitress?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I concluded to do without her."</p>

<p>"Why this parsimony?"</p>

<p>"I've been trying to economize."</p>

<p>Barry laughed lightly. "Well, we won't do
any more of that," he said. "Affairs are marching
very well. We've made a good thing of it.
Even my father can't find anything to grumble at,
and I am more than satisfied. I tell you, Ph&oelig;be,
that little fellow in his cradle up-stairs will have a
better start in life, a good deal, than his father
had."</p>

<p>"I don't think you had much to complain of."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are starts and starts. I mean the
boy shall have some advantages that I've always
felt the need of."</p>

<p>"People always say that."</p>

<p>"I know: but it's well for the race to go on
improving."</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"Only nobody can see the improvement. The
ones that don't have any start always get ahead."</p>

<p>When they were at the dinner-table (it had
been tea when she was alone; now it had risen to
dinner, and was served in courses as long as the
baby would lie still), Barry again reverted to Peyton
Edwards's telegram, and with similar results.</p>

<p>"It was very good-natured in him to see about
the steamer and send you word," he said,&mdash;"very.
I must look him up to-morrow."</p>

<p>Again the strange color and pallor and agitation
followed each other on Ph&oelig;be's face. Barry
would have been more than mortal if he had not
felt a sudden sharp suspicion cross his mind. But
he was a man of the world. He went on carelessly,
with no change in his voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has he been out lately?"</p>

<p>"He was here&mdash;this morning," returned Ph&oelig;be,
her voice gathering strength, for this was not
what agitated her.</p>

<p>"Ah! And what does he have to say? What
has he been about lately? I suppose he's working
like a dog, as usual."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't think so. But I don't know.
He wouldn't be likely to talk about business to
me."</p>

<p>The thought of what he did talk about, the
only thing of any kind regarding which they had
exchanged a word, made her flush guiltily again.
Would Barry see it all? Would he ask her in the

<!-- page 220 -->

next breath how she dared to speak to another
of their relations to each other? This was her
thought and dread, and only this.</p>

<p>Barry had seen enough for this time. He
changed the subject, and went into details of his
journey and accounts of the family party left
abroad. His mother was not looking well; traveling
seemed to tire her, while it freshened up his
father wonderfully. Honor was as gay as a bird;
she kept them all in fine spirits, was admired everywhere,
and as willful as ever. She declared she
never would come home, and he almost believed
she would keep her word. She hated Marrowfat
with a hate unprecedented. Lucy was sweet and
good as ever; mended everybody's gloves as well
as tempers, carried out all plans but her own, kept
the peace between Tartar and Aunt David, and
was the good fairy of the party. Ph&oelig;be could not
find voice to ask any questions; she felt as if she
were choking while Barry talked about his life of
the past two months so easily and carelessly. He
grew a little absent-minded as he talked, and his
brow knit. He was leading back to the subject
which was uppermost in his mind, and he wished
to reach it naturally.</p>

<p>"By the way, I mustn't forget," he said.
"I've got a little package for Peyton from Tartar.
It's in my valise, I think. Help me to remember
it in the morning. I'll take it over to him."</p>

<p>His keen and angry eyes did not miss a shade

<!-- page 221 -->

of the change that came over her face at these
words. She did not attempt to look up, but sat
with her head a little bent down, a deadly, sickly
pallor taking the place of her ordinary coloring.
She was thinking of that deep imprecation, that
fierce "damn him," that Peyton had uttered when
he first discovered Barry's treason. What would
their meeting be? She wished that she had died
before she had told him anything. What good
was his sympathy compared with all this peril to
Barry and to him? She had never sinned much
in giving her confidence to others; why should
her first fault of unreserve have such a punishment?
What would she give to unsay what she
had said! How could she prevent or postpone
this meeting? It seemed to her that anything
that could put it off a while would be so much
gained; just a few days till Peyton should have
cooled down a little. Alas, she remembered that
people like Peyton do not cool down; they are always
at one heat. What Peyton meant to do half
an hour after the letter was in his hands he would
go on meaning to do, and doing, till his steady
heart stopped beating. He would always be good
to her; he would always be hard, though just, to
Tartar; he would always be unrelenting towards
Barry. Time could not change him nor years wear
out his first impression. Still, she wished that she
could hold them back from meeting: her hand
was feeble, but she stretched it out to retard the
crash a moment longer.</p>

<!-- page 222 -->

<p>"Don't fail to remind me," he said, as he
dropped the stopper in a decanter, and took up his
glass.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;but I think&mdash;that is&mdash;I believe&mdash;he
is going away to-morrow&mdash;you wouldn't
see him if you went"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll send him a dispatch to-night, and get
him to wait over a train. It would be too bad to
miss him. I wonder where he's going."</p>

<p>"I think it's&mdash;Washington, but I can't be sure.
I have forgotten what he said about it. I&mdash;think
he goes quite early in the morning."</p>

<p>"That will be all right. He'll wait for me."</p>

<p>Barry's tone was generally confident; this time
it was a little more than confident. Ph&oelig;be knew
that he was angry; all his good spirits and vivacious
talk could not conceal it. There was no
more warmth, and there were no more caresses received
or rebuffed. The baby gave a rough, barking
cough, and she had to go in haste up-stairs
with him. Barry was left to spend his first evening
at home alone. He walked up and down the
room, pulling at his mustache, and drawing his
brows together in perplexed thought. He was not
of a suspicious or unloving nature; it was hard for
him to make up his mind that he had ground of
complaint against either wife or friend. But this
looked so amazingly like it. When he went away,
Ph&oelig;be and Peyton had not been on any terms of
intimacy that would have made it seem probable

<!-- page 223 -->

that he would come out to Marrowfat to see her.
They had not met more than half a dozen times;
the last year there had been a great diminution of
the frequent visits of the old days. Perhaps he had
come out to see some one else in the place, and had
only called at the house in passing. No: Barry
ran over in his mind all the people whom he could
have had occasion to come to see; they were all
away. He had not an intimate friend in Marrowfat.
Barry remembered once, just before they
went abroad, Peyton, in speaking of the dullness
of the winter and of the changes in the place, said
he had not a friend left there but themselves. It
would have been difficult to account for even one
visit, but there had been many. Two telegrams,
after having seen her this morning! And no word
to him; not even a clerk sent down to the steamer
to get his news, if it were impossible for Peyton
to go himself. But all this, all Peyton's part,
could have been easily remanded to that deep
vault of unclaimed property, of unexplained omissions,
that all generous-minded people keep open
all their lives, and never trouble themselves to descend
into unless at the request of some anxious
owner. "Always trust your friend" had been
Barry's maxim through life, and he had been perfectly
satisfied to follow it. But a wife is a different
thing. She belongs to you, while your friend
belongs, perhaps equally, to a great many others.
While you know she has no material rights that

<!-- page 224 -->

are not subordinate to your right over her, there
is a vague uncertainty about your title to her inner
life that naturally makes you less easy than
if you held it in fee simple. If any one had told
Barry yesterday that he would to-day be doubting
his wife's unquestioning devotion to him, he
would have been much amused. But this coldness,
those hot blushes, that mysterious agitation
and eagerness to prevent a meeting,&mdash;how could
they be explained? Barry would have been more
than mortal if he had not been suspicious, and he
certainly was <i>not</i> more than mortal, not any more.</p>

<p>The evening was not a pleasant one to him.
The last eight or ten, when he had been seasick
and bored and chilly, were agreeable in comparison.
He wrote his dispatch, but when it came to
sending it found himself at a loss for the direction.
He knew that Peyton had changed his hotel; he
was just doing so when they went away. What
one had been decided on he had never known, or
had forgotten. It was useless to send his dispatch
to Peyton's office. He could himself get there in
the morning before it; if Peyton had gone it would
do no good; if he were there he could better judge
what ground he had for complaint if he met him
without preparation. As for asking Ph&oelig;be for
the address, he could more easily have done a much
more difficult thing. Though good-natured and
genial, he was as reserved in one sense as Ph&oelig;be
herself. He could not talk about what he felt,

<!-- page 225 -->

though he could talk endlessly about what he did
not feel. He did feel this unexpected doubt most
uncomfortably; in fact, most damnably, he admitted
to himself. He could no more have gone up
stairs and opened the subject with her or spoken
Peyton's name than he could have taken her
by the throat and made an end of it and of her
on the spot. He was unprepared for either step.
So he went up at bedtime, and scarcely looked at
her when she came into the room and told him
that she had known he would not want to be disturbed,
and so had had the baby's crib moved into
the adjoining room, where she would probably
have to sit np and watch him through the night.
His hoarseness had increased, but she was giving
him very frequent doses; if before midnight it did
not yield to treatment, she thought they ought to
have the doctor. Did he think so?</p>

<p>He thought she knew much more about the
matter than he did, he said, and he should be satisfied
with whatever she decided, unpacking his
valise, with his back turned to her while he did
it. He had the conviction that the baby's illness
was merely her defense against him, and he was
quite resolved not to take any notice of it.</p>

<p>"I will send the cook and Mary Ann, if I have
to send. I know I ought not to disturb you."</p>

<p>He said, coolly, perhaps that would be as well;
he was pretty tired. Disturb him! He wondered
if she did not think she had disturbed him enough

<!-- page 226 -->

already. He counted all the hours strike till five
o'clock, when he dropped into an uneasy sleep,
during which he successively fought a duel with
Peyton and suffered shipwreck in mid-Atlantic.
Out of this he was awakened by Ph&oelig;be's muffled
opening of her wardrobe door at eight o'clock.
He said something very cross, and did not even
ask how the baby was. Ph&oelig;be took what she had
come in for and went out, telling him, when she
got outside the door, to ring when he was ready
to have his breakfast put upon the table.</p>

<p>When he came down to the dining-room he
found her there, ready to pour out his coffee.
This soothed him a little: a man is always the
happier for feeling he is being served by the
woman whom he ought to be serving. He showed
his ameliorated state of feeling by asking how the
baby was. The baby was better; she had not
had to send for the doctor. As if that were any
news to him, who could hear the lightest movement
in the room adjoining, and who knew perfectly
well that the baby had not even coughed
since half-past ten o'clock! It was all a put-up
job, that croup, and he hardened again as he
thought of it.</p>

<p>He hurried off in the 9.15 train, feeling hot and
angry when he thought how certainly he should
miss Peyton if he were really going to Washington,
and how long it would be before he could
have any definite light shed on what disturbed him.

<!-- page 227 -->

To think of bearing this suspense for a week or a
fortnight put him in a very bad humor. He knew
himself capable of behaving as well as any other
man in this position, if the uncertainty were not
too protracted. Now, by daylight, he said to himself,
he did not suppose that there really was anything
for him to resent in their relations to each
other. He was disposed to be reasonable. He
knew that he had left Ph&oelig;be alone for a long
time and under rather trying circumstances. He
must not wonder if Peyton had had some nonsensical
views about protecting her, and all that.
It could not be anything but duty; it was impossible
(by daylight) to associate Peyton with anything
but a stolid pursuit of the "stern daughter."
And Ph&oelig;be, perhaps, had not understood him;
was embarrassed, frightened. It was equally impossible
to think of Ph&oelig;be as anything but&mdash;perfectly
devoted to him.</p>

<p>On the cars he was at once surrounded by gentlemen
glad to welcome him back. Some newspaper
paragraphs about the success of the business interests
that had taken Mr. Crittenden abroad may
possibly have contributed to this welcome. There
is a great deal of human nature even in the
provinces; the Crittendens were rising into notice
again. Mr. Crittenden was a good deal spoken of
among railroad men. It would be his own fault
if he did not make a good deal of money in the
course of the next few months. So Barry was

<!-- page 228 -->

slapped on the shoulder and shaken by the hand,
and familiarly welcomed by all the solid 9.15 men
on the train. It made him feel quite like his old
self. He was not so stupid as not to see why
the tide had turned, but as long as it had turned,
why, that was enough. He was too good-natured
to be critical. Human nature is human nature;
he would not exactly forget the past, but he
would not rake it up. <i>Hic jacet:</i> he would perhaps
keep the moss scraped from the stone, but
he would not do anything so unhandsome as to
go below the surface and dig among the bones;
he knew they were there, but there let them lie.
The experience had done him good; it was incorporated
into his life; he had got all out of it that
it could give him,&mdash;that was enough. Such was
Barry's easy philosophy, and so he met the welcome
cheerfully and with his old jolly freedom of
manner.</p>

<p>The 9.15 train is the banker, the head-of-the-house,
the out-of-business-looking-after-investments-man's
train. These gray-beards are not always the
discreetest. Among them was one who never
thought of Barry but as the possessor of the handsomest
wife in Marrowfat or a much more extended
district. To do him justice, he seldom thought
of him or her at all, but when he did it was in
this relative position and in this light.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, leaning towards him from the
seat behind and speaking in his ear, "you were a

<!-- page 229 -->

brave man to go away and leave your handsome
wife alone!"</p>

<p>He did not speak so low but that another elderly
person of valor, sitting beside Barry, heard
him, and added jocosely, "Mason thinks you'd
better leave her in his charge, next time. We
old fellows are much more responsible than these
younger ones. Now I can recommend Mason, and
Mason can recommend me, eh?"</p>

<p>And then they both laughed, a senile laugh,
that sent Barry into a hot rage of resentment and
jealousy. It was a perfectly random shot. Neither
of them had probably seen Ph&oelig;be during her
husband's absence, and had not thought of her
after the little local gossip about her being left
alone had subsided. It was in very questionable
taste to speak of her in this way to her husband,
but good taste does not seem the natural result of
advanced age in men, and in men living in the
country especially. Barry flushed so perceptibly
that they both saw he was annoyed. The conversation
was abruptly turned upon something else.
In a moment more the express train had drawn
breath in the depot, and bankers and book-agents,
lawyers and laundresses, had made a rush-and-tumble
exit, and were plunging pell-mell to the
ferry-boats.</p>

<p>Naturally Barry got rid of his aged neighbors;
but the new deal did not help him very much.
He was joined on the ferry-boat by a couple of

<!-- page 230 -->

young men, who, having been at a german the
night before, were rather late in getting down to
business. They greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>"You've been back a week or two, haven't
you? No? I've seen Edwards on the train several
times, and I thought he was going up to see
you."</p>

<p>And a look of well-bred inquiry. The look was
perfectly accidental, but of course Barry thought
it was a studied insult. His young friends found
him so stiff and irresponsive that they moved
away, and agreed between themselves that foreign
travel had not improved his manners.</p>

<p>Barry hurried to Peyton's office. Ph&oelig;be was
quite right. He had gone away in the eleven
o'clock train for Washington; stay indefinite, object
unexplained. Barry made sharp and not very
civil inquiries of Peyton's confidential clerk. The
young man, not pleased with his manner, answered
more unsatisfactorily than he would have done if
he had been spoken to with greater suavity. The
impression Barry got from him was that the
journey was a mysterious one; it looked more
like a flight than a journey, to his jaundiced eyes.
The clerk admitted that there was a possibility
that Mr. Edwards might be gone for weeks or
even months. This, to any one who knew Peyton's
business habits, was astounding news. Barry
was not to be blamed for feeling it meant a great
deal. He wanted to knock the clerk down for

<!-- page 231 -->

giving him such intelligence and for having such
cold blue eyes; but they were not quite valid excuses
for doing so, and he went away with a curt
snarl that made the man's cold blue eyes flame
fire, as he looked after him.</p>

<p>Once in his own office, the press of business
after such an absence drew him away from himself.
He spent four hours in close and engrossing
consultation with men who had been awaiting his
return with anxiety. Large interests were at
stake, and Barry found himself lifted into a place
of unusual authority for one of his years. It
stimulated him, naturally. He felt himself equal
to it, and knew his business life was opening up
great vistas of promise. A healthy, honorable
ambition stirred in him. For four hours he forgot
Ph&oelig;be and his paltry jealousy; forgot everything
but the work for which his powers were expanding.
It was not until he neared home in the fast-flying
train that the morning's doubts reasserted
themselves,&mdash;still in a modified way. He was
somewhat ashamed to remember them, but they
came upon him with little sickening rushes of conjecture,
and then died away, and then came on
again. He felt as if he could almost hear the little
devils spitting and hissing in his ears. He grew
more and more irritated by his return to such low
vexations, when he remembered Wall Street and
his life there. He resolved to think of that exclusively,
and to let his life at home shape itself as

<!-- page 232 -->

it would. He would not prejudge any one. He
would give Ph&oelig;be a fair chance to show herself
an affectionate and dutiful wife. If she did not,
it was time enough then to look into matters. As
long as he could keep his temper everything else
would keep. And he resolved to keep it. There
was no hurry.</p>

<p>He found Ph&oelig;be quiet and undemonstrative, as
the day before. She looked even paler, but she
was not as agitated. Something seemed to have
reassured her. A gay little devil pierced Barry's
ear with the whisper that she had had the intelligence
that he and Peyton had not met. The
conversation between the two was rather forced
at dinner. After it, one or two people came in
on business. Ph&oelig;be went up to the baby, and
did not come down again. When Barry, at ten
o'clock, went to his room he found that the baby
had developed a little hoarseness, and Ph&oelig;be in
her wrapper was anxiously bending over him. His
crib was still in the adjoining room, and he was
wide awake. Mary Ann was sleepily making the
last arrangements for the night, and went away
asking if there was anything more wanted in so
tired a tone that only a brute could have had the
heart to keep her up any longer.</p>

<p>"Why don't you call that girl back and let her
take him?" asked Barry, as he saw his wife move
an easy-chair up to the crib and sink down in it.</p>

<p>"She is half asleep already; what would she be

<!-- page 233 -->

by two o'clock?" answered Ph&oelig;be, leaning her
head back wearily and putting her hand through
the crib rails to pat the baby.</p>

<p>"It's all nonsense, this sitting up to watch him.
He has no more croup than I have, and you are
only injuring him by all this coddling. It is simple
mismanagement, and you will soon have your
hands full if you don't make up your mind not to
spoil him so."</p>

<p>The undermining the principles of a baby of
three months made Ph&oelig;be's lip curl, but she did
not reply, and softly pushed shut the door with
her foot after Barry's exit, which was final for the
night.</p>

<p>The baby did not have croup, nor even any
more hoarseness, but he lay awake a long time
and looked at his mother with much interest. At
last he slept; then she crept to the sofa and covered
herself with a shawl, and went to sleep too.
Healthy people cannot stay awake continuously,
even if they are in trouble. Barry probably slept
also, but he got up in a bad humor, and came
down to breakfast later than he had meant to
come. He would again have to take the 9.15
train, and it would be the loss of an hour in Wall
Street, which he did not like. He rather longed
to be in Wall Street again, to get out of himself
and his fretting doubts.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">A BUTTON OFF.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the dining-room Ph&oelig;be was waiting for him.
She sat by the fire reading the paper, but when
he came in she got up without speaking and went
across the room to ring the bell. The cook
brought the breakfast, but Ph&oelig;be put it upon
the table herself, moving about the room silently.
Barry was not in the habit of thinking of her
beauty, but he furtively studied it now while he
pretended to read his paper. He could see what
those old duffers meant; she was very different
from ordinary women. He thought at that moment
he would have preferred a wife who would
have commanded less general attention. But out
of humor as he was, he was just enough to remember
that it was not her fault that she was striking-looking,
and that he must put her standing with
the old duffers out of the question and confine
himself to her relations with Peyton, which was
his only quarrel with her at the present moment.</p>

<p>Breakfast was very quiet. Mary Ann had been
left up-stairs with the baby, and the cook drew
the line of her concessions at waiting on the table,

<!-- page 235 -->

so Ph&oelig;be quietly left her seat and changed Barry's
plate for him, and got him hot cakes from the
pantry, where the cook had brought them, and
"waited" upon him without any sense of degradation.
It was what she had been used to doing
all her life at home, besides cooking the breakfast
and sometimes making the fire when the "hired
man" overslept, and it was in no way a trial to
her.</p>

<p>But in his present condition of ill-humor it was
gall and wormwood to Barry to see her doing it,
and being reminded of the different social place
which she had occupied. It seemed to make all
his doubts possible to recall the past. He rather
curtly told her he wished she would engage another
servant at once, and have things a little "in
order." She said, "Very well," and flushed painfully. 
It was difficult to imagine things in better
order than they were, except in the matter of
service. Probably no man in Marrowfat had sat
down to a better breakfast or a daintier looking
table. The whole house was a miracle of neatness.
Ph&oelig;be had only this outlet for her restless
misery. She had not allowed herself an hour
of idleness yesterday, she had promised herself
this solace again to-day; she literally could not
sit still and think. Now she must go out and get
another servant, who would take this occupation
away from her. There was no longer any need
for economy, if what Barry had told her was true.

<!-- page 236 -->

She wished it were not true. All the good that
she could possibly have been to him was wasted
if he were to be rich.</p>

<p>After breakfast Barry went into the hall and
brought in his ulster: a button had come off. He
hesitated to ask Ph&oelig;be to do anything for him in
his present humor, but he said, "I wish you'd tell
Mary Ann to put this button on at once."</p>

<p>She took the coat and went into the library,
and from a corner closet took out her work-basket
and opened it.</p>

<p>"You'll have to hurry," he said, ungraciously,
following her.</p>

<p>She evidently meant to, for her ringers shook a
little as she hunted for the thread and thimble.
The black thread she wanted was not there: she
laid down the coat, and went quickly up-stairs to
get it. Barry glanced at the clock and saw there
was plenty of time. He knew that she would
hurry. He walked uneasily around the room.
His eye fell on the open work-basket which she
had left. A letter lay face downward in it. He
gave it a snip with his fingers and turned it over.
His heart seemed to turn over sharply as he saw
the writing. It was Peyton's, and the letter was
addressed to Ph&oelig;be. The clerk in the post-office
must have been in the devil's employ, for the clear
stamp on it glared up in his very face. There
was no ambiguity. It was mailed in the city,
Station A, at ten o'clock the day before; the

<!-- page 237 -->

last thing Peyton did, probably, before he took the
eleven o'clock limited express for Washington.
Barry did not touch the letter after he turned it
over with his finger. He stood and looked at it
till he heard Ph&oelig;be's step on the stair, and then
he turned his back and looked out of the window.
She hurriedly entered, and he heard her swift
needle drawn in and out of the coat. But he
heard something else. He heard her crush down
the lid on her basket. That roused the dumb
devil in him into speech. He turned to her just
as, having fastened and cut the thread, she held
the coat out to him. His eye fell on the basket;
it was covered, and she had pushed it, accidentally
or otherwise, a little out of sight.</p>

<p>"I see you are corresponding with Peyton Edwards,"
he said. "I don't ask any explanation,
but I leave you to judge whether it would be wise
to offer one."</p>

<p>He paused and stood looking at her, a dark fury
in his eye. She did not raise her eyes nor attempt
to speak.</p>

<p>"I don't ask an explanation," he said, slowly,
"because between husband and wife, in ordinary
circumstances, it would be an insult. But I suppose
one would hardly say that our circumstances
are ordinary. I don't think that a woman who
has once given the world ground to doubt her discretion
can complain if she is warned to be at
least decently careful in her conduct."</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

With this stab he turned and left the room.
The hat-stand was just outside the door. He did
not omit because of his wrath to brush his hat,
select his cane, take out his gloves. Not a sound
came from within. He was too furiously angry to
trust himself to glance back. He held the hall-door
open for an instant, said, "You need not wait
dinner for me to-night," shut it sharply, and was
gone.</p>

<p>If he had looked back, he might not have gone
so quickly. Even very healthy people can come
pretty near fainting when they are stabbed deep
enough. The poor young woman's face turned
ashy white. She leaned back in the chair in
which she had been sitting upright. It is doubtful
whether for a few moments she knew clearly
what had happened. It was a whole half hour
before she got up from her chair, and seemed
to try her strength by walking once or twice
across the floor. She sat down again, evidently
waiting for the physical ability to do what her
not-baffled mind proposed. It was not long in returning
to her. She had apparently been coming
to some decision, which was stimulated by a glance
at the clock. She got up, took her work-basket,
one or two books that lay on the table, and glanced
around the room in search of something else she
wanted. She rang the bell, and the cook came.</p>

<p>"Mary Ann's forever about coming down to
her breakfast," said this functionary, out of humor.</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

"Yes," said Ph&oelig;be, whose voice sounded as if
she had not used it for a good while. "I am going
up-stairs, and I'll send her down to you. It's my
fault. When she comes, help her bring up the
smallest of the two trunks that stand near the
door of the lumber room. I am going away rather
suddenly, and shall have to take her with me.
You will have to get along for a day or so alone.
There won't be any dinner to get to-night. You
may give me my luncheon at half-past twelve.
Don't let Mary Ann waste any time down-stairs."</p>

<p>The sudden marching orders delighted Mary
Ann, and were not unpleasing even to the cook,
who loved a return to her ancient solitary reign
occasionally. Ph&oelig;be locked herself into her room.
The baby slept. With swift hands she assorted
the contents of wardrobes, drawers, and closets.
Her brain must have worked with great rapidity,
for the work she did between ten and half-past
twelve o'clock was very considerable. She never
seemed to pause or doubt, or have a misgiving or
a regret. Mary Ann was a little afraid of her,
she was so quick and her eyes shone so, that was
the only drawback to her pleasure in the unexpected
outing.</p>

<p>A little after twelve Ph&oelig;be sent Mary Ann
down to bring her luncheon to her. She glanced
around the rooms. They were in perfect order.
The trunks stood packed and strapped. The
baby in his fresh dress lay happy in his crib, his

<!-- page 240 -->

cloak and cap and veil lying on the bed ready to
put on. Ph&oelig;be went to a drawer in her wardrobe,
took out a roll of bills and counted them over: here
she showed her only sign of perturbation or distress.
The use of money suggested a field of anxiety
to her to which she was not accustomed. Her
hands shook, and she went over them again with
agitation. Yes, forty-seven dollars. That was all
right. It had seemed a good sum to her when she
had counted on it for some little indulgence. <i>Now</i>
it was doubtful whether it would go very far. It
was a secret hoard. She had never told Barry of
it. It was a legacy, and she felt sure he would
laugh at the idea of a legacy of forty-seven dollars.
An old aunt had died since she came away from
home, who had left in her will a sum of money to
be divided between her nieces and nephews. The
dividend was not princely, to be sure, but it had
given a good deal of satisfaction in the remote
country homes to which it had found its way, and
it had been a ray of light, a rope of safety, a beacon
of hope to poor Ph&oelig;be that morning when
she had first remembered it. She had blessed
Aunt Abby's memory many times that dark day.
She took out another purse, that in which she kept
the ordinary money, for household purposes and
all that, and taking out from it a little key and
some small memoranda, wrapped it in paper with
the change left in it, and put it in her drawer.
She forced herself to eat some luncheon when it

<!-- page 241 -->

was brought: her manner had a resolution in it, as
if something external to herself were carrying her
forward. The cab came while she was still trying
to eat. Mary Ann, very much excited by the prospect
of adventure, caught up the baby and began
to put on his cloak. There certainly was not a
moment to lose.</p>

<p>When, a few moments later, Ph&oelig;be passed over
the threshold of her husband's house, and shut
the door after her, a bright spot burned on each
cheek, but nothing in her eyes or manner indicated
that she felt the deep significance of what
she was doing, or was overcome either by sorrow
for what was past or by terror for what was to
come. The baby, in his wide-eyed unconsciousness,
gazed out of the carriage window at which
his nurse was dandling him, and showed neither
interest nor apprehension of the fact that he had
turned his back upon the only legitimate home
that the world offered to him.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">HAGAR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the second night after Ph&oelig;be's flight
from home. Midnight was just striking from the
city clocks. From the fifth story of a great hotel
she looked down upon the gas-lights far below her
in the streets. There was a dull, slow rain against
the pane; a mist filled the space between her and
the gaslights below, and above it was all dark.
Mary Ann, no longer in high spirits, slept on a
little cot beside the bed in which the baby lay.
The room was small, and hot, and littered with the
contents of the open trunks. There was no shade
for the little flaring jet of gas; there was no glow
in the little ashen fire which had made the air so
suffocating. There was discomfort and homelessness
in every inch of the cheerless place.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be sat down by the oval white marble table,
and pushing a little space free put her elbows on
it, and leaned her face down on her hands. Yes,
it was true,&mdash;something must be done, something
promptly, or she had failed. In her lap lay her
porte-monnaie, and in it were the remains of the
fast-melting forty-seven dollars. Her ignorance of

<!-- page 243 -->

traveling expenses had made it a shock to her to
discover that she could not get far away from home
with that amount of money. Here they were only
at Albany, and there would be but thirteen dollars
left after the hotel bill was paid, if indeed
that did not swell up and even swallow the thirteen
dollars. It made her feel faint whenever she
remembered the bill and thought of the possibility
of its exceeding her estimate of its amount. There
had been so many things that she had not thought
of,&mdash;the porter, the express, the fire, and last,
not least, the doctor for the baby. The hoarseness
had come back, and she had had a great terror of
his being ill where she could not get a doctor. It
was on account of this attack that they had not
pushed on at once. Evidently they could not
travel very fast with a delicate young baby, and
evidently they could not travel very far with
such a slender purse. No, Ph&oelig;be admitted to herself,
a crisis had come: her first plan must be
abandoned; she must do what she could, and not
what she would. The fiery strength with which
she had started had long since failed her; her purpose
was not weak, but it was leaden, and sunk
her to the earth. She moaned as she laid her
head down on her arms upon the marble. Oh, that
she and her baby were indeed at rest; indeed hidden
out of sight! There was no rest, there was no
hiding; she could not get far enough away from
people's eyes. How they looked at her wherever

<!-- page 244 -->

she went; how impossible it was to disappear! It
had seemed so easy when she had planned it. It
was like a nightmare,&mdash;eyes, eyes, wherever she
turned, following her, meeting her, looking down
upon her from heights and up at her from depths.
She felt as if Hagar and Ishmael must be written
on their faces. She had made sure, when once
they got away from the little strip of territory
where her name and face were known, that she
could sink out of notice, and be no more an object
of interest to any one. But porter, hall-boy,
waiter, gazed; commercial travelers, clerks, men
and women, old and young, shot glances, inquiring,
admiring, deriding, what not. How did she
happen to be traveling alone? How did she happen
to have such appealing eyes and such an agitated
manner when anybody attempted to get speech of
her? She was too handsome and well dressed to
be unnoticed; the baby was appareled like a little
prince, and was beautiful. Mary Ann thought
the interest they awakened very flattering. She
did not fail to encourage it as far as she was able.</p>

<p>It was no use: slipping away and not being seen
was impossible. The whole thing was at an end.
All she could do was to cheat fate by changing
her mind. She had been awake so many nights
she was almost like ordinary women for nervousness
and unreasonableness. She wanted to cry,
but she was too frightened, too close drawn into
herself; a kind word would have broken her

<!-- page 245 -->

down, but that did not seem likely to come, seeing
Mary Ann was rather afraid to speak to her, and
the baby did not know how.</p>

<p>It was not her way to sit down and think over
things forever. She had been cabined and confined 
in this little room so long she had been
forced to do more of it than was natural to her.
Now she must end it and resolve upon something.
She got up, walked restlessly to the window
and back; gazed down from the dizzy height
into the narrow misty street below, then to the
baby's bed, and then back again. By this time
her resolution was taken. She went to a trunk,
pulled it out, and began to rearrange and repack it
carefully. A few stitches were needed on some
of the baby's clothes. She took out needle and
thread, and stood close by the little gas jet and
mended them. Her own traveling-dress she
brushed carefully, and she even pulled out the fingers
of her gloves and examined them. It was
plain she was afraid her occupation would not last
her the night out; she was quite right. At four
o'clock she had to lie down beside the baby and
consider that there was nothing else to do. She
felt a shuddering horror of the dark and silence
and covered up her eyes and tried to get asleep.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dawn she waked Mary Ann
and told her they were going away; she must
get up and dress. She dressed herself, and went
down to get her breakfast in the great, gray,

<!-- page 246 -->

empty dining room, where the million subtle scents
of as many savory meals slew appetite and filled
one to repletion. One or two sleepy, stolid-looking
travelers were breakfasting; the waiters seemed
to blink and their steps to resound in the bare,
empty room. The clerk at the desk where she
went to pay her bill looked sleepy, too, and indifferent.
The bill was not quite as large as she
had thought possible; she had fifteen dollars instead
of thirteen wherewith to meet the world.
There were yet so many things to think of,&mdash;the
hall-boy, the luncheon, the railway tickets, the
chamber-maid.</p>

<p>While Mary Ann went down to get her breakfast,
and the baby lay on the bed and amiably
shook his rattle in the air, she counted out a certain
sum and laid it by itself, hurried into a
valise the few possessions of Mary Ann, put that
young woman's bonnet and cloak beside it, and
taking out her watch counted the moments till she
came back.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are late," she said, in a voice
in which there was a little agitation audible.
"Your train goes in fifteen minutes. Put your
bonnet on as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>Mary Ann looked bewildered, but obeyed.</p>

<p>"The baby," she said. "Shan't I dress him
before I put my cloak on?"</p>

<p>"No," answered her mistress, looking at her
watch, and not at the woman. "You are to go

<!-- page 247 -->

home this morning. I&mdash;have thought&mdash;that is&mdash;it
seems best&mdash;for you to take this first train
to New York. When you get there you can find
your way easily to the Marrowfat train. Any
policeman will tell you, but I've written it all
down here in case you forget anything. Here is
the money for your ticket; there are crackers in
the bag for your luncheon."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;said Mary Ann, too dazed and helpless
to button her cloak&mdash;"the baby&mdash;who is to
mind the baby"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," said Ph&oelig;be, desperately, putting the
bag into her limp hands and almost pushing her
towards the door, "don't stop to think about the
baby. You really haven't a moment to spare.
The hall-boy is waiting outside to take you to the
depot and show you where to get your ticket.
Remember to keep it in your porte-monnaie. And
here is your return ticket to Marrowfat from the
city. Put that in the other side. There, good-by;
you really must not stay another minute."</p>

<p>Mary Ann cast a mute, distracted look towards
her little charge on the bed, but had not the composure
necessary to ask for a last embrace of him.
She grasped the bag and the porte-monnaie, and
impelled by the stronger will of her mistress went
out of the door without another word. Ph&oelig;be
gave the waiting hall-boy directions about the
train and the car in which he was to put the pliant
Mary Ann. It was all done so promptly and

<!-- page 248 -->

so assuredly that the poor girl did not get her
breath till she was in the cars and fairly on her
way to the city. There was but one form of
words which came to her relief. "Well-I-never,"
she began to murmur at Greenbush, and at Spuyten
Duyvil she had not got any farther, but only
emphasized the expression of the same idea, if
Well-I-never may be said to be the expression of
an intelligent idea.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">THE COOK ASSISTS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barry</span> had said he would not come home that
evening; he was even more vindictive than he
promised, for he did not come home on the following.
It was a satisfaction to him to know that he
could in this silent way express his feelings of indignation.
He shrunk from another interview.
He felt ashamed of himself for what in his anger
he had said to his wife, but yet in a way he was
ashamed of feeling so. He said to himself that
he ought to have said more, that he could not
punish her enough; and yet his heart told him he
had done a cruel and unmanly thing when he
taunted her with his own wrong-doing. He was by
turns furiously jealous and sickeningly repentant.</p>

<p>But away from Marrowfat the whole thing
weakened and lost coloring. He hated the idea of
going back and having the uncomfortable sensations
revived. He was not pacified, but he was
diverted. His natural kindliness of nature was
glad of the reprieve; his habitual feeling of what
others owed to him only consented to it as a reprieve.
When after the pressure of an exciting

<!-- page 250 -->

day in Wall Street he concluded to go up town
and dine with a friend, he thought to himself he
was acting very handsomely in not locking himself
up in a hotel room and brooding over his
wrongs, or even blowing his own or Peyton's
brains out. He felt few men would have done
better. He even went to the theatre that night;
and though there was a weight on his spirits that
made him vaguely uncomfortable, there was no
noticeable depression in his manner or expression.</p>

<p>When it approached evening on the following
day he found himself instinctively dreading the
renewal of the disagreeable experiences which going
home involved. He knew that with it he
must take up matters where he had laid them
down. He did not say to himself that he doubted
his doubts or was suspicious of his suspicions when
he was away from Marrowfat, but it was about
the truth. Still, when he thought of it he grew
angry again. He yielded to the importunities of a
friend who urged his staying with him that night.
He wrote a dispatch to Ph&oelig;be and then tore it up.
It would be well for her to look for him, and she
must bear her disappointment as best she might;
it would be a wholesome lesson to her, and would
show her what even the faintest disloyalty to him
would always cost her. He grew angry as he
allowed himself to think of it; he always grew
angry when he thought of it; his only safety
was in keeping it out of his mind, and the only

<!-- page 251 -->

way to do that was to have his mind full of other
things. Wall Street answered very well during
the day; and the club and the theatre and two or
three old friends stood him in stead for the evening.
But the night, "the dead, unhappy night;"
he was not so successful in the matter of the
night.</p>

<p>When the third afternoon of his absence wore
away to train-time he had many misgivings, but
he had begun to feel he had carried the punishment
far enough, and that it would be unmanly
to be longer unforgiving, or at least unbending.
And at his heart there was a little uneasiness
lest his silence should have caused a wound too
deep to be healed by the palliation which he was
prepared to offer. Yes, he would go home; a
train later than usual was the compromise with
his pride which he decided on. She would have
one full hour of thinking that he was not coming.
It would be very wholesome.</p>

<p>This train brought him to Marrowfat a few
minutes before seven. There were none of his
friends on it, so he had the time for reflection.
It was dark and sloppy when he got out of the
cars, feeling sore and ill-used, but yet in a certain
sense relieved by being here, with no chance for
retreat possible. It was not pleasant to meet
Ph&oelig;be under the circumstances, but it was pleasant
to feel he was manly enough to do the right
thing, whether it was what he liked or not. Self-approval

<!-- page 252 -->

was very necessary to Barry; when this
failed him he collapsed. Splash, splash, through
the mud,&mdash;phaugh! what a night for a man in
his social standing to be coming out to a dreary
country home! What a life he led! What privations
he had suffered for the past year! And all
for the sake of&mdash;what, and who? Not many
men would have done as he had done, as he was
doing; certainly, not many men. When he
thought of the luxury and ease, and, what was
more important to him, the dignity and good
form, with which his life would have been conducted
but for this marriage, he did not grow bitter;
he grew better tempered, because he thought
so well of himself. He said to himself, The money
is coming, and that will restore everything, and
all will yet be well if Ph&oelig;be will but prove herself
all right, and explain away the dark circumstances
that he was not to blame for demanding
an explanation of. As he neared the house he
began to feel an assurance that she would make
such an explanation.</p>

<p>The gate was closed, which he thought unnecessary.
He pushed it open, and went through the
damp grass to see that it was fastened back and
would not come shut again. He looked up to the
windows of the rooms they occupied on the third
floor. There was no light. Neither was there
one on the first floor. All was as dark as if no
one lived in the house. This did not please him.

<!-- page 253 -->

People knew he was at home again, and it did not
look well for a man who was something very important
in a syndicate to be living like a journeyman
tailor in a back shop. Ph&oelig;be's economies had
become detestable to him. He knocked the mud
off his boots, and fumbled about for the knob of
the door. The door of course was locked: he did
not blame her for that, but he had to hunt again
for the bell handle, which when found he pulled
very sharply once or twice. After an unreasonable
time of waiting, a faint glimmer appeared in
the fan-light over the door, and some one said,
"Who's there?"</p>

<p>Barry said who was, in a very irritated tone.
Then an exclamation, and some one began undoing
bolts and bars which seemed to have no end.
He rather uncivilly pushed against the door before
the last chain was dropped. The cook said
she was doing her best, if he would please wait a
minute longer. He waited, not because he pleased,
but because he could not help himself. The cook
stood back and let him pass, and set down her
candle on the floor while she replaced a few of the
household defenses.</p>

<p>"Why don't you have a light in the hall?" he
said, angrily, setting down his hat and taking off
his coat.</p>

<p>The cook said she was not expecting anybody,
and it did not seem worth while to be burning
out gas for nothing. He threw down his coat and

<!-- page 254 -->

pushed open the library door: there was no light
nor fire there; it felt very cold and damp, as if the
furnace fire had not been lighted for some days.
By this time the cook had fastened the door and
taken her candle up and set it on the table.</p>

<p>"You'll be wantin' somethin' to eat," she began.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he returned, shortly.</p>

<p>"There isn't a happoth in the house," she said,
well pleased that her economies should be recognized.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, sharply, turning
to her. "Has Mrs. Crittenden had her dinner?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crittenden!" ejaculated the woman,
throwing up her hands. "Why, she's been gone
these three days! Bless you, has anything happened
her a-gittin' to you? Why, I made sure
she and you was having a foine time together in
the city, after her bein' so lonely all the winter.
And hearin' no word from either of yez, I never
laid in nothin' from the butcher nor the grocer,
nor the iceman even. I just let 'em come and let
'em go, and scold and fume as much as they liked.
Do yez live on nothin' yerself, they said. I told
'em it was none of their business what I lived on
as long as I done my dooty."</p>

<p>Barry's back was turned to the woman, and she
did not see how pale he grew at her first words.
Her final ones (and a great many had intervened,
of no great literary or statistic value) seemed to

<!-- page 255 -->

demand some kind of a response. She could put
some tea, anything, on the table, and send Mary
Ann up-stairs to tell him when it was ready.</p>

<p>"Mary Ann!" she cried, throwing up her
hands again in genuine amazement. "What is
the man talking of! You didn't think she'd
left the baby behind her, and her a-nursin' of him
yet! Why, Mary Ann's went with her. You
hadn't been an hour out of the house when such
a pullin' out of trunks and a packin' up of clothes
begun as never was. And they was off in the
noon train. Mary Ann, indeed! Why, Mary Ann
was as pleased as Punch, and never so much as
passed a remark about my being left alone, and
not a soul in the house day in day out, to speak a
livin' word to."</p>

<p>All this time Barry was walking, dazed and
speechless, up the stairs. The woman's voice rang
after him with clear distinctness in the still and
empty house. He longed to get to his own room,
to turn the key, to think, and to adjust himself
to this unexpected situation. She went on talking
about his tea, about her economies, about
Mary Ann. He shut the door when he got up-stairs,
and struck a match and lighted the gas.
There was a chair near him, and he sat down in
it; possibly he felt a little weak and ill for the
moment. Of all the surprises of his life, this was
the most complete. He did not know exactly
what he thought or felt. He did not for a while

<!-- page 256 -->

ask himself what it meant; he only said over and
over to himself, Could it possibly be true? Later
on he was racked with the doubt whether her going
meant guilt or indignation. But he had not
yet begun to weigh things, to decide, to define.
All he could say or think was surmounted by
amazement. Ph&oelig;be gone, the child gone, the one
spot on earth of which he felt himself in sure and
stable possession a blank to him. No word, nothing?
It was impossible.</p>

<p>After a while he got up and began to look
about for a letter. He had not asked the woman,
but if she had had any message she would have
given it to him. Indeed, as she had thought they
were together, there could have been no message.
He began vaguely and abstractedly; he grew feverish
and frightened as he went on. He pulled
open drawers and closets; he searched in boxes
and on shelves. All were in order; everything
showed a recent definite arrangement. Everything
told one story. The going was final. If
there had been haste in her going it was directed
by an intention so definite that nothing escaped
it. Of the child's possessions there was nothing
left that could be packed into a trunk; only the
crib and a chair or two of his remained in either
of the rooms. Of Ph&oelig;be's own, everything was
gone that had been hers before marriage; everything
was left that had been given her by her
husband or bought with his money&mdash;gloves half

<!-- page 257 -->

worn, handkerchiefs, veils, scraps of lace and ribbon,
a new dress or two, all arranged in perfect
order, and laid by themselves as if with gravest
intention. In her dressing-table drawer lay a
package containing her wedding-ring and the few
pieces of jewelry he had ever given her. It was
not even addressed to him. In another package
was her porte-monnaie and little account-book,
with a hurried entry in pencil on the day of her
going. The change in the pocket-book agreed
with the statement of household expenses up to
that day. He looked through her writing-desk.
There was nothing there but paper, pens, stamps,
some bills, not a scrap of her writing, not a letter
that belonged to her except&mdash;the slim package of
Barry's own while he was away.</p>

<p>Could all this have been the work of three
hours? Was it possible that she had had no intention
of going away from him till he had said
what he did to her that morning? Barry did not
know what he believed, what he apprehended.
He walked up and down the rooms feeling stunned
and helpless, like a person recovering from a prostrating
illness, or getting over a long debauch.
He felt feeble in will, weak in judgment, incapable
of continuous thought.</p>

<p>By and by the cook came up, bringing a tray
of things for him to eat. She made an exclamation
at the coldness of the room, and went down
on her knees upon the hearth and scraped together

<!-- page 258 -->

the remnants of some half-consumed wood,
and succeeded in lighting them.</p>

<p>"It's no matter," he said, wanting to get rid of
her.</p>

<p>But she saw he was in a great deal of trouble,
and she was clumsily sorry for him. She had
liked her mistress very well, but, like a true Irish-woman,
she liked her master very much better.
So she set out his tea with considerable clatter,
and made a nice fire, and lighted a lamp, and tried
to cheer him up with a good deal of rambling conversation,
which he did not seem to hear. Indeed,
she was surprised at the things which she made
bold to say to him, and which he did not appear
to resent or even understand. He had always inspired
her with much respectful admiration; now
her principal feeling was that of admiring pity,
and every one knows to what length Irish admiring
pity is capable of going. He humbly wished she
would go away. He did not know what made her
stay; he could not eat anything she had brought
him. He had swallowed the coffee and felt a little
nerved up by it, but not to the point of asking
her questions which he knew beforehand she
could not answer. He looked so wretched that
she could hardly tear herself away from the sight,
and yet was so irresponsive that she was finally
obliged to do it. She took the tray away, and,
promising the fire a little more wood in the course
of half an hour, went down the dark stairs into

<!-- page 259 -->

the dim kitchen, filled with the emotions that we
seek in the drama. While our servants have to
go to funerals and are driven to make the most of
fires and robberies and their friends' misfortunes,
we go to the theatre to get the same sensations, or
find them in highly-wrought fiction with even less
effort. It is not the least trying of the inequalities
of fortune. The cook could no more have
given up the contemplation of the third-story
drama than you or I would be likely to give up
voluntarily the contemplation of Salvini in the
third act of Othello. She soon found an excuse
for tiptoeing up the stairs again, and tapping at
the door of the little study.</p>

<p>"A letter, sir, that's after comin' from the
mail. May be you'd be wantin' it."</p>

<p>She put it into his hands at the door, and so
arranged matters that he could not very well shut
it in her face; by which means she commanded
for the next ten minutes a certain though imperfect
view of the stage and its agitated actor. If
one cannot have a front balcony seat, one is sometimes
thankful to catch a glimpse between the
flies. Barry forgot his audience; he devoured the
direction on the letter with kindling eyes. It was
addressed to Ph&oelig;be, and was in the abhorred
handwriting of his childhood's friend. The postmark
was Washington, the date was obliterated.
He ripped the envelope open with no paltering of
conscience about the act. It read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Ph&oelig;be</span>,&mdash;I reached this place last
evening. I leave to-morrow for St. Louis. A letter
addressed to the Southern Hotel will find me
there till after Tuesday. Then my next address
will be the St. Charles, New Orleans.</p>

<p class="right">Yours sincerely, <span class="smcap">Peyton Edwards</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>This letter acted like the application of a battery
to a comatose person. Barry's eyes seemed
to burn holes in the paper as he looked at it. He
clinched his hands, ground his fine white teeth together,
uttered some passionate exclamations, and
walked about the room angrily. At this moment
there was a ringing at the kitchen bell, which
seemed to the cook too cruel an interruption to be
borne. She was consoled only by the thought
that it might be another letter, equally electric,
or at any rate that she would not be long away.
She would make short work of any ordinary
visitor of her own, and would return on the
legitimate and flat-footed errand of bringing up
more wood. So she tiptoed down in all haste, and
left Barry walking up and down the room quite
unconscious of her interest and attendance. Her
return was flat-footed, breathless, prompt.</p>

<p>"I've come to tell you," she panted, supporting
herself by the door-post, for she was no longer
young, and such rapid journeys up and down
the stairs, not to mention these exciting scenes,
were exhausting to her strength,&mdash;"I've come to

<!-- page 261 -->

tell you Mary Ann's after getting back this
minute."</p>

<p>"Mary Ann!" exclaimed her master, turning
sharply round. "Where"&mdash;and he stopped short,
facing the lean, keen-visaged, curious Irish-woman,
and realizing in an instant the full ignominy of
his position.</p>

<p>The woman dropped her eyes; she was keen
enough to know that he must be ashamed to ask
questions of his servants about his wife. "I
thought you'd likely want to know how she'd
left the mistress and the baby"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, send her up."</p>

<p>"She'll come in a minute; she's sort of upset
like. She ain't used to going about by herself;
she's kind of childish, is Mary Ann. I'll give
her a dish o' tea, and let her rest a bit, and then
mebbe she'll be able to come up."</p>

<p>"She must hurry, then," said Barry, desperately,
"for I'm going out."</p>

<p>This gave the cook a fright, as one would feel,
in the most exciting moment of a tragedy, to
think of the gas being turned off, the curtain
dropped, and the audience told to go about their
business. She hurriedly said Mary Ann would
certainly come up, if he would wait a bit. She'd
see herself that no time was lost about it.</p>

<p>No time <i>was</i> lost about it. In a very short
space, Mary Ann stood before her master in the
doorway of the little study, with the tears scarcely

<!-- page 262 -->

dried upon her cheeks, her bonnet strings untied
and fluttering, her hair agitatedly awry, and her
cloak unbuttoned, but not taken off.</p>

<p>When she saw Mr. Crittenden, she began to
cry afresh; what for, it would be difficult to say.
The sight of her rather unnerved her master; he
hated tears from any source. She was young and
presumably innocent, and she affected him very
differently from the elderly and inquisitive and
most unbeautiful cook. He did not feel the degradation
to be nearly so great to have to learn from
her the last news of his wife. Besides, he had so
constantly seen her with the child in her arms,
she seemed at a little less impossible distance than
the other.</p>

<p>"Well, Mary Ann," he said, suppressing a rising
sob, roused by the thought of the baby and
the sight of her agitation, "don't cry; that won't
do any good. How's&mdash;baby, and where have you
left him?"</p>

<p>That only made her cry the more; what for,
who shall say? For Mary Ann had not been a
very absorbed nurse, and had frequently found
herself much wearied by her duties, and had given
warning more than once. It was a good while before
she could calm herself enough to say when
she had parted from her mistress. Indeed, she
hardly knew where; she had very little memory
for names. She bethought herself at last of the
written directions her mistress had given her, and

<!-- page 263 -->

hunted for them in her pocket, and gave them to
him, a little the worse for much study and consultation
with conductors and policemen and benevolent
persons on the way. They were written
out in Ph&oelig;be's clear, strong hand; even muddle-headed
Mary Ann could sail by such a chart, it
seemed. Barry studied it for a moment.</p>

<p>"When did you go there?" he said.</p>

<p>"To where? To the big hotel, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the hotel in Albany."</p>

<p>"Oh, the day we went away from here; we
got there in the evening. The baby got hoarse,&mdash;that's
the reason we stayed there all next day; she
told the doctor we was in a great hurry, but he
said it wouldn't do to take the baby out."</p>

<p>"Tell me: the day you went away from here,
what did you do till you took the train for Albany?
Did you go anywhere, to any house, or meet any
body anywhere?"</p>

"Oh, we met lots and lots of people everywhere,
but nobody, I think, that spoke to us. We went
right up in a carriage to the depot where that train
started from, and stopped there till it went. The
baby was that good he never fretted onst all the
way a-goin'. You wouldn't have knowed there
was a baby in the train at all."</p>

<p>And Mary Ann began to cry again.</p>

<p>"Well," said Barry, walking up and down the
room, "and while you were at the hotel, did&mdash;did
anybody come to see your mistress?"</p>

<!-- page 264 -->

<p>"No," said Mary Ann.</p>

<p>"Did she send for anybody, write notes, go out
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the girl, rather bewildered.
"She was always takin' care of baby. She was
in the room all the time but when she was down
to her meals. She might have wrote notes while
I was asleep; I can't say as to that."</p>

<p>"And what did she say to you when she told
you to come home?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say nothing but just that."</p>

<p>"And when did you know she meant to send
you back?"</p>

<p>"After I'd got my breakfast, this morning.
She just told me I was to go home, and she give
me my ticket, and there wasn't anything for me
to do, for she'd packed my things up unbeknownst,
and she put the bag into my hand and just whizzed
me off before I knew what it was all about."</p>

<p>And Mary Ann, at the recital of her wrongs,
began to cry again. "And she never told me
whether I was to stay here after I got here, or
whether she didn't want me no more, or anything
about it. She just sent me, that was all. She
might a-told me, I should think."</p>

<p>"And do you know how long she was to stay
at the hotel?"</p>

"I don't think she was goin' to stay at all; I
think she was goin' right away. She had all
packed up the trunks last night while I was asleep.

<!-- page 265 -->

There wasn't anything left out but baby's cloak
and cap."</p>

<p>"What place did she talk about? Where do
you think she meant to go?"</p>

<p>Mary Ann could not remember, though she
tried. She had heard her ask at the office for a
time-table; she had heard the clerk tell her the
hour that a certain morning train would bring her
to a certain place, but the name of the place
she had forgotten. Barry repeated to her many
routes, the names of many cities. At the naming
of Montreal and Canada she showed interest.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if that was it," she said.
And that was as near as Barry could get to assurance
of any kind. He came to a sudden conclusion;
there was no time to be lost; the last train
to the city left the depot in fifteen minutes. When
for the second time that day Mary Ann was treated
to the surprise of a sudden separation from her
employer, she found herself better prepared to
meet it under the sheltering wing of the cook in
the comfortable Crittenden kitchen. Her "Well-I-never"
echoed harmlessly among the pots and
pans of that well-scrubbed region. The cook could
not hear too much of her recent strange adventures;
together they sat up till "all hours" of the
night, and talked "about it goddess and about it,"
till, like their betters, they scarcely knew what was
truth and what was speculation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">RACING AND CHASING ON CANOBIE LEE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barry's</span> first telegram was sent to the hotel at
Albany. He could not tell if she had registered
in her own name or not; but it seemed she had.
In due course of electricity came the intelligence
that Mrs. Crittenden had left the hotel on the
previous morning. His next was to Malden, sent
in the name of one of his clerks, to know if she
were in the place. The answer was prompt. She
was not living there. His third was addressed to
Peyton Edwards, and contained a demand for intelligence
of the whereabouts of his wife. From
Washington came the information that he was not
there; from St. Louis the same. After a couple
of hours of desperation, consultation with detectives,
and all the unwisdom of a maddened man,
a dispatch arrived from Peyton at St. Louis. He
had just reached there, and had found Barry's dispatch.
He knew nothing of Ph&oelig;be; had looked
for a letter from her, but was disappointed. "Try
Malden." An hour after, another: "Try Brixton.
Answer." Another, after another not much
longer interval, evincing the keenest anxiety:</p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>"Let me know at once. Avoid publicity. You
may be sure it will be all right."</p>

<p>It began to be borne in upon Barry's mind that
his wife was not eloping with Peyton Edwards,
though the detectives did not see his grounds for
confidence. If he could have cleared up the mystery
of her possessing money enough to go away,
he would have dismissed the theory of Peyton's
complicity in her going. But her money statements
were so accurate and simple. She had had
no friends to apply to for funds. She had left behind
her every piece of jewelry that would have
brought her anything. If she had gone on the
spur of the taunt he had thrown at her, he could
not account for her having enough money to
make the journey to Albany. If she had had it
long in contemplation, then Peyton was at the
bottom of it. But in his heart, somehow, he felt a
growing conviction that he had sent Ph&oelig;be away,
and that Peyton had not enticed her. He dismissed
the detectives, gorged with his money and
sworn to keep his secret, threw to the winds Wall
Street, Syndicate, and Fortune, boarded the first
train to Albany, and, with a heavy heart, set out
to find her.</p>

<p>At Albany he could strike no clue. The only
thing was to follow the nurse's suggestion and look
for her in Montreal. Then there was simply nothing
to help him. He spent two days in pursuing
phantoms; came back from Canada despairing

<!-- page 268 -->

and angry, with suspicions again aroused against
Peyton. In this state of mind, he hurried to Chicago,
led by a clue chance threw in his way. An
official to whom he spoke in the railway station
remembered a lady, with a child in her arms, buying
a ticket for Chicago some four days ago. He
recollected her perfectly: large, handsome woman.
Could not tell the color of her dress; something
dark. Did not see the child's face; thought it was
asleep; wondered why she did not have a nurse
for it; she looked "smart" enough dressed to have
one. She looked like a lady. She acted as if she
did not want people to see her. She pulled down
her veil when he looked at her. He should know
her in a minute.</p>

<p>Barry kept track of this lady without much
difficulty. She was a noticeable person and did
not want to be noticed. It was very plain she
was getting away from somebody. He traced her
step by step to a third-rate boarding-house in the
outskirts of Chicago, was treated to screams and
hysterics from the other side of a thin partition,
and finally, with many misgivings but with desperate
resolution, forced himself into the presence
of a stout, flashily dressed woman of thirty-two,
with a great deal of frizzed yellow hair, who
swooned with joy to find he was not her pursuing
husband, and who clutched in her arms a sickly
girl of three, apparently the bone of contention
between the ill-assorted pair.</p>

<!-- page 269 -->

<p>After this he had no way to turn. He had
given up all theories, to the one engendered by
this clue, that Ph&oelig;be was on her way to St. Louis
to join Peyton. He telegraphed to his office for
news; was answered by replicas of telegrams of
Peyton's from New Orleans, where he was now
apparently pursuing the even tenor of an honest
way, and where Ph&oelig;be was not likely to be by
any ordinary mode of locomotion, with a croupy
baby in her arms, and with very limited experience
in making connections and studying out
schedules. Peyton's dispatches were not suave.
They were rather peremptory; but the language
was ambiguous enough not to be readily interpreted
at the office. He wanted to be answered;
he advised Malden; he almost demanded discretion.
Barry sulkily put the dispatches in his
pocket; he had no intention of giving any answer
to them, but because there was no other plan put
before him he accepted the counsel they contained,
bought a ticket to Malden, and, haggard
and worn-looking, took his seat in the train that
with many changes and turns and much provincial
deliberation would bring him to Malden by
the coming on of dusk.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch22">

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">GRAY SHINGLES ON A WET DAY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spring rains had swollen the brooks and
gullied the roads about Malden. The mud was
deep, the air was raw. Ph&oelig;be got out of the train
with a sickening weariness of the dreary scene.
It was not raining, it was just "misting;" and
though it was not cold enough to prevent the snow
left along the edges of the fields and in sheltered
spots from melting rapidly, the air seemed more
chill than winter. The stage-driver even walked
up and down the platform, and beat his heavily
gloved hands together to keep them warm. He
opened the door of the stage for Ph&oelig;be with a
little nod of recognition. He did not look more
interested and surprised than if she had been
away a week instead of a year. She had not
wanted to make a sensation; she had longed to
steal back in the night and not be seen. But this
coming back by midday, and being nodded at as
if it were not the deepest wretchedness that had
brought her,&mdash;this was even worse than active
curiosity. It seemed to her such a note of the
life to which she had returned, stagnant, commonplace,

<!-- page 271 -->

uneventful, low. She had gone away from
it in bitterness; she had come back to it with
loathing. Nothing but the direst necessity had
forced her to it. If there had been any other
shelter for her she would have taken it. But
these few days of battling for life among strangers,
with a weight of helpless care in her arms, had
cured her of her bold hope and steadfastness. For
the child's sake she submitted to give up, to seek
the only refuge that was open to her, and steeled
herself to endure the most repugnant life she
could imagine. She felt beforehand the taunts of
her neighbors; she knew that she must work hard,
live low, forget the past, endure the present, renounce
hope for the future.</p>

<p>No wonder that her face was stern and set as
they jolted along the muddy roadway that led
from the station to the little village. The driver
looked back askance at her, and concluded not to
make any conversation; he leaned forward on his
elbows, hummed a Moody and Sankey tune, and
drove on stolidly. There was no other passenger.
Ph&oelig;be had the back seat and the "buffaloes"
quite to herself. The baby was wrapped in a
traveling-shawl; the fine cloak had gone two or
three days ago to a greedy shop-woman, who paid
her a third of what it cost. Ph&oelig;be did not look
any too grand to be riding in the Malden stage.
Her dark dress had a little mud on it, and the indefinable
shade of careless and constant wear.

<!-- page 272 -->

She had wound a blue veil around her bonnet to
keep it from the rain.</p>

<p>It was a strange coming back, she thought,
looking at the baby in his crumpled cap sleeping
on her arm, which ached. She had sometimes had
dreams of how she would return to Malden with
her beautiful boy and her devoted husband. She
had felt it was not altogether unpardonable that she
should have such dreams, considering her humiliations.
She had fancied how, in some prosperous
future summer, they would drive over the hills
in an open carriage, making all the journey from
Marrowfat in that luxurious way; she had even
seen in her mind's eye the sash and the sailor
hat, and the soft brown curls of the pretty boy;
there should be a maid in a white cap, and a man
possibly with a silk hat and a band around it and
a buckle. She did not go the length of a livery,
but the velvet band would be so possible, even
if they had grown only moderately prosperous.
Ph&oelig;be was economical even in her dreams. She
had always had the picture in her mind of their
arrival at the gate of her little old home. It was
always towards evening of a June day that they
arrived: everything about the house and yard was
looking its best; her mother, proud and smiling,
was standing at the gate to welcome them; the
little cavalcade filled the roadway, Barry, handsome,
merry, and sunburned, with a dog or two
about his feet, stooped down, uncovered, to kiss his

<!-- page 273 -->

mother-in-law; the man stood at the horses'
heads; the maid held up the boy, who shouted in
delight; and always at this moment passed Mary
Carpenter and Letitia Gregg, who had said the
bitterest and hardest things about her.</p>

<p>And <i>this</i> was the way she was coming home:
outcast and forlorn, and alone forever but for the
baby who lay a dead weight in her tired arms;
the June evening, the fine carriage, the attendants,
found their fulfillment in the damp April drizzle,
the lumbering old stage, the grizzled, psalm-singing
driver. Poor Ph&oelig;be! she could not cry, she did
not want to cry. She was hard and bitter and
resentful.</p>

<p>She knew every barn and hay-rick they passed.
That pump, this stile,&mdash;she had not thought of
them since she went away, but they were as familiar
as if she had been seeing them every day. The
dreariness, the weariness, of it; and underneath
all the wound that had brought her back to it.</p>

<p>In the drive from the station to the village,
Peterson's half-witted boy tending the cattle at
the farmyard gate, and old Nancy Briggs wrapped
in the faded plaid shawl that she remembered so
long, were the only human beings that they
passed. The village was silent as a graveyard.
The "store" door was shut, but a mist on the
panes of its one window and a "team" hitched
outside showed that the tide of commerce was still
flowing through the little hamlet. Half a dozen

<!-- page 274 -->

silent, spitting, steaming male figures were undoubtedly
seated around its sulky stove. The
driver stopped at another rival mercantile house;
this was new since Ph&oelig;be went away. Here the
mail-bag was left; a small board over the door said
Post Office. The man stayed a good while inside;
he came out puffing at a very bad cigar, the smoke
of which floated back into the stage for the remainder
of the way, and made Ph&oelig;be ill and angry.</p>

<p>The last house was passed that lay between the
village and her old home. Her heart began to
beat, and the tears that had refused to come for
so many suffering days were gathering in her
eyes. Beneath all the revolt at coming home and
the certainty of misery there, there had been a
yearning to throw herself into her mother's arms
and weep out her despair. She knew that the
comfort would be short-lived; that more wretchedness
than solace would come from telling out her
griefs to one of so different a temperament from
her own. But the impulse was deep as nature
and old as Holy Writ: "as one whom his mother
comforteth."</p>

<p>It required all her force of will to keep back
the flood of tears that the mere thought of meeting
her mother brought. The horses climbed the
little ascent slowly; Ph&oelig;be scarcely dared look
out. At last, with a jolt, the stage stopped before
the gate, and the driver called out Whoa! in a loud
voice intended more to rouse the inmates of the

<!-- page 275 -->

house than to check the horses, who scarcely
needed any invitation to stop.</p>

<p>The house stood near the road; below this road,
in front, the land dropped away suddenly, and a
wide stretch of pasture land, several miles perhaps,
lay out in view, bounded by bare-looking
hills, now covered with mist, in the distance. At
the right of the house lay a patch of garden; adjoining
it the barn and out-houses. At the back
of it the hill rose so suddenly that the house lost
a story in consequence, and was built up against
its base. The hill was covered with bushes and
trees, now dripping and bare and brown. The
house looked very old and very small; it was unpainted,
and its gray shingles were dark with the
soaking rain. It did not look out of repair; two
or three great stems of vines mounted to its roof,
and in summer no doubt made it very pretty. A
stone wall surmounted by a low paling separated
it from the road; three or four steps led up from
the road to the gate, which was also low, not more
than two feet high. The shrubs and flower-beds
were perhaps nicely kept in summer; they were
not much to look at now. A little path led to
the front door, but it was evidently unused. A
line of boards lay towards the kitchen door, indicating
that as the usual way of entrance.</p>

<p>The driver pulled open the stage door. Ph&oelig;be,
grasping the child in her arms, got out, giving
a hurried look towards the house. No one had

<!-- page 276 -->

appeared at the call of the driver; everything
seemed so deadly still. You could hear the breathing
of the tired horses and the creaking of the old
stage with their slight motion. She pushed open
the low gate; it sagged and stuck at a certain
point as she remembered it did when she was a
little child. She hurried up to the kitchen door
and opened it without allowing herself time to
think again.</p>

<p>The room was all still and warm and in order.
Coming down the little stairway that opened into
it was her mother, who, dazed and frightened at
the sudden apparition, gave a sort of cry and
stopped. Ph&oelig;be ran to her, gave her a kiss, and
then threw herself down upon the lowest step of
the stairs, and hiding her face in the shawl
wrapped round the baby began to sob. The
mother, in terror, began to cry too, and moan and
wring her hands and ask what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" cried Ph&oelig;be, getting up and
trying to master herself; "only I've come home
to you, mother. Oh, you must be good to me!"</p>

<p>"But <i>what's</i> the matter? Why did you come?
Where's Barry? Oh, my goodness, I always knew
it wouldn't come to any good! Oh, my poor
child, why <i>wouldn't</i> you listen to me? This is
more than I can stand. You mustn't take on so
unless you want to break my heart."</p>

<p>At this moment the driver, rather tired of waiting,
knocked at the door, which stood half open.

<!-- page 277 -->

Ph&oelig;be darted into the little bedroom that opened
from the kitchen at one side, to conceal her agitation
from the man. Her mother stood helpless
and bewildered while he asked if there was any
body to help him in with the trunks. Mrs. Holden
said she did not know; what trunks&mdash;where?</p>

<p>"Why, your girl's trunks; she as has just come
home. Come out and look at 'em, if you don't believe
me."</p>

<p>"I'll go and ask Ph&oelig;be," said the mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," cried Ph&oelig;be, who had thrown
herself upon the bed beside the baby in a paroxysm
of weeping, "pay the man and send him
away! Don't let him in here; don't let him see
you're feeling bad. Pay him and send him away,
and let me be alone for a little while."</p>

<p>Thus entreated the mother went away, and collected
herself enough to call the "hired man,"
Joe, to help about the trunks; but three times
she had to break in upon Ph&oelig;be's passion of
weeping, to decide where they should be put and
to make change to pay the man the fare.</p>

"I haven't got any change,&mdash;I haven't got a
cent!" said Ph&oelig;be. "Why can't he come in
another time? He passes here two or three times
a week. Oh, don't, <i>don't</i> make me talk about it
now!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Holden was so used to crying herself, a
puling stream of tears that was never quite dried

<!-- page 278 -->

up, that she could not understand what the objection
was to being asked about the spare room and
the driver's change in the midst of weeping.
Ph&oelig;be's tears and hers differed,&mdash;that was all
that could be said: an April shower and a mid-winter
tempest; a perennial meadow brook and
a suddenly swollen mountain torrent.</p>

<p>After the man had been paid, and had got into
his seat and gathered up his reins and gee-upped
to his horses, and gone his way much reflecting
upon the widow's agitation and the unhappy looks
of her returning daughter, the widow herself went
into the little bedroom and unwrapped the now
protesting baby from his shawl, and moaned over
him and plied his mother with questions about
him, and kissed him, and cried feebly.</p>

<p>"Do you feed him, Ph&oelig;be. He's hungry; the
poor darling is hungry. I am <i>sure</i> he's hungry.
Shall I give him a little milk? Or would
some farina suit him better? I could boil it in a
few minutes, if you could hold him till it's done.
There, there, don't cry, petty, don't. Perhaps I
might as well loosen his clothes; <i>something</i> hurts
him&mdash;I am sure. Dear, dear, it's so long since
I've had a baby to look after. Not since you. I
almost forget how to hold one. Ah me! I little
thought!&mdash;Ph&oelig;be, if you can quiet yourself a moment
to listen to me; the child <i>must</i> be fed, or
something done to pacify him. There's no good
in crying so, Ph&oelig;be. If I'd cried like that I

<!-- page 279 -->

should have killed myself years and years ago.
Goodness knows, I've had enough to cry about,
but I try to control myself, and that saves everybody.
Think about your baby, Ph&oelig;be, think
about me. You don't want to hurt us, and
you'll kill us if you go on like that."</p>

<p>Poor Ph&oelig;be; she would not have minded, that
moment, if she had been told that she <i>had</i> killed
her mother and her baby. It was the blackest moment
of her life; it was totally black, and nothing
could have made it blacker while it lasted.
She was paying for the long strain and the unnatural
silence of the past eight days. The discontents
and rebellions and complainings of ordinary
lives would make up quite as heavy an account as
she paid for all at once in that one awful hour of
despair. She was not generally discontented and
complaining, but of a full, sound nature and very
patient. It was not to be wondered at that her
mother was frightened, and gathered up the baby
and went out when she told her to. She hovered
about the door all the afternoon and listened, but
did not dare even to turn the knob or implore her
to drink the tea or eat the toast, relays of which
she had eased her maternal heart by preparing.
These slow-gathering, heavy-bursting storms have
this advantage, that they get themselves respected
and in a measure let alone. We stay in-doors and
keep out of the way of a tempest, but in frequent
paltry showers we arm ourselves and flit about defiantly.</p>

<!-- page 280 -->

<p>Late in the afternoon Ph&oelig;be came out of her
room, pale and spent. She took her baby in her
arms and sat down silently beside the fire. Her
mother fluttered about and made ready a fresh
supply of tea and toast, prepared the table for the
evening meal, and added whatever was possible
from her not very abundant larder. She did not
even try to "make talk;" she was awed into silence
for once. When it was all ready, she humbly
offered to take the baby and to keep him
while Ph&oelig;be took her tea. But Ph&oelig;be held him
on her arm, and came to the table with him.
When they sat down at the board for the first time
for so long, and in such painful circumstances, the
widow's ready tears overflowed. But they did
not touch the source of her daughter's grief nor
call hers forth again. She soothed the baby, who
fretted a little, and silently ate some of the food
put before her. Her mother waited on her anxiously,
getting up to bring this and that to her.
She did not remonstrate or express gratitude, but
took it all simply and did her best to eat. After
the meal was over she got up and tried to help
her mother put away the "tea things," but probably
found it beyond her strength, and sat down
silently by the fire again. The widow was busy
for an hour or two in matters about the house.
The "hired man" came in and helped her to bring
down a cradle from the garret and make it ready
for the baby.</p>

<!-- page 281 -->

<p>"You'll sleep with me to-night?" she asked of
Ph&oelig;be, hesitatingly. "It'll be cold for the baby
up-stairs in your old room. Joe'll make the fire,
though, if you want it."</p>

<p>"I don't care; it doesn't make any difference
to me."</p>

<p>After she had prepared the baby for sleep, and
put him in the cradle, and seen him close his eyes
heavily and finally for the night, she came out and
sat down by the fire again. Her mother sat there
rocking herself backward and forward. Ph&oelig;be
knew she had to tell her mother something of the
reasons for her coming home. It was very hard
to speak now, in cold blood, but there was no
question but that she had to do it. If she could
have done it at the moment when she first threw
herself into her mother's arms, it would not have
cost so much.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind having me home again,
mother," she began, while they both sat looking
into the fire.</p>

<p>"Why, no, Ph&oelig;be: it's been lonely enough
without you, gracious knows. Only"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you mean. Well, we mustn't
care what people say, and as long as I am doing
what I know is right I don't think you ought to
mind about it."</p>

<p>"But are you?&mdash;that's the thing," and the
widow's voice faltered, as if she were struggling
with a fresh supply of tears.</p>

<!-- page 282 -->

<p>"Yes, I believe I am. It's hard to talk against&mdash;Barry&mdash;and
I hope you'll let this be once for
all, and never say anything to me about it afterwards.
I've found he didn't&mdash;feel the way
he used to towards me. There was somebody that
he was attached to from the time he was a boy."</p>

<p>"Powers o' mercy, then why didn't he stay at
home and marry her, and leave us here in peace?"
cried the mother, hotly.</p>

<p>"No matter. He didn't, and there's the end
of it. But&mdash;and this is why I won't go back to
him&mdash;he has&mdash;said things I can't stand; he
must want to be rid of me, or he wouldn't have
said them. Don't let us talk any more about it,
mother. I've come back to you, and I'll try to
be a help to you, and I hope you won't mind the
baby. He's very good, if he's only well. I can
earn enough at sewing to keep him and me in
clothes&mdash;and&mdash;you won't mind giving us our
board. You're getting old, and you'll be glad of
a little less work. I've thought it all over, and
I don't see that there's anything better can be
done."</p>

<p>"But, Ph&oelig;be," cried her mother, now genuinely
broken down, "my child, I don't like to hear you
talk about it in that sort of way. Don't you know
it's an awful thing to go away and leave your husband?
Why, it's wicked. Oh, it might bring a
judgment on you. Have you thought about it,
have you prayed about it?"</p>

<!-- page 283 -->

<p>"Yes," said Ph&oelig;be, setting her teeth together,
"and it's done, and I don't want to talk about it
any more."</p>

<p>"But you <i>must</i> talk about it," moaned the
mother. "You haven't told me anything. You
just come home, and say you won't live with your
husband any more, and that there's the end of it.
<i>What</i> did he say? What does he say's the matter?
How can you expect me to know whether
you've done right till you tell me all about it?"</p>

<p>"There isn't anything more to tell," said
Ph&oelig;be, stolidly. "If you don't want me to stay,
I'll pack my trunk to-morrow and go and earn
my living somewhere else. There are plenty of
places; I shouldn't have to starve."</p>

<p>The widow was frightened, and began to dread
another tempest; she wept, and hurried to assure
her daughter that she was more than welcome to
her home, no matter how she came.</p>

<p>"But I can't help thinking, Ph&oelig;be"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, try to help speaking, if you can't help
thinking, mother," said Ph&oelig;be, getting up and
going towards the table. "Shall I take this lamp,
or is there one outside?"</p>

<p>She had never seen Ph&oelig;be like this before: it
was like having a child come back to you that did
not belong to you. She dissolved in tears, and sat
rocking herself by her lonely fire long after her
daughter had gone silently to bed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Ph&oelig;be had subdued her mother and
got herself let alone that first night, it would have
been too much to hope that she had made a permanent
conquest. Weak natures are the hardest
to conquer, and in dealing with them the stronger
ones are generally fain to confess self-conquest is
the only way to peace. Mrs. Holden had a feeble
judgment and a vehement will. That this
will vacillated, and was set now in this direction,
now in that, made it none the easier to get along
with her. The widow brooded over her child's
troubles; they were as her own, for she loved her
passionately. She could no more have restrained
herself from advising and trying to influence her
than she could have made herself a strong, sensible
woman <i>sur-le-champ</i>. After one night of weeping
and wakefulness, she would tell her, under protest,
that it was borne in upon her that she ought to go
back immediately to Barry. Perhaps before evening
she would have reached so different a conclusion
that Ph&oelig;be could not stay in the room and
hear her bitter reproaches of her son-in-law. She

<!-- page 285 -->

was wearing herself out, praying, crying, striving
to see what they ought to do in this most dreadful
situation.</p>

<p>"Why don't you stop thinking about it, mother?
It's my doing; you are not to blame. Just leave
it to me, and be as quiet as you can. People have
got to live their own lives; even their mothers
can't do it for them."</p>

<p>"But their mothers can't sit still and see them
going to destruction. You'll find that when your
baby gets a little older. Oh, Ph&oelig;be! you're positively
unnatural and cruel to me. You seem to
forget that it's only a few years ago that I was
doing all for you that you're doing for that baby,
and slaving for you day and night."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I didn't ask you to, any more
than the baby asks me to. And I hope I'll never
throw it in his face that I took care of him after
I brought him into the world, or that I'll think it
gives me any rights over him after he's a man."</p>

<p>"You'll see; it'll look different to you then."</p>

<p>"May be, but things generally look one way to
me."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be had been at home just three days, when
a messenger came to tell Mrs. Holden of the
serious illness of her sister, living on a farm about
ten miles away. The summons was urgent; the
poor woman was doubtless near her end. Mrs.
Holden was dreadfully agitated by the news. She
could scarcely make the necessary preparations for

<!-- page 286 -->

going. She thought Ph&oelig;be ought to go too and see
her aunt before she died. But Ph&oelig;be did not in
the least see it so. Her aunt was very little to
her, being old and money-getting and narrow-minded.
She was sorry for her sufferings, but
she knew she could do nothing to alleviate them;
half a dozen women were probably standing around
her bedside night and day. It would be intolerable
to her to spend hours, perhaps days, in the
turmoil of such a household, meeting all her relations
for the first time since her trouble. She simply
refused to go on the baby's account, and busied
herself in forwarding her mother's preparations.
Her mother could not accept the excuse. Malvina
would bring her three children; none of the
others had ever stayed away on account of having
babies; it would look unnatural.</p>

<p>When the wagon drove away with only her
mother in it beside the neighbor who had been
sent to fetch her, Ph&oelig;be said to herself it <i>was</i>
unnatural; but she knew she felt a relief and
breathed freer now that she was all alone. She
was not glad that her aunt was ill; it gave her a
feeling of awe that one of her own blood had
drawn so near the impenetrable boundary. But
it did not touch her affections, and in the gloom of
her own distress it did not seem a thing for desperate
grief that any one should have reached the
end of life. And for her mother, she felt that a
change, another grief, would really be a benefit.

<!-- page 287 -->

She had suffered so much in watching her mother's
helpless perplexity about her troubles that it was
a relief to think, for the time, they would fall into
the background.</p>

<p>The day was comparatively a peaceful one.
There was constant occupation for her in the
household work and in caring for the baby. She
laid out her work for the spring; she went up-stairs
into the unused best room and threw open
the windows, and planned for the house-cleaning
and for some changes which her enlarged experiences
of decent living now suggested. The day
was beautiful; a sudden spring day after a long
course of damp, raw weather. It was in the latter
half of April, but up to that time there had
been nothing to give one thoughts of spring and
longings to be out-of-doors. The flood of warmth
and sunshine seemed like the opening of heaven.
One panted for the summer, and hated the barriers
of winter.</p>

<p>After dinner Ph&oelig;be put the baby into a little
wagon which Joe had brought in from a loft in
the barn, and dragged him up and down the path
before the house. She threw the windows of the
kitchen wide open, and let the fire die out. She
had to loosen the baby's wraps; April though it
was, the heat was oppressive. The baby blinked
and crowed; he liked the sunshine, but it was
pretty strong for him. He looked a little pale;
high tragedy is not good for nursing babies.

<!-- page 288 -->

Ph&oelig;be decided for his sake to avoid the feelings
of high tragedy, no matter what facts were forced
upon her. She sat down beside him on the step
of the little unused porch. How delicious the
flood of sunshine, how sweet the still, warm air!
The grass was greening in the little plat between
the house and the gate; the earth was drying.
The crocuses were pushing up their heads in a
little patch under the parlor window. The long
spears of the daffodils were thrusting themselves
through the dead grass and fallen leaves and bare
shrubbery along the fence. One saw pink buds
swelling on the trees as the sun shone through the
naked branches. Ph&oelig;be thought almost with a
sensation of pleasure of the time when</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"All this leafless and uncolored scene<br/>

Should flush into variety again."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The tide of spring was bringing a little hope into
her heart.</p>

<p>"If I could be let alone," she thought, as she
drew a deep breath, "and have nothing but God
and the baby and out-doors, I could get along,
perhaps."</p>

<p>The sound of a wagon coming up the little
hill made her go quickly into the house. It was
only Farmer White and his man going to the
sugar-bush, with an empty barrel jolting in the
back of the wagon, but it broke in upon her
dream of peace. People would be the obstacles
to her "getting along," she had known from the

<!-- page 289 -->

first. Man's inhumanity to man, intentional or
accidental, seems to be at the bottom of more than
half our mourning.</p>

<p>The lengthening April day drew to its end.
The sun had set behind the far-off hills, but he
seemed to have warmed the earth so fully with
his all-day shining that no chill came on with the
growing dusk. The baby was asleep in his cradle.
Ph&oelig;be had eaten her solitary evening meal, and
Joe had taken his in the little outer kitchen. The
work of the day was over. Ph&oelig;be threw a cloak
on her shoulders and pulled the hood up over her
head, and went out into the still, warm twilight.
She left the door open that she might hear the
baby if he woke, and walked up and down the
path, and then wandered off into the old orchard
that adjoined the garden. Here had been the
playground of her childhood. Her head nearly
touched the tops of one or two low old trees which
she had considered it a feat to climb then. The
shade had seemed dense and mysterious to her;
the rocky side of the hill that arose abruptly behind
the orchard and the house had been the
boundary to who can say what, in her childish
fancy. And here her boy was to grow up; here
drink in his first draught of conscious life. Well,
it was healthy, it was simple; it might be an honest
and honorable home.</p>

<p>As she wandered aimlessly on, the latch of the
gate fell. She heard a step upon the board walk,

<!-- page 290 -->

and a sound as of some one knocking, low, at the
kitchen door. If it were some neighbor come to
feast his or her curiosity, he or she might go away
again. She felt the same trouble at the thought
of meeting any one; she wondered whether this
feeling would ever go away, or whether she would
grow "queer," as the country people called it,
as she grew older, and, shunning her kind, be
shunned of them and held in ridicule and aversion.
She shrunk behind a tree and watched.
The visitor did not go away. It was too dim to
see whether any one was standing in the door;
she had not left any light in the house. After
a moment came a pang of fear for the child; the
knock had been too low to be a neighbor's ordinary
visit. She started towards the house; just
as she reached the path she discerned the tall form
of a man standing in the doorway. He took a
step towards her, and husband and wife stood
confronting each other.</p>

<p>"You!" said Ph&oelig;be, huskily, her breath coming
quick. It was too dim to see his haggard, worn
face; she only heard the almost harsh tone of his
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not? I suppose you knew that I
was likely to come."</p>

<p>She did not speak, and he resumed, after a silence.
"You know best what you went away for.
This sort of thing is a disgrace to people who have
any kind of place to keep in the world."</p>

<!-- page 291 -->

<p>"When they haven't they don't mind," thought
Ph&oelig;be, or something like it.</p>

<p>Now Barry had had a hard day of it, not to say
a good many hard days. The heat, the worry, the
bad fare, the humiliation, the vulgar people he had
had to ask questions of, had set his teeth on edge.
He had at last found his wife. It was a little like
the Lost Heir: last night he would have thrown
himself at her feet, perhaps; to-night he felt more
like throwing reproaches at her head. All his
self-accusation vanished, and he felt himself injured
by everything she had done and by everything
she was doing, especially by the coldness
and self-control that she was showing.</p>

<p>"I don't know what excuse you have to make
for yourself," he said. She was silent. "But you
never can make up to me for these last few days."</p>

<p>As she did not speak, he went on, harshly:
"Do you know how the world looks upon people
who quarrel and who can't get on together? First
it laughs, and then it sneers at them, and then it
turns its back upon them. We have made ourselves
a laughing-stock, and now we shall have to
spend the rest of our lives trying to get people to
forget our folly."</p>

<p>Poor Barry! It seemed to Ph&oelig;be he was only
thinking of what the world said about them, and
not at all of any wounded love. In reality, he
scarcely knew what he was saying, he was so sore
and angry, so relieved and so ashamed of his past

<!-- page 292 -->

fears and yearnings, and so fatally wrong-headed
in his treatment of her. They stood confronting
each other in the dusk, silent, for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I have come to take you back with me, at
once," he broke the silence by saying hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I am not going back," she returned slowly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say"&mdash;he began.</p>

<p>"I mean to say that I am going to stay here,
or somewhere else, if it seems best, and earn my
own living as I can. About the child,&mdash;I suppose
you came about him,&mdash;you know the law gives
him to me till he is seven years old. I don't think
you could get any court to let you have him. You
care so much about what people think, it doesn't
seem to me it would be wise to try. I will do the
best I can for him while I have him. I can teach
him; the country is good for him. After that&mdash;may
be we shan't any of us be alive. There is
no use in looking ahead and worrying."</p>

<p>"You seem to have made your plans."</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I would have been very foolish
not to."</p>

<p>"Have you had any help about it?" he cried,
hotly.</p>

<p>"Take care," she said, in a restrained voice.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Ph&oelig;be," he said, firmly. "I
have come to take you back. I am willing to overlook
everything, to forgive you, to treat this outrageous
episode with eternal silence. I shall believe
in you if you tell me I can trust you. All

<!-- page 293 -->

the past shall be wiped, out. I don't know another
man would do it in my place. You have the
choice before you,&mdash;respectability and peace, or
disgrace and misery. Now choose, once for all."</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> chosen. There is no use in talking."</p>

<p>"Do you tell me you refuse my forbearance, my
forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;forgiveness!" and Ph&oelig;be's smothered
voice had deeper contempt in it than Barry
knew how to bear.</p>

<p>"Yes, my forgiveness. Perhaps women don't
know what it is to disgrace a man so before the
world, to belittle his name and his child's by making
them common talk."</p>

<p>"You are angry, Barry; it is best not to talk
any more. I am not angry."</p>

<p>"No, by Heavens, I don't think you are. I
think you are rather pleased than otherwise."</p>

<p>"I'm not as much troubled as you are about
the opinion of other people."</p>

<p>"I think the standard of opinion of well-bred
people is to be respected. It's dangerous setting
up for one's self."</p>

"A person's heart sets up for itself once in
a while, whether one will or no," thought Ph&oelig;be
vaguely, but she did not say it. Her silence
seemed to irritate him more than anything that
she had said.</p>

<p>"I don't make any threats," he said. "I don't
propose to tear the child away from you and rip

<!-- page 294 -->

open this scandal any further. But I give you
the chance of doing right by him and by me, and
repairing in a measure the wrong that you have
done us. If you come home, we have probably
both of us self-control enough to live peaceably
before the world, and get on as well as half the
married people do, whose dissatisfaction one does
not hear anything about. I place it definitely before
you: Go back with me to-morrow morning
by the early train, and all will be right. I shall
make no reproaches. Refuse to do it, and I sail on
Saturday for Europe, and join the family there.
I shall live abroad; my life in this country would
be unendurable to me with this social stigma on
it. You can understand what you will be responsible
for. I shall not, likely, be a saint."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not say what a more fluent woman
would probably have said,&mdash;that she declined to
save him on these terms.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, "if you are going to lead
a bad life, but I can't help it."</p>

<p>"I have told you that you can help it."</p>

<p>A silence. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why you make me say things
twice that you don't like to hear. I am not going
back. Why should we talk any more about
it?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed," he said, fiercely, as with a gesture
of throwing something from him he turned
away and strode down the path.</p>

<!-- page 295 -->

<p>"Don't you want to see the baby?" she said,
faintly.</p>

<p>He did not answer, probably he did not hear.
The little gate swung on its creaking hinges, and
shut her back into the old life alone. The darkness
swallowed up Barry's figure, and silence,
such a silence, settled down upon the low, solitary
house.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">AFTER ALL!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A year</span> and a half had passed; the second
summer of Ph&oelig;be's return to her home was over.
The short autumn days had come, one by one growing
shorter, growing chiller, warning of the dreary
winter that would be upon them soon. Dwellers
in isolated mountain homes do not look forward
with zest to the five or six months of winter. The
men make their preparations with very little enthusiasm
for shoveling snow and building fires
and housing cattle. It is even less hopeful for
the women; their housework is doubled and their
liberty curtailed. To the two lonely women in
the little house climbing against the hill, the coming
winter brought gloomy anticipations. The
widow was growing old, and the privation of fresh
air and the long housing made each winter harder.
Ph&oelig;be felt the imprisonment with this uncheerful
companion to be almost insupportable. The
summer days, spent in wandering about the silent
woods with her baby, after the short morning's
work was over, had been endurable, almost
peaceful. But the winter brought interminable

<!-- page 297 -->

hours of sewing, irruptions of inquisitive neighbors
from whose visits she could not escape, monotony
of occupation and scene, and no solitude.
The child, too, would fret at the confinement. The
first winter had been bad enough, when he was
just beginning to walk. What would this be,
now that he was active and self-willed and "into
everything," as his grandmother said. She was
very fond of him, but she took the liberty of slapping
his hands, and pulling him out of "everything"
with a promptness that his more even-spirited
mother disapproved. There were just
two rooms in the little habitation which could be
inhabited in winter with anything like comfort:
the summer's sitting-room was the winter kitchen;
the bedroom opening into it could be warmed
with the same fire.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart Ph&oelig;be had that day moved
the baby's crib down into this room, where she
and her mother and he were to sleep during the
cold weather. The low room up-stairs could not
be made warm enough for the child. She had left
her little refuge with a feeling that she had said
good-by to herself in doing it. To be chained
for six months to a fellow-prisoner seemed a fate
many degrees blacker than solitary confinement.</p>

<p>A temporary respite had come, however. One
of her many sisters had sent that morning and
taken the widow away for a few days' visit. Before
the walls of snow closed in around them it

<!-- page 298 -->

was well that these old women, with perhaps not
many winters left, should see each other once
again. She had gone with many regrets for
Ph&oelig;be's loneliness, for it was well understood
Ph&oelig;be would not darken any door in Malden if
she lived to be a hundred in it. It was twilight;
the little boy, tired with his day's play, had been
put to sleep in the old cradle that he had almost
outgrown. To have him near her as she sat by
the fire, she had dragged the cradle from its corner;
occasionally she touched it with her foot.
She had her basket of work beside her, but she
had not yet lighted the lamp upon the table. The
fire was blazing on the hearth, and sent a cheerful
glow through the room. She looked at it with
affection; she almost felt as if she could have
endured the winter with that to keep her company.
But it was only an autumn pleasure; with
the real setting in of winter would come the boarding
up of the fire-place, the putting away the bright
andirons, and the erecting of a black monster that
would bake, boil, roast, and stew them and their
"victuals," that would not "go out" all winter,
and that would probably last many years longer
than its victims. The windows of the kitchen
would be stuffed with cotton; the doors would be
"listed." Ph&oelig;be wondered what color the baby's
cheeks would be by April.</p>

<p>She sat on a low chair by the fire, leaning forward
on her elbows; looking now into the fire,

<!-- page 299 -->

now into the hooded cradle, now into vacancy.
She wore a dark stuff dress; around her neck was
tied a bright red silk handkerchief. She had
grown rather thinner in the year and a half, and
looked indefinably older. Her skin had a clear,
healthy tinge, but the expression of her eyes was
troubled, and her mouth had a firmer, more
"set" look. Her rich, heavy hair was put back
smoothly in a knot low in her neck. She had no
look of carelessness in her dress; the room was in
faultless order; whatever she did she did well and
thriftily. There was not a cent wrong in the little
account-book in her desk beside the window,
nor a pan that did not shine in the buttery outside
the door; the bread was sweet that she had
baked that day; the butter that she was laying
down for winter would bring the best price at the
"store." Her "preserves" were better than her
mother's had ever been; the linen, the clothes,
were all kept in better order. The garden flourished
under her care; the little farm was none the
worse for her oversight of it. In a certain way
she was interested in her work, and liked to feel
she was doing it well. But there came times, and
this was one of them, when she felt too weary to go
on,&mdash;when, as people say sometimes, she did not
feel as if she could put one foot before the other.</p>

<p>The fire-light made the room cheery, but her
heart was heavy; the way was long, and to what
end did it lead? The child might be taken from

<!-- page 300 -->

her; at best she could only keep him with her for
a few years. She could not deny those who had
a right in him, when they asked for him to give
him a proper education. Her mother's health
was failing; it was dreary with her, but blood is
thicker than water,&mdash;it would be drearier without
her. It was all pretty dark, whichever way
she looked. She did not often allow herself to go
over the past, but to-night she was alone, and sat
long idle, thinking of all that had happened and
that had failed to happen in the months since
Barry had swung the little gate shut after him, on
that warm April night, and gone away from her
forever. Not a line had ever come from him.
Why should he have written? She knew nothing
but what she had gathered from one or two letters
which <i>had</i> come.</p>

<p>The first, about two months after she had
parted from Barry, had been from his mother, an
earnest, loving appeal to her to give up her wrong
decision and come back to him to save him. It
was a letter which would have touched her very
much, if she could have felt that he was to be
saved from anything but his infatuation for his
cousin. In that effort she declined assisting. She
was a true woman, and unfortunately a jealous
one, and nothing could move her that looked to
condoning his infidelity of heart. The letter, she
judged, was written after Barry's first meeting
with his mother. It bore marks of agitation. She

<!-- page 301 -->

did not answer it at once. She never liked writing;
but this was so painful an effort that she put
it off as long as possible. Her mother, who always
insisted on knowing everything that befell
her fellow-prisoner, and who could not withhold
advice or abstain from trying to influence, had revived
the recollection of the one interview she had
had with Mrs. Crittenden, and rehearsed every
cruel word. (All this Ph&oelig;be had been trying to
forget.)</p>

<p>After she sent her cold and not very well expressed
letter, she waited long months for an
answer. She had looked for one earlier, she did
not know why. When it came, it was from Lucy,
and not from her mother. It was written in a
frightened, uncertain way, just as Lucy would have
talked if she had been compelled to confront this
sister-in-law, who had got so far out of reach upon
such a tempestuous sea that she could understand
neither the elements nor her. Lucy did not know,
evidently, how to address her, nor what to talk
about after she had told her that dear mamma
had received her letter just before her great illness;
that she was not yet well enough to sit up,
but when she was better she would write to her.
They were still abroad, waiting for mamma to be
strong enough for the journey home. Papa had
gone as soon as mamma was considered out of
danger. It was very necessary for him to be in
New York, and he had been very worried at being

<!-- page 302 -->

away so long. It was evident poor Lucy did
not know whether she ought to mention Barry or
not, and that she had finished her letter with the
conviction that it would be better not to do it, and
that Mrs. Crittenden was not well enough to be
consulted. But before she sealed it she had had
as strong a conviction in the other direction, and
had opened it to add a P. S., which said that
Barry was with them and was well, and as soon
as mamma was strong enough they would go to the
South of France with him, and he would bring
them home in the spring, if the doctors thought it
safe and wise.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not answer this letter at once; and
since her reply there had been nothing. It was
possible to imagine delays and miscarriages of letters,
even to think that death had come to some of
them, and that she was not considered near enough
to them to have been written to about it. Her
mother was not slow to tell her they were glad to
have got rid of her; that the first thing she would
hear would be that a divorce had been granted
Barry for desertion, and that he was married to
the woman whom he wanted. It seemed to give
Mrs. Holden a great deal of satisfaction to talk in
this way. She considered herself very forgiving
and as possessed of an excellent Christian spirit.
She often said she wished no ill to the Crittendens,
and she felt that that showed a very exalted character.
The edification of her example would have

<!-- page 303 -->

been greater to Ph&oelig;be if she had not rehearsed
so unendingly the ill that she considered they had
done to her.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be herself, deep in feeling, slow in utterance,
was not unforgiving; a great way down in
her heart there was the germ of a true faith, a
holy life. How did it get there? "The wind
bloweth where it listeth," and the rest. One
must not limit the work to good counsel, of which
Ph&oelig;be had not had very much. Nobody had held
out a hand to draw her into the ark that seemed
safety to her, but she had managed to get a pretty
firm grasp of it, notwithstanding. Has not somebody
said (if nobody has, somebody ought to, for
it is true), Let me compile the books of devotion
for a people, and who pleases may draw up their
creeds? There was a little book that Lucy, on a
birthday or something, had given with much hesitation
to her silent sister. It had red edges and
crosses on it; it would have frightened Mrs. Holden
into a fit, and Ph&oelig;be kept it, very properly,
very far back on a high shelf in her room. But
more than once every day she took it down and
locked her door and said her prayers out of it.
This "Treasury of Devotion" and her Prayer
Book were all the ecclesiastical spoils she had
brought out of Egypt with her, but they seemed
to have been all she needed for her sojourn in
the wilderness.</p>

<p>To-night in the unusual silence and solitude she

<!-- page 304 -->

sat idle long. At last with a deep sigh she got
up, and going across the room lighted the lamp
and put the shade on it, and brought her work
and sat down by the table to sew. Once she
thought she heard a step outside; she lifted her
head a moment and listened, and then bent it
down again and went on with her work, silent and
steady.</p>

<p>By and by there <i>was</i> a sound outside, and then
a knock. She started a little; not that she was
nervous, but she never liked a knock after dark.
The place was lonely; Joe was gone away to the
village. If any one should come with evil purpose
to her or to the child, what defense had she?
Her hand trembled a little as she laid down her
work and went to the door. She opened it quite
wide, for she did not mean to show she had any
fear, and raising her eyes looked directly into the
face of&mdash;Barry.</p>

<p>He held out his hand; she did not know exactly
what she did, but she put hers in it, and he stooped
down and kissed her. He did not look defiant,
but anxious, thinner, and older than he had before.
He came in, and she shut the door and went and
sat down where she had been sitting. It was possible
she felt as if she could not stand up any longer
without showing how she trembled. Barry, too,
was not unmoved, though he came in slowly and
went and stood beside the fire. When he first
tried to speak his voice was not audible; after a

<!-- page 305 -->

moment of silence he commanded it enough to
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, Ph&oelig;be, I have come back again,
though I believe I said I wasn't ever coming."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be sat with a beating heart, wondering
whether, as her mother had been repeating to her,
he had come to tell her he had got a divorce from
her; she only said, trying to speak calmly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought it likely you'd want to see the baby
after a while."</p>

<p>"Well, I did. I've wanted to see him all the
time."</p>

<p>"He's asleep now," she said, looking at the
cradle. "Shall I wake him up? He's been very
well all the time, and he's grown to be&mdash;the
nicest little fellow."</p>

<p>"He always was that, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, but he's so different now. He knows
so much. And he's so big,&mdash;a great deal bigger
than any of the children of his age around."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's heart was heavy with the dread that
her mother had been for a year and a half instilling
into it: was Barry come to claim the child and
show her that she had no right to him? "I've
taken the best care of him I could," she said.
"He's all I have, and I should die without him."</p>

<p>And abruptly she put her face down on the table
and began to sob. The sudden meeting had
been too much for her. Barry came over and
stooped down and tried to take her hand.</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>"I haven't come to take him away from you,
Ph&oelig;be," he said, in a husky voice. "I'm not a
brute, though you seem to think I am. I've come
to ask you once again to come back to me. Is
there any use in asking you?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head, though she did not lift
it, and he kept his hand upon hers.</p>

<p>"I can't get along without you, though I've
tried every way. My life is just spoiled. I'd rather
die than go on like this. And you are not any
too happy here, perhaps. Why can't we make it
up and begin again together? My mother, my
father, all of us, entreat you to come back."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's tears were drying up. She was wanted
to help along the reform of the prodigal son. She
did not feel the same confidence in the exaltedness
of her Christian character that her mother felt
in hers. She was afraid, when it came to that
thought, that she was almost pagan. She could
only hope that her salvation did not depend upon
her being willing to reconcile Barry to living
without his cousin Tartar. She lifted her head
and passed her handkerchief across her eyes, and
put it in her pocket.</p>

<p>"I can't see," she said, "how you can ask me,
after what has passed."</p>

<p>"I can't see how I can myself. You see how I
must be in earnest, when I can humble myself so
much. For, Ph&oelig;be, I don't want to say anything
that you won't like, but I can't see that you had

<!-- page 307 -->

a just excuse for carrying it so far. I can see
I was to blame in a good many ways. I can understand
you resented what I said that day; but
if you'd loved me it would not have been impossible
for you to forgive&mdash;just a fit of jealousy."</p>

<p>The color was coming and going in her face, and
she drew away her hand as he went on speaking.
He let it go, and turned to the mantelpiece again
and leaned against it.</p>

<p>"I don't want to justify myself, Ph&oelig;be," he
went on. "I'm ready to be as humble as a man
can be. I am only here to plead with you to come
back, and to forgive me whatever I've done wrong
or whatever you think I've done wrong. I know
I went away to Europe selfishly; it was not the
thing for me to go, leaving you so lonely. But
when I came back&mdash;and I'd been counting the
days&mdash;you could not forgive me. You were as
cold as ice. You threw me back so. I was trying
to find some reason for it. I have seen that I
found the wrong one. I ask your forgiveness for&mdash;being
jealous of Peyton. It is not easy for me
to say a thing like that, Ph&oelig;be."</p>

<p>"I am sure, Barry, you know&mdash; There is no
use in talking. If it had been only that!"</p>

<p>"Well, what under heavens was it, if it was
not that? I don't know another thing Ph&oelig;be. I
swear to you I never have been able even to conjecture
anything else that you could magnify into

<!-- page 308 -->

a cause for quarrel with me. That was bad
enough. What I said that morning was unjustifiable,
but I thought you might have put it down
to the right cause. I have felt bitter and resentful,
Ph&oelig;be, and have only come back because I
can't keep away,&mdash;because I love you so much I
can't be happy without you. I have felt bitter
and resentful that you could be so unrelenting for
so small an injury. For a hasty word, it isn't
quite the thing to ruin a man's home and break
up everything. If I had done anything that you
could lay your hand upon and charge me with"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Ph&oelig;be, getting up and
standing with her hand upon the table, leaning a
little towards it, and speaking slowly,&mdash;"it seems
to me a strange sort of&mdash;thing&mdash;to say this to
me, Barry, for you <i>must</i> know."</p>

<p>"Must know what? Ph&oelig;be, speak plainly.
Before Heaven, I tell you I know nothing more
than I have told you that would give you the
smallest reason to inflict on me what you have inflicted.
I know nothing that any woman mightn't
forgive after a half hour's fit of crying."</p>

<p>"See if a woman could forgive <i>this</i> after a half
hour's fit of crying," said Ph&oelig;be, with a dark flame
burning in her eyes, turning with a swift movement
to the old desk beside the window, and bending
down to unlock it. Her hand shook no longer.
A sort of still strength seemed to carry her forward,
as it had carried her the day she walked

<!-- page 309 -->

steadily out of her husband's house, leaving it in
order. She took a paper from the desk, and pulling
it out of the envelope handed it to him, with
her eyes fixed on his face. He took it eagerly,
read it perplexedly, re-read it; but there was no
sign of agitation on his face.</p>

<p>"It's Tartar's writing," he said.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be, white to the very lips, looked at him
silently. He stretched out his hand for the envelope,
which she gave him; studied it for a
moment; glanced again at the note, then at the
date, then at Ph&oelig;be; caught the tragic look on
her face, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you thought"&mdash;and
then burst into laughter that rang through the
little house. He threw himself into the chair beside
the table, and laughed and almost sobbed. If
he had been a woman you would have talked about
hysterics. He buried his face on his crossed arms,
and tried to hide the tears, perhaps, and to subdue
the laughter. Ph&oelig;be, meanwhile, with whiter
face and darker-burning eyes, drew back from
him, and did not speak. "Those miserable
theatricals!" he cried, lifting his head at last.
"Ph&oelig;be, you poor girl, you most silly child,
you don't tell me <i>this</i> was at the bottom of all
your trouble! <i>This</i>&mdash;oh, it isn't possible that
so much misery could come from anything so
paltry! Don't you see&mdash;why, how could you ever
have <i>helped</i> seeing&mdash;why, there's the date! You

<!-- page 310 -->

couldn't have thought Tartar was such an utter
fool as that&mdash;and I. Well, upon my word,
Ph&oelig;be, you'll have to be the one to ask forgiveness
now."</p>

<p>And he got up and went to her to take her in
his arms. But she held away from him, and said
with coldness, but trembling from head to foot,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't understand; I don't see what there
is so much to laugh about."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, earnestly, "I
didn't mean to laugh. I believe it is the relief
that makes me feel like laughing, as well as the
awful absurdity of such a mistake making such
trouble between people. Where did you find the
paper? Did I leave it at the house?"</p>

<p>"It was in your desk," she answered, looking
away.</p>

<p>"I used to empty my pockets every two or
three days of all the letters in them. I suppose I
stuffed this in among the rest. How well I remember
now about Tartar's writing it! It was
the morning before we were to play. As I was
going down the stairs, I recollected that I hadn't
written out the note I was to read, and that, depending
upon reading it, I hadn't committed it
to memory. I was in a great hurry, and I called
up to Honor to write it for me before night.
Honor was in one of her pets, and said she had
her hands full with learning her own part, and
that I could write mine for myself. I answered

<!-- page 311 -->

a little sharply, for I was late. Tartar called
down to me over the stairs not to mind; she'd
do it for me. And when I came home at night,
I found it on my dressing-table, waiting for me.
I remember I thought it was so good-natured of
Tartar, who is apt to have her caprices as well
as Honor. It's insupportable to think of such a
thing as that, such an accident of temper, doing
all this mischief, influencing all our lives. Talk
of a Providence!"</p>

<p>He strode up and down the room a few times,
till he had got himself a little under control, and
then came back to Ph&oelig;be, who stood as if turned
into stone.</p>

<p>"You blame me," she said, as he paused before
her.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you, exactly, but I think you
might have known me better."</p>

<p>"How could I know you?" she cried. "You
never used to talk to me. That summer you
grew all absorbed in business, and in winter all
in pleasure; and you stayed away, and I saw
from a great many things that they had wanted
you to marry Tartar&mdash;and&mdash;<i>you can't deny that
you were very fond of her</i>."</p>

<p>"Fond of her! Yes, as a cousin. But I never
wanted to marry her, nor she to marry me. I am
willing to tell you the truth, Ph&oelig;be. I thought
always that she liked me, and that I could have had
her if I'd wanted her, and it flattered my vanity

<!-- page 312 -->

to think so. I found out, that time she was at
my father's, just after we came home, that it was
all a mistake, and that she'd never cared for anybody
but&mdash;a very different man from me. The
discovery mortified me a little, but we've always
kept good friends, and latterly it's drawn us together
very much, for she's anything but happy.
You see, Ph&oelig;be, nothing <i>could</i> have been further
from the truth than your suspicions,&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"Not half so far as <i>yours</i>, if you will think
about it."</p>

<p>"There's no use in going over <i>that</i>. I've asked
your pardon, and it ought to end it. But if you'll
let me say, Peyton's conduct to us all shows that
something has changed him very much; I can't
say it was entirely unreasonable for me to doubt
him. A man who could cut himself off from all
his friends, break up such a business as he had
worked up for himself, and go away, without an
explanation, to live the life of a rough frontiersman
in a strange country, must have some flaw
somewhere in his character."</p>

<p>"Poor Peyton," said Ph&oelig;be, in a faltering
voice,&mdash;"has he done that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barry, coldly. "And you can't
much wonder at me. I've never seen him, and
he won't even answer when I write to him. It's
no harm, perhaps, telling <i>you</i>, but he's treated
Tartar abominably. The poor girl has been so
ill. I doubt whether she'll ever be quite well

<!-- page 313 -->

again. She'd always been very sharp and peppery
with him,&mdash;it's her nature, and she can't
help it; but her feeling for him is the deepest
you can fancy. She went abroad with us from
a sort of pique, I think. They'd had some little
tiff or other. But when she got there she was
so deadly homesick nothing but her pride kept her
from starting directly back again. I knew something
by that time of what was going on, and
she, trusting to some assurance I had made her
of what I thought his feelings were, sent back by
me a little gift for him, and a note that I suppose
said a good deal in a suppressed way. I don't
know how long it was before he answered her at
all. But when he did&mdash;well, it just killed her.
She'll never get over it. I've seen the letter,
and it was simply brutal. There's no use in talking,
Ph&oelig;be. A man who could treat like that a
woman who had shown she cared for him could
do anything and everything. It's shaken my
faith in human nature. I had never had a friend
that was as much to me as Peyton Edwards. I
should as soon have thought"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Barry!" cried Ph&oelig;be, hiding her face in
her hands. "I&mdash;want to tell you&mdash;something."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I want to hear it," he said,
jealous suspicions very easily awaking into life
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't make it any harder for
me," she said, laying one hand upon his arm, and

<!-- page 314 -->

with the other covering her face. "Promise&mdash;promise
me that you'll forgive me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shan't promise anything," he said coldly,
stepping back, but she kept her hold upon his arm.</p>

<p>"I know you'll be angry, Barry&mdash;and I am
more sorry than I can tell&mdash;but it all came about
without my knowing that I was going to do anything
that would have so much influence upon
other people."</p>

<p>Barry by this time was as white as she was;
he would have shaken off her hand, but that she
kept a strong grasp upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I showed Peyton that note"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What note?"</p>

<p>"The paper&mdash;the one I've just showed you."</p>

<p>"You did! I think you might have had better
business. Well?"</p>

<p>"And it was&mdash;just as bad to him as it was to
me. Barry&mdash;it is that that has done it all&mdash;I
never can be ashamed enough"&mdash;</P>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me, Peyton thought
Tartar had written <i>that</i> to <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"How could he help thinking so&mdash;any more
than I could? He never seemed to doubt; and,
Barry, if you'll think a minute you'll see it was
no wonder. Tartar and you were always intimate;
you were forever staying in the city all
that winter, and seeing her every day; she left
everything, and went away to Europe with you
all at a minute's warning. How do you suppose&mdash;people

<!-- page 315 -->

feel&mdash;that are left alone that way?
They have a good deal of time to think, and it
isn't strange if they don't always think right."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ph&oelig;be!" he cried, with a groan. "It's
a miserable business. Four people made so
wretched, a year and a half of such unhappiness,
the breaking of so many plans, the upsetting of
business interests, family comfort, the scandal,
the disgrace,&mdash;and all for what? Because that
little minx of an Honor wouldn't do as she was
asked&mdash;and because"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't trust you, I suppose!"
and Ph&oelig;be began to cry, burying her face in her
hands. "Oh, I hope&mdash;the baby&mdash;'ll never
know&mdash;anything about it"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, we won't tell him, Ph&oelig;be," said Barry,
putting his arm around her. "We've been a
pair of fools,&mdash;I mean I have been a fool; I
don't pretend to say what anybody else has been,&mdash;and
all that we can do about it is to be wiser
for the future."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you think that will be easy,"
said Ph&oelig;be, lifting up her head and wiping away
her tears. "But for me&mdash;I am afraid it won't
be&mdash;very."</p>

<p>"Why, what's to stand in the way of it?" he
said, sitting down beside her and drawing her close
to him. He seemed not to be thinking very much
of what she said now, but to be devouring her
with his eyes, and feeling most of all that he had

<!-- page 316 -->

got her in his arms again. She, however, had
something to say, and she said it with her face
against his shoulder and her hands before her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I believe that, to-morrow&mdash;I should be unhappy&mdash;if
I saw you pleased that other people&mdash;thought
that you were handsome"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, you won't be troubled that way much,"
he said, laughing and kissing her hair, for he
could not get at her face. "I don't believe
you've looked at me, Ph&oelig;be, or you'd see I
wasn't very dangerous nowadays."</p>

<p>But Ph&oelig;be would not look; it had cost her a
good deal to make her small confession, and she
preferred to have her hair kissed and to feel
Barry's arms around her to looking in his face
and seeing the ravages of time, and possibly a little
lurking smile about her jealousy.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen," he said, "what a miserable-looking
fellow I am, and you don't know, I
suppose, how near I've been to being no fellow at
all. This time two months ago they thought it
was all over with me. Feel how thin my cheeks
are," and he took her hand and laid it on his face.</p>

<p>"You have been ill?" she said, startled, lifting
her head and looking at him. "Oh, Barry!"
she cried, throwing her arms around his neck and
bursting into tears, "and you never sent for
me!"</p>

<p>"Considering that I should have been dead six

<!-- page 317 -->

times over before you could have got to me, and
that I was beyond being consulted, and that you
probably wouldn't have come if you had been sent
for, I don't think you need reproach me very
much. Such as I am I'm here, and that ought
to be enough for you."</p>

<p>"What was the matter with you? How long
were you ill, and who took care of you?"</p>

<p>"If I said Tartar, you know you wouldn't like
it."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't," said Ph&oelig;be, growing crimson,
and taking her arms away from his neck.
He made amends by getting his much firmer
round her, and by holding her so tight against him
that he could feel her every breath.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i>&mdash;a jealous woman."</p>

<p>"You knew that before," she said, trying to
get away from him.</p>

<p>"No, by heavens, I didn't. I thought you were
too quiet to get jealous."</p>

<p>"Being quiet doesn't help things," she said.</p>

<p>"No, it seems not. Well, about Tartar taking
care of me. If she hadn't I probably shouldn't
have been here. For we've had the most infernal
time of it. My mother and Honor last spring
came down with a fever, that they'd picked up in
Naples probably, just as we were getting ready to
come home. Tartar was barely up after her own
illness of the winter, but my mother was so ill she
and Lucy had to forget themselves in looking

<!-- page 318 -->

after her and Honor. They both pulled through;
but we were all pretty well used up, and before
the invalids were fit to start for home I was taken
with I suppose very much the same sort of a fever.
It had been longer in developing, and it played
the very deuce with me when it did develop.
Lucy had by this time got so run down herself
she was of hardly any use at all; and if it hadn't
been for Tartar, as I said, Heaven knows what
would have become of me. Come, Ph&oelig;be, I hope
you'll forgive her. Aren't you willing to accept
me as a gift from her? It wasn't any trifle,
those two months of nursing, two thirds ill herself,
poor girl."&mdash;</p>

<p>"People in Europe generally send for a Sister
of Mercy, when they're ill in a story-book."</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't ill in a story-book, but in a
cursed little Italian town, where you couldn't
have got a Sister of Mercy to save your soul (or
nurse your body). Now, Ph&oelig;be, do the handsome
thing. Tell me you forgive Tartar for having
known your husband before you did, and that
you thank her for saving his life, and that you're
prepared to love her like a sister."</p>

<p>He kissed her and kissed her, and did not seem
to care what he said himself or what she answered
him as long as he held her in his arms. But
Ph&oelig;be, more earnest, could not consent to dry her
tears. "You seem to think it's all over. But
I've been too unhappy to believe that."</p>

<!-- page 319 -->

<p>"You haven't been any more unhappy than I
have," he said, a little more seriously. "But I'm
inclined to think we won't be any the worse for
it. We began life wrong, Ph&oelig;be, God forgive
us! Haven't we wiped out the score a little, all
these two or three years of misery? Come, there's
no use talking about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is use," said Ph&oelig;be, with tears.
"Oh, Barry, it's so hard&mdash;to look at just&mdash;sins."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't the pleasantest kind of contemplation,
I know," said Barry, with a sigh. "The
fact is, Ph&oelig;be, I don't like to look back. I think
I was about as well equipped to go to the devil as
any young fellow I know. If I'd turned wrong at
a certain point in my life, Heaven knows where I
should have brought up. I'm not much to brag
of now. But, zounds, if I had had my swing!"</p>

<p>He released Ph&oelig;be, and walked two or three
times across the room. "It makes one shudder,"
he said, "to look down the precipices one just
hasn't slipped over. I don't see, though, how my
mother's son could have got so deuced near the
edge."</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be, remember this," he said, stopping before
her: "whatever remnant of happiness we
have now we owe it to my mother. In our first
desperation and misery I doubt if I should ever
have had courage to do right but for the help that
I know she made my father hold out to me. He

<!-- page 320 -->

alone would have cowed me. I was afraid of the
world, and he was on the world's side. I knew by
instinct what side she was on, though she was too
pure-minded ever to have named to me the sin
that I had fallen into. The thought of her always
helped me. You must love her, Ph&oelig;be.
She's better worth it than I am, and I know you
love me." Then more lightly, "But I want to tell
you one thing more: I believe I am discharged
cured in the matter of caring what people think."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm glad of that," said Ph&oelig;be, simply.</p>

<p>"It's lucky," he went on, "for we'll probably
never have money enough to make people respectful
to us on that account, and I don't think we've
behaved ourselves so as to make them respectful
to us on any other. We'll just live for ourselves
and the boy, and all that."</p>

<p>"All that" was probably meant to cover duty,
the service of God, loftiness of aim, and unworldliness;
at least, so Ph&oelig;be understood it, and was
satisfied.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p class="small">IN MY LADY'S CHAMBER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was near midnight: the bell was ringing in
the belfry of the not very distant church. Mrs.
Crittenden, lying on the sofa in her little dressing-room,
heard the door close and the sound of voices
die away below the window as the last ones of the
family went out to the midnight celebration. First
Ph&oelig;be and Barry went, then Honor and her young
English lover, then Tartar and Peyton Edwards,
and lastly Lucy and her father.</p>

<p>They were all again at Marrowfat, and the
blinds, dingy with the dust of two years, were
again open, and lights shone from the windows.
There had been a good deal for Lucy to do, but it
was well for Lucy to be busy, particularly as no
amount of business ever damaged her serene temper.
There had been the house to open, new servants
to get, the whole machinery to put in motion
again. The Christmas party now assembled was
not inconsiderable for a house just on its feet, and
for such a young housekeeper. Barry and Ph&oelig;be,
the boy and his nurse, Aunt David, Tartar and
Peyton Edwards, had come from the city by the

<!-- page 322 -->

six o'clock train; the young Englishman had arrived
earlier, and was in a sense a permanent
guest. Honor was looking very pretty; her hair
had been cut short after her Italian fever, and was
coming out in delightful little curls. Her eyes had
a soft and shy expression, and she went about in
a dream of bliss. Naturally she was not very useful
to Lucy in the management of the house and
the entertaining of the visitors; except, of course,
the visitor with the blonde mustache and the
many-jointed name.</p>

<p>It was a still night, very light, but with no moon
or stars that one could see; there was a deep but
well-trodden snow on the ground; the air was not
sharp, though not mild or damp. You could hear
sounds very far off; Mrs. Crittenden almost
thought she heard the music swell after the bell
stopped ringing.</p>

<p>She had had much experience in imagining how
scenes and people looked that she was not permitted
to see, and she was likely to have much
more as the years went on, for it did not seem probable
that she would ever again go far beyond the
limits of her own room. She was told that there
was great reason for surprise that she was still in
the land of the living, and that she need never
look again to be in the ranks of the working and
enjoying. She had accepted the decree, and had
settled herself into the life that lay before her with
silent fortitude.</p>

<!-- page 323 -->

<p>She knew when her active life got its death-blow:
that night when she watched the stars out
in this same room. The very springs of her being
seemed to have been broken by that blow. She
had never been a well or strong woman since; she
had just been going down, down, one illness after
another, till she had come to the not uncommon
lot of a "confirmed invalid." Too common; like
the Egyptian plague, there seems scarcely a house
where there is not one dead,&mdash;dead to pleasure,
to active duty, to natural, buoyant feelings. In
our rushing, tumultuous modern life, perhaps it is
necessary for some souls to be stretched on the
rack for the world that will not pause to pray
for itself; that the apostleship of suffering be laid
on some elect ones. But it is sometimes impossible
not to faint at their tribulations for us; it
requires faith to see that by their bonds we are to
be partakers of their grace; it is hard to accept
for our dear martyrs what they have accepted for
themselves. All that we now see of suffering we
see through a glass darkly; when the last word
is spoken of that gospel, we shall change our estimates
of its value, very likely. "There is only
one power against sin, and that is, suffering.
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> has taught us that love alone is not
sufficient."</p>

<p>To the eyes of those around her Mrs. Crittenden
was a serene, even a cheerful sufferer; when there
were no eyes upon her, as to-night, the cheerfulness

<!-- page 324 -->

went, though rarely the serenity. She could never
cease to love, almost to long for, God's gifts of
health and bright social life, and the power to enjoy
nature, what Ph&oelig;be, in her contracted vocabulary,
would have called "out-doors." She had an
eager mind and keen senses; she was not the sort
of woman who easily sinks into helplessness; she
was the last person to take kindly to a sofa and
bromide of potassium. Her steps downward she
had taken with a clear mind and a strong abhorrence
of her fate. "If it be possible"&mdash;</p>

<p>But it was not possible; and when she reached
the last step and was at the bottom and was shut
into her dim cell, where not a ray of earthly
hope could penetrate, there was a desperate revolt,
an hour of darkness; and then one of those
miracles of grace began which are the despair of
materialists and the edification of supernaturalists.
Intense pain, alternated with languor inexpressible,
and deprivation of all life's healthy
pleasures do not seem to the candid carnal mind
the elements out of which to form a strong faith,
a cheerful temper, and "a good understanding."
That this unlikely result was in evidence daily and
hourly in the Crittenden family no one could
deny.</p>

<p>Her life was lonely and high. The ill are always
lonely: it is "a strange land" upon which
they have entered; no one goes with them, and
they have to learn its speech and laws for themselves.

<!-- page 325 -->

Lucy stood closest, and went farthest with
her. But even she could not go far. She, with
healthy senses, could see the moonlight and the
sunlight, and smell the evening breeze as it blew
across from the hills. She could read with zest,
eat with enjoyment, sleep with profound forgetfulness,
move with the freedom of youth and
health. And yet her heart was full of love for
her mother; her life was consecrated to the care of
her. She had infinite tact and a good deal of imagination.
But with all that, she could only stand
upon the borders of the land where her mother
lived, alone. In days of health</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Not even the tenderest heart and next our own<br/>

Knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How much more exiled from human sympathy
must they be who always live in pain, "their lives'
sad undersong," who do not know a moment of
healthy vigor or an hour of unbroken sleep, upon
whom the thousand unhappy sensations of a diseased
body are continually pressing! That spirit
can rise above matter and through long years
keep its ascendency at such a disadvantage gives
one a respect for that which is not material.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crittenden lay listening to the music that
she seemed to hear, and picturing to herself what
the scene was in the church: the warmth, the glow,
the smell of the evergreens, the shining of the
laurel leaves, the soft depths of the fir branches,
the rich colors of the altar and its many lights.

<!-- page 326 -->

She put out her hand upon the crib in which the
sleeping boy lay who had been left in her care,
while his mother should be away at church. She
whispered, leaning over him,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Soon will a thousand bells ring out,<br/>

A thousand roofs the choral shout<br/>

Prolong, where Kings with Shepherds meet,<br/>

His manger with their gifts to greet.<br/>

What shall we do, mine infant dear,<br/>

Who may not those glad anthems hear?<br/>

How shall we serve Him, thou and I,<br/>

Far from that glorious company?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Poor little boy! he had had an illness, and the
hand that lay in hers was thin and frail. She
wondered wistfully if his life would be better or
worse than that of his father, of whose future she
had spent so many years in dreaming here in this
very room, here on this very pillow. Ah, Barry,
Barry! you have wrung our hearts; you have
killed our hopes; you have failed to make a name
and place for yourself among your fellows. Who
could be less of a success than you?</p>

<p>And yet there was deep peace in her heart that
night. Barry's son might have a worse fate than
to be like his father. The courage of her convictions
had come back to her. Yes, she had
done right. If she had helped him to lose the
world, she may be had helped him to save his
soul. And to people bound to beds of pain the
saving of one's soul looks so much larger than
even a great measure of temporal success. Yes,

<!-- page 327 -->

she was glad that Barry had undone himself in the
eyes of the world. Without the sin, she would ask
nothing better for this pretty baby, whose small
hand she held, than what his father was starting
with now,&mdash;a true love and a low fortune, the
fear of God and small countenance from men.</p>

<p>At last voices sounded again below the window,
and steps crossed the piazza, and the hall door
opened. They were coming back, one after another;
it was nearly two o'clock. Their voices
were subdued and quiet, as became those who
were coming back from such a service. One after
another they came softly to the door of the dressing-room.
First, it was Ph&oelig;be, who entered with
a wistful look towards the little crib.</p>

<p>"He hasn't wakened?" she said, in a whisper,
leaning down towards her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, with a smile. "There
hasn't been anything to do, though I promised
you I would take care of him for you."</p>

"You said that once before to me," said Ph&oelig;be,
with sudden emotion in her voice and face. "I
wish&mdash;I had"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Mrs. Crittenden.
"When did I say it?"</p>

<p>"That day&mdash;when Barry went away with
you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember," whispered the mother, drawing
her down to her, and putting her arm about
her neck. "Dear child, we did a cruel thing.

<!-- page 328 -->

I always reproached myself that you were left.
I knew it was wrong. But you have forgiven
us."</p>

<p>"Forgiven you&mdash;oh!"&mdash;said Ph&oelig;be, with a
sort of shudder.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? You can't? Or that
you think it is the other way? Oh, let me tell
you this to-night: I thank God for you; you are
one of the blessings of my life. I couldn't ask
anything better for Barry. Love me and trust
me, Ph&oelig;be, and forgive me for anything painful
in the past in which I have ever had any
part."</p>

<p>If Ph&oelig;be's life had hung upon it she could not
have said what she felt. It was fortunate that her
mother-in-law understood her and interpreted correctly
her kiss and clasp of the hand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" said Barry, coming in. "My
mother still awake? A merry Christmas to you,
mother, and a robuster grandson to keep you
company next year."</p>

<p>He stooped down and kissed her. The little
movement around him made the child wake up;
he put out his arms to his father, who took him
up and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell us all merry Christmas."</p>

<p>He laid his sleepy head down on his father's
shoulder, with his eyes wide open, and did not
show the least intention to speak.</p>

<p>"It's pleasant for a parent to be obeyed," observed

<!-- page 329 -->

Barry, "but it's a pleasure I don't often
taste."</p>

<p>"Here are some flowers for you, mamma," said
Honor, at the door. "May Reginald bring them
to you?"</p>

<p>"It seems to be in order to say good-night
here," said Tartar, following.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it isn't in order to say anything else,"
cried Lucy. "Mamma won't have a moment's
sleep if you all don't go away."</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't hurt me to give Tartar a kiss.
And isn't Peyton in the hall?"</p>

<p>Peyton answered for himself, and gaunt and
tall stooped down to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>"This is quite worth staying awake all night
for," she said, still holding his hand, and looking
up with shining eyes upon the group that stood
around her sofa. "Last year half of us on one
side of the ocean and half on the other."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Barry, with a laugh. "I think
we'll all agree this Christmas is worth two of last.
Come, Tartar, tell us if it isn't!"</p>

<p>"Answer for yourself," said Tartar, turning
away, her dark skin suddenly darkened by a blush.
"What was the matter with last Christmas? I
for one enjoyed it thoroughly. It had been the
dream of my life to be at Rome on Christmas."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only it didn't seem to me you
were in the very highest spirits, if I remember
right."</p>

<!-- page 330 -->

<p>"Well, you don't remember right, since you
had the fever. You rarely do. Lucy, didn't you
tell us we ought to say good-night?"</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed Mrs. Crittenden lightly,
and went out into the hall, picking up her bonnet
and muff, and hurrying to the stairs that led
up to her room. But Peyton was as quick, and as
she put her hand upon the newel-post he put his
over it.</p>

<p>"You must take that back," he said.</p>

<p>"Take what back?" she asked, looking up at
him defiantly."</p>

<p>"<i>Wasn't</i> there anything the matter with last
Christmas? Come, you've got to tell me that
there was."</p>

<p>"There wasn't anything the matter with it;
the sun shone in a perfect glory."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't talking about the day. I was
talking about you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you didn't express yourself with
accuracy."</p>

<p>"I'll be accurate now. You said that you enjoyed
it thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Why not? I remember I had a little headache
towards the afternoon, but the morning had
been heavenly."</p>

<p>"Had you been crying, that you'd got a headache,
Tartar?"</p>

<p>"Crying? What had I to cry about? Peyton,

<!-- page 331 -->

you'll please remember I haven't given you
the right to say such things as that to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have. You can't take <i>that</i> back,
you know."</p>

<p>"We'll see!" she cried, tearing off a ring with
a great diamond in it, and dropping it upon the
floor of the hall. While Peyton stooped to pick
it up, he had to take his hand off hers. She
profited by the release to fly swiftly up the stairs.</p>

<p>But he followed her in three bounds, and caught
her at the landing-place, where there was no light
except from the hall below.</p>

<p>"You'll make me hate you," she cried, panting.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," he said, holding her hands.
"You did it to make me kiss you, and I don't
mean to disappoint you, ever."</p>

<p>Her slender hands had not as much power of
resistance as her tigerish heart. He got the ring
on again, and he got his kiss, but he didn't get
her to recant about last Christmas.</p>

<p>"It was a perfect day, and I enjoyed it thoroughly;
more, a great deal more, than I shall this.
Of that I'm very certain."</p>

<p>The others were coming up by this time, and he
had to let her go. His eyes followed her. Why
should she say such things? That, perhaps, will
always be a problem to him, but nothing will ever
disaffect him.</p>

<p>Tartar will go on saying what she does not

<!-- page 332 -->

mean, and Ph&oelig;be failing to say what she does, to
the end of their mortal pilgrimage; and Peyton
and Barry will go on loving them and cherishing
them, admiring them if not understanding them,
thanks to that law of love, affinity, election, sympathy,
whatever it is that brings Jack to Gill and
keeps him constant to her.</p>
