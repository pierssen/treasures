<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE JOURNEY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> narrative which, we are about to
lay before our readers commences in
1708, in one of the wildest portions of
the county of Foix, which county, in the
partition made during the revolution, comprises
the district of Lavelanet. If our
readers will accompany the three travellers
who pursued a difficult path along
the borders of a torrent, they will at the
same time become acquainted with several
of the actors in this story and with
the scene of its principal events.</p>

<p>One of the three travellers was mounted
upon a goodly and well caparisoned
mule; the two others rode upon wretched
nags which had no other recommendation
than that of being able to advance
with a step almost as sure as that of the
mule, along a road marked out by the
feet of men or animals alone.</p>

<p>The individual who bestrode the mule,
and to whom we shall first direct the
reader's attention, as he was of a rank
superior to that of his companions, seemed
to be about forty or forty-five years
of age. He wore <i>braies</i> or wide breeches,
tied above the knee, and stout, funnel-shaped
boots. His doublet of black velvet

<!-- page 3 col 2 -->

had large flaps which covered his
thighs; it was buttoned to his chin, showing
glimpses of a white cravat <i>a rabat</i>,
as worn in the cities, by the gentlemen
of the robe, whether magistrates or advocates.
His features bore the stamp of
spirit, firmness and intelligence, although
they could not exactly be called remarkable;
his habits of thought were denoted
more accurately by his glance, perhaps,
than by any other characteristic; at
times, it roamed with a sort of restless
curiosity over every thing that met his
eye, at times, it fastened itself suddenly
upon some single object, as if unable to
tear itself away. It is thus with the
pointer when in quest of game; he darts
onward, coming and returning, snuffing
on all sides, following every trace, leaving
and resuming them, ever agitated and
restless, until the moment when he stops
motionless before the prey which he has
at last discovered.</p>

<p>Judging from this similitude, it might
be said that the man of whom we speak,
was at this moment in quest of something,
for he passed neither bush, nor
mound, nor tree, without scanning it with
the utmost care. This man was the
Sieur Barati, councillor of the parliament
of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The one who followed him (for the

<!-- page 4 col 1 -->

road being far too narrow to allow two to
ride abreast, the three advanced one after
the other), was dressed entirely in
black. He wore a wretched pair of
spurs fastened to his high-heeled shoes, a
precaution doubly useless; in the first
place, because his steed was completely
insensible to this kind of admonition; in
the second, because the legs of the individual
in question were so short, that he
could only prick the sides of his saddle.</p>

<p>If to this sketch of the rider, we add,
that from the fear of falling, he had
spread himself, as it were into two parts,
holding with one hand the mane of his
pony, and with the other, the pummel of
his saddle, the reader will have a tolerably
correct idea of master Langlois,
clerk of the chamber of inquest and of
the parliament of Toulouse. If we hesitate
to compare him to an ape on horseback,
it is because the first glance at his
face would at once banish such an idea,
if by chance it had entered the mind of
a spectator. A narrow visage, a hooked
nose of enormous size, thin and contracted
lips, gave him rather the aspect of a
bird of prey. His eyes, like those of the
Sieur Barati, were perpetually in motion,
but it was by no means the same
motive which gave them this activity,
for profound terror was stamped upon
every feature of this man's face, and
this terror was so intense, that his habitual
paleness had assumed a hue almost
livid and cadaverous.</p>

<p>The one who rode foremost evidently
belonged to an entirely different class
from that of his companions. He was a
sturdy peasant of twenty-five years,
clothed in a coarse garb of grey woollen
stuff, and wearing a felt hat, from beneath
the wide brim of which, escaped
a profusion of black hair. He was of the
middle height, and seemed of a strong
and muscular frame. His face wore the
characteristics of the Arab, and his brown
coppery hue seemed to designate him as
belonging to this race, or as a descendant
from it. He advanced whistling, casting
around an indolent glance, as if there
were nothing new to discover in a country
which he had traversed a hundred
times before. Still, however, he did not
seem entirely free from apprehension,
for a pair of long pistols could be seen

<!-- page 4 col 2 -->

at his saddle bow, and beneath his left
arm he carried a musket which he was
unwilling doubtless to sling across his
shoulder, that it might the sooner be in
readiness, if an occasion offered which
required its services.</p>

<p>For the rest, it was easy to see that
he was capable of using it with courage
and dexterity. Whether it were that
some profound thought entirely absorbed
him, or that he acted voluntarily and
with intention, the kind of careless chirrup
which he whistled, became by degrees
more emphatic, and in a short time
the shrill sounds were sufficiently distinct
to be heard at a great distance.</p>

<p>At this moment the travellers were advancing
toward two hills, which seemed
to unite in an acute angle; this doubtless
had formerly been the case, but the
constant action of the waters had gradually
separated them, leaving a free passage
to the torrent, which bordered the
path along which our travellers were advancing.
The narrowness of this passage
in which the torrent and the road
shrunk, as it were, into closer boundaries,
the one, running with a deep and
headlong current, the other, contracting
to a line of three feet in width, at most,
together with the conformation of the
mountains, had gained for this spot the
name of the Tunnel. In truth, the dense
forests of firs which covered the two
heights, and hung over the passage, gave
it, when viewed at a moderate distance,
the appearance of an immense tunnel
lying along the road.</p>

<p>The whistling of the foremost traveller
seemed now to alarm one of those
who followed him.</p>

<p>"Holla, master Galidou!" cried the
clerk, "it seems that the nearer we approach
danger, the less your precaution.
Do you wish to warn all the cut throats
of the neighborhood that they may find
here two honest men to butcher?"</p>

<p>"I am glad to see that you do not
count yourself among the number, old
ink-vender," said Galidou. "I will inform
the cut throats of it if they come,
and they will spare you as being one of
the trade."</p>

<p>"Worthy councillor," said Langlois,
"will you suffer this boor of a mountaineer
to insult an officer of parliament

<!-- page 5 col 1 -->

on account of a remark, which, as you
yourself must acknowledge, is perfectly
just."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge, in the first place, that
your remark, though just enough in its
commencement, ended in a manner that
I think very insolent, unless you attach to
the number two, the same sense which
master Galidou has attributed to it; consequently
I must insist on your being silent,
and I would know from our guide
why he whistles so loudly."</p>

<p>"By my troth, worthy councillor," replied
the latter, taking his bridle between
his teeth, and raising his musket to a
level with his shoulder, as if about to
discharge it, "it is to see if it will not
lure out a few <i>roquets</i>,* and it would not
be bad to prevent two or three of them from
returning to their kennel up yonder."</p>

<p class="small">[*Shock dogs.]</p>

<p>At these words the councillor suddenly
reined in his mule. Langlois' horse,
which followed with drooping head, came
in contact with the beast, and started
back so quickly, that the clerk uttered a
cry of terror, as if he were about to be
precipitated into the foaming torrent.</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!" said the councillor in
a stern tone. "That cry of itself is
enough to arouse those who are interested
in preventing our arrival."</p>

<p>"No, worthy councillor," said Galidou,
pausing like the rest, "the <i>roquets</i>
will never think that a human being
could utter such a cry. For my part,
I never heard but one that resembled it,
and that one was a cry of distress from
an old fox, which a she bear was quietly
disembowelling, for coming to play with
her cubs. It was on this very spot."</p>

<p>At these last words the clerk began to
tremble in the saddle, and drew up his
legs still higher than before.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu! mon dieu!</i>" he exclaimed,
"is it lawful to send honest people to
travel in such a country? Worthy
councillor, since you find my observation
just, permit me to make a second.
What if we were to give up this journey?"</p>

<p>"How, sir?" said the councillor,
sternly, "the parliament has directed me
to make a perquisition in this district, and
I will perform my duty, whatever danger
I may incur, whether from men or
from wild beasts."</p>

<!-- page 5 col 2 -->

<p>The mountaineer gazed at the councillor,
as if to assure himself that this
courage existed in his heart, as well as
in his words, Barati perceived it, and,
as if offended by the scrutiny, added in
a peremptory tone.</p>

<p>"That then is the baron's castle?"</p>

<p>This was the building toward which
Galidou had pointed, in speaking of the
kennel, to which he wished to prevent
the <i>roquets</i> from returning, and it was
the sight of this castle that had induced
the councillor to check the progress of
his mule.</p>

<p>Through the immense forest of fir-trees
with which it was surrounded, they
had caught an occasional glimpse of its
highest turrets, without being able to
judge, either of the strength or the extent
of this feudal mansion, but at this
spot, a vast opening disclosed it to its
very base, and although they were unable
to see the deep moat which surrounded
it on all sides, the height of its
walls rendered it evident that it was a
fortress difficult to be taken by regular
troops, and entirely impregnable to the
bands of marauders who ravaged this
portion of the country.</p>

<p>The councillor remained with his eyes
fixed upon the castle, as if he would fain
pierce its walls, and examine its interior,
while Galidou, unable to conceal his
emotion beneath an affected air of indifference,
replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, worthy councillor, yonder is the
porch where the Baron de la Roque roosts
when he has done a deed of mischief,
and it is there that he gives an asylum
to all the robbers of the country, who
engage to lend him aid when he claims
their services."</p>

<p>"It was to these, I suppose, that you
referred a moment since, when you called
them <i>roquets?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Galidou, giving
way to sudden fury, "I call them <i>roquets</i>,
and it is better than they deserve;
it is an insult to a dog to call these fellows
by that name. True <i>roquets</i> will
turn and snap, but these brigands here,
they know well enough how to aim a
musket from behind a wall, but as soon
as they find themselves face to face with
a man, they run like a hare from a hound.

<!-- page 6 col 1 -->

I should like to meet three or four of
them here to send them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The mountaineer did not complete
his sentence in words, but two or three
expressive gestures satisfied the councillor
that Galidou would have felt no scruple
in hurling them by one means or another
into the depths of the torrent.</p>

<p>"It is the employment of force that
leads to the abuse of force," replied the
councillor, with that severe and imperative
tone which seemed habitual to him,
"it is not in this way that you will make
good your cause before the parliament."</p>

<p>"To the devil with the parliament!"
said Galidou, resuming his journey, "it
is not my cause that it will judge, it was
not I who desired to invoke its justice,
but my father has wished it so, and I
have obeyed him; but for that, you
would now be sleeping quietly in your
bed, I swear to you. Fortunately, after
the business has been dragging on for a
year, the parliament seems at last to be
stirring in the matter. Well, so much
the better, for my father will now see
that the parliament will do no more than
the judges of the bailiwick de Foix have
done, and will let me act in my own
way, and when the hour comes, may
God confound me, if I leave one stone
upon another of this accursed castle. I
will level it as flat as the palm of my
hand."</p>

<p>Galidou was interrupted by the hoarse
laugh of Langlois, who cried, "<i>Peste!</i>
what a taker of citadels, my friend! and
how, and with what will you do all that!"</p>

<p>"If you were to inquire with what I
can break your bones, master clerk,"
said Galidou, "I would show you at
once, but you ask a question which I
would not answer, were it the king himself
who addressed it to me."</p>

<p>"There is no need of so high an authority
to make you answer, master Galidou,"
said the councillor. "Suppose it
were my pleasure to put such a question
to you?"</p>

<p>"I would let you have the pleasure of
repeating it as often as you saw fit," replied
Galidou in a careless tone.</p>

<p>"Take heed to your words&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And do you take heed to your voice;
we are approaching a spot where every
sound spreads from echo to echo to the

<!-- page 6 col 2 -->

very depths of the Tunnel. Do not utter,
then, that which you are unwilling
should be heard."</p>

<p>"The most prudent plan, I think,"
said Langlois, "would be to say nothing
at all."</p>

<p>"The most prudent above all," said
Galidou, "would be not to speak in a
cracked and trembling voice like yours.
Do you not know, master Goosequill, that
the fears of one party make up three-quarters
of the courage of the other?
Come! firmly upon the stirrups, we have
but five minutes more of dangerous road;
let us try to pass it without hindrance."</p>

<p>He fastened the bridle of his horse
about his neck, and said to the councillor,
"Do not interfere with the movements
of your beast, his instinct will guide
him better than you can do. As to you,
master Goosequill, shut your eyes to
keep your brain from growing giddy. If
your nag stumbles, why at any rate, he
will fall into the torrent with you; if not,
you might fall all alone."</p>

<p>Having said this, he cocked his musket,
and spurred his horse into a trot.
Galidou held himself almost erect upon
his stirrups, with his weapon ready, and
glancing upon every side for the appearance
of an enemy in the hollow way
which they were about to traverse. The
councillor followed him, not without
alarm, but with a voluntary exertion of
courage which gave him an air of imperturbability.
In the new position in
which he found himself, the danger to
which he was exposed wore an aspect to
which the magistrate was unaccustomed.
In this narrow path, where the slightest
mis-step on the part of his mule, might
precipitate him into the foaming torrent,
the possibility of an assault, and a conflict,
hand to hand, with brigands, the
gloom of the passage, these mountains
inhabited by wolves and bears, all combined
to operate upon the physical weakness
of a man who seldom went beyond
the walls of the city in which he lived,
and although the moral courage of
the magistrate impelled him resolutely
forward, yet it may be said that the
man trembled.</p>

<p>As to Langlois, although he had not
followed Galidou's counsel, although he
had not closed his eyes, but held them

<!-- page 7 col 1 -->

open in such a manner that they seemed
ready to start every moment from his
head, yet it is certain that he saw neither
where he went, nor what was passing
around him, and the moderate trot of his
pony, seemed like a whirlwind bearing
him on in its fury. If he had not clung
fast with both hands, and even with his
spurs, which at last became entangled in
the sides of his saddle, he would probably
have lost his seat at the first step,
and notwithstanding the convulsive grasp
of his limbs, he would have fallen, as it
was, before proceeding many paces, if
Galidou's horse had not stopped on a
sudden. The mule paused also, and the
pony after him, and the sudden contact
of these three animals, impelled the councillor
abreast of Galidou, his mule being
forced against the acclivity of the mountain,
while the peasant was crowded to
the very verge of the torrent.</p>

<p>A step or two behind them, Langlois'
nag had fallen to the earth, and the unfortunate
clerk lay prostrate upon the
neck of his beast, but as his spurs held
fast to the saddle, he was unable extricate
himself from this position, except
by resuming his seat. His attempts to
do this, however, were frustrated by the
struggles of the pony, as it endeavored
to regain its feet, and which, unable to
rise, from the weight which pressed entirely
upon its neck, seemed at least resolved
to shake it, and that with a violence
which threatened the clerk with
an instantaneous plunge into the abyss.
In consequence of this, Langlois commenced
to scream with such force and
perseverance that it was impossible for
Barati and Galidou to exchange a word.
At last, by a desperate effort, Langlois
extricated, not his spurs from the saddle,
but his feet from his shoes, and cast himself
precipitately against the slope of the
mountain, where he continued to cry as
before.</p>

<p>"Will you be silent?" said Galidou,
roughly. "Must I break your head to
keep you quiet?"</p>

<p>Langlois rolled a few paces farther off,
and entrenched himself behind his pony,
which at last had risen from the ground.
In the meanwhile, the councillor, more
pale than he would have wished, doubtless,
and, in a voice, which, despite all

<!-- page 7 col 2 -->

his efforts, betrayed his emotion, turned
to Galidou, and said:</p>

<p>"What is the matter there? why do
you stop?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter? <i>pardieu!</i>" cried
the latter, "why it lies under your
very nose. I stopped, because I could go
no farther."</p>

<p>In truth, a pine tree which once grew
upon the side of the mountain, about a
fathom above the road, had fallen directly
across their path, completely barring all
passage, and at a spot where the way
turned suddenly aside.</p>

<p>"It is an accident, doubtless," said
Barati, who, thanks to the moral courage
with which he was endowed, had by
this time regained his equanimity, "the
tree must have been uprooted by the hurricane."</p>

<p>Galidou pointed with the muzzle of
his musket toward the foot of the pine
tree, while his flashing eyes roamed
over every object around, and then with
the indignation of a man who is without
fear, but who is enraged at finding
himself at the mercy of a hidden enemy,
he replied:</p>

<p>"The wind does not make cuts like
those. The axe has been here, and I am
greatly deceived, or I know the arm,
which, with three blows could fell a tree
like that, for the axe has struck it but
thrice."</p>

<p>"Neither more nor less," replied a
voice from a group of trees on the other
side of the torrent. "You are not deceived,
Galidou, three strokes of the axe,
and the tree was down."</p>

<p>Near as he was to Galidou, the councillor
did not remark the slight agitation
which the sound of this voice called up
in the features of the young mountaineer;
not a muscle of that robust frame trembled,
his lips alone grew white, his teeth
were set, and a deep expiration seemed
to chase from his breast the deadly chill
which had entered it. Whatever was
his alarm, he concealed it, and as soon
as he was able to speak, he said in a
tone marked with too much bravado to
deceive a man like Barati, who, accustomed
as he was to collect truth from the
slightest signs, was convinced that fear
was his predominating emotion.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Jean Couteau, I recognized

<!-- page 8 col 1 -->

the strength of your arm in the tree,
for you are a mighty wood-cutter."</p>

<p>"Yes, Galidou," replied the voice, for
the speaker was invisible behind the
holms and briars that concealed him,
"when I wish to scale the summit of
mount Barthelmi, and a fir tree or a larch
bars the way, it soon falls before my
axe; but if the obstacle were a man or
a bear, I should strike it down as easily."</p>

<p>Galidou had by this time recovered
from his first emotion, for he replied with
a sneer.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell whether that is true,
Jean Couteau, for they say that you
choose your path where men are not to be
found."</p>

<p>"Beware," replied the one, who was
addressed by the name of Jean Couteau,
"beware lest you one day cross it."</p>

<p>"Tell me where you pass, and I will
go thither when you please," replied
Galidou, "and it will not be a tree that
I will place across your path&mdash;it will be
a man."</p>

<p>"Enough of bravado on both sides,"
said the councillor, sternly. "Silence, I
pray you, Galidou; let me question this
man."</p>

<p>"At your leisure," said the guide,
leaping from his horse, then, approaching
the fallen tree upon which he placed himself
astride, he added, holding his musket ready:</p>

<p>"Ah, Jean Couteau, it is in vain for
you to hide that bear's skin of yours behind
the branches of your holm; I see
you, and I warn you that if you stir, if
a leaf near you moves, I will send a bullet
through your body. And now you
may talk at your ease."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE AMBUSH.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> councillor had in the meanwhile
prepared his question, and as soon as
Galidou was silent, he said:</p>

<p>"With what intent have you who are
called Jean Couteau, and you avow the
deed, with what intent, I say, have you
felled this tree across our path?"</p>

<p>It seemed as if Jean Couteau consulted

<!-- page 8 col 2 -->

his memory, or perhaps some concealed
adviser, before replying, for he was silent
for a moment. Then he answered:</p>

<p>"My master, the Baron de la Roque,
fearing lest you might pass across his
grounds so hastily as to forget to honor
him with a visit, has directed me to stop
you here, and to pray you in his name
to accept the hospitalities of his castle."</p>

<p>The councillor had not time to reply,
for Galidou cried out at once:</p>

<p>"Your master lies in his throat, if he
says that we have passed across his
grounds. The torrent bounds his domains,
and we are here upon the high
road. Let him who stops us beware
then! I will treat him as I would a
highwayman."</p>

<p>And suiting the gesture to his words,
he was about to fire at Jean Couteau,
who disappeared, by throwing himself
upon the ground, when Barati interposed
a second time, turned aside his musket
with the whip which he held in his hand,
and rejoined:</p>

<p>"And if I refuse to accept this invitation
from the Baron de la Roque, what
will then be the result, master Jean
Couteau?"</p>

<p>Another individual, who until now had
kept himself concealed behind the angle
of a rock, suddenly appeared, while five
or six muskets glittered through the
bushes.</p>

<p>This man replied in a tone almost of
politeness:</p>

<p>"The result, sir, will be, that we shall
be constrained to bring about an accident
here. Your horses will have made a
false step, and you will have been precipitated
into the torrent."</p>

<p>Before these words were ended, Galidou
had crept beneath the enormous pine
which lay across the path, while Langlois
had thrown himself upon his face
behind a bush.</p>

<p>Barati alone remained erect upon his
saddle, and replied:</p>

<p>"The Baron de la Roque must know,
sir, that I visit this district for the purpose
of seeing him, and it matters little
whether the inquiries which I am to
make are commenced with him or with
another. Tell me, then, where and how,
I may cross this torrent, and I will be at
his castle sooner than he wishes perhaps."</p>

<!-- page 9 col 1 -->

<p>Galidou who still kept beneath the
shelter which he had found, suddenly
uttered a prolonged whistle, when a mild
and grave voice replied:</p>

<p>"We are close at hand, just beyond
the issue of the Tunnel. There is no
need of wasting your breath, <i>Fillou</i>,*
we have been in the hollow way for
these three hours, and we saw the <i>roquets</i>
come down from their kennel and Jean
Couteau felled the pine tree, but as the
land here is contested, notwithstanding
your father's claims, we have not shown
ourselves, lest it might be said that we
began a needless quarrel. But if a single
musket shot is fired by the men beyond
the torrent, woe to those whom we
find there, even if the baron's page himself
is among them disguised in the livery
of one of his menials."</p>

<p class="small">[*The term by which a foster-father designates
a foster-son.]</p>

<p>"Fire! fire upon the knaves!" cried
the one who had spoken last to Barati.</p>

<p>A few musket shots were fired and
immediately returned, though no one was
wounded by the hasty volley. All now
withdrew behind some cover, to commence
a regular fusillade. Barati alone
remained motionless, confounded for a
moment by the sudden discharge; his
courage soon returned, however, and he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hold! In the name of the king, of
whom I am here the representative, I
declare him culpable of rebellion against
his majesty who fires another shot.</p>

<p>The name of the king, the commanding
tone of this man, who remained thus
alone, and exposed, before those who attacked
him, arrested even the most furious,
and the individual who appeared to
command the <i>roquets</i> said to them in a
milder tone.</p>

<p>"Hear what this man has to say to
you."</p>

<p>"I have to say that I am in quest of
the dwelling of me Baron de la Roque,
and that for this purpose I need not men
to prevent me, but some one to guide me
thither."</p>

<p>"That is all that we ask, worthy councillor.
Retrace your steps and you will
find a narrow path leading to the torrent.
When there, if you are not afraid to
walk upon a board that we have thrown

<!-- page 9 col 2 -->

from one rock to the other, you can cross
it, and in half an hour you will be at the
castle."</p>

<p>"And I will serve you as a guide,"
said Galidou, rising from the ground.</p>

<p>"You, <i>fillou!</i>" said the grave and
mild voice which had been heard before,
"do not go thither; those enter la Roque
who do not find their way out again."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the young man, "if I
do not find my way out, you will come
and seek me. I have told the councillor
that I would act as his guide, and since
it is his pleasure to enter this den, I will
enter it with him, were it inhabited by
bears instead of dogs."</p>

<p>As he said this, Galidou retraced his
steps, so as to get beyond the reach of his
friends, who might have tried by force
to prevent him from. engaging in this
rash enterprise. At the same moment a
man of about fifty years advanced near
the pine which crossed the path that our
travellers had pursued. In addition to a
musket, which was slung across his
shoulder, he wore at his girdle an enormous
cutlass in a wooden sheath, and
held in his hand a staff, eight feet in
length, which terminated in an iron crook
of sufficient strength to hurl stones of a
considerable weight, if he who wielded
it knew how to handle it skilfully.</p>

<p>"Comte Jos&eacute; de Frias," said this man
to him who had ordered the men to fire,
"I do not charge you to speak to your
master in behalf of Galidou; but he must
come safe and sound from the castle of
la Roque&mdash;dost understand me, Don
Jos&eacute;? They must not touch a hair of
his head."</p>

<p>He stopped, while the individual whom
he had addressed by the name of Don
Jos&eacute;, drew near to the opposite verge of
the torrent, to listen to him more distinctly,
then he added, sinking his voice,
and speaking with an air of mystery:</p>

<p>"You may arrange that together as
you please, but he must come to no harm.
Dost thou hear me?"</p>

<p>The councillor observed the manner
in which the shepherd, (for such he was),
had at first said <i>you</i>, and afterwards <i>thou</i>.
He could see also that the one whom he
called Don Jos&eacute; de Frias, was a handsome
young man of scarcely twenty
years of age, and that he replied by a

<!-- page 10 col 1 -->

sign, disdainful indeed, but affirmative.</p>

<p>"Pastourel," cried Galidou at a distance,
as he approached the plank which
was thrown across the torrent, "you will
tell my father that I am going to reconnoitre
the kennel to find out how we can
enter it."</p>

<p>"Be silent, fool," said the young
comte, as he walked onward along the
opposite side of the torrent. "God knows
that if the baron were to hear you, you
would not escape from his hands with a
shred of sound skin upon your back."</p>

<p>"Be silent, Galidou!" cried the councillor,
"raillery is the weapon of women
and children."</p>

<p>"I obey you, worthy councillor," replied
Galidou in a humble tone, for he
did not regret that one, to whom he could
reasonably submit, should impose silence
upon him, for all that he had said was
prompted by that spirit of bravado, characteristic
of the inhabitants of southern
Europe, which, although it is by no
means a sign of cowardice, sullies even
the most resolute courage.</p>

<p>A gloomy silence followed this tumultuous
scene, and Barati, accompanied by
Galidou, made their way toward the
bridge which had been prepared for their
passage. When the councillor reached
the spot, he stopped; having glanced behind
him, he appeared surprised and indignant,
and called out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Master Langlois! master Langlois!"</p>

<p>"Who are you calling thus?" said Don
Jos&eacute; from the opposite side of the torrent,
"I am directed to conduct you alone to
the castle."</p>

<p>"He whom I am calling sir, is an officer
of the parliament who has been placed
under my orders; his presence is
necessary in the duty which awaits me,
and he must enter the castle with me.&mdash;Master
Langlois!" he then called in a
still louder tone.</p>

<p>"Heh! Pastourel!" cried Galidou,
"beat the bush yonder with your crook,
the bush near the pony, and prick master
Goosequill's sides a little, to make
him hear."</p>

<p>Pastourel took a step toward the spot
thus indicated, when master Langlois at
once made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Ha, friend!" said Pastourel, "if it is
you they are calling, despatch, for it will

<!-- page 10 col 2 -->

not be safe to play the spy here presently."</p>

<p>Although the voice of the speaker was
remarkable for its sweetness and mildness,
his features doubtless gave a serious
meaning to his words, for master
Langlois darted forward, and ran at full
speed toward the councillor.</p>

<p>"You would disgrace the parliament,"
said the latter in a tone of severity, "if
you were any thing but the meanest of
its servants."</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied Langlois, "as
mean as I am, I resign my office, if I
may be permitted to leave you."</p>

<p>"Come on, sir, come on!" said the
councillor, "or I will have you carried
by force."</p>

<p>He then traversed the bridge, and
Langlois, intimidated by his threat, crossed
it after him. Galidou was about to
follow them, when the comte de Frias,
who had reached his hand to the councillor
to assist him in crossing, and who
had just drawn Langlois upon the opposite
border, pushed aside the board with
his foot, before the peasant had ventured
upon it, thus leaving him upon the other
bank.</p>

<p>"Return to your father, poor fool,"
said Don Jos&eacute;. "Neither I nor any one
has sufficient influence in the castle of
la Roque to save you from the danger
to which your insolent boasting might
expose you. Messire Barati needs none
but us to accompany him."</p>

<p>The young man hesitated for a moment,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I have said that I would go, and I
will go!"</p>

<p>Then retiring a few paces, he bounded
forward, and with a prodigious leap, alighted
beyond the torrent.</p>

<p>"<i>Fillou</i>," cried Pastourel, who, standing erect near the fallen pine, had witnessed
this act of temerity, "be prudent;
they have need of you at Lavelanet."</p>

<p>"That is the only word that can impose
silence upon the braggart," said
Don Jos&eacute; to Barati, "his foster-father has
told him that he is necessary to the defence
of his family, and he will be as
careful in preserving himself for this important
duty, as he would have been in
earning a good cudgelling by assuming
the airs of a hero."</p>

<p>"But that does not prove that he wants

<!-- page 11 col 1 -->

courage," said Barati, as he walked onward
with Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"I do not say that he wants courage,
but he is not yet so well satisfied of this,
as to feel no need of making a parade of
his bravery. Before a man has put it to
the test, he would attack saint Michael
to acquire a reputation. There was a
time when I was so myself."</p>

<p>"In that case you have learned prudence
early," said Barati, smiling, with
an air which had nothing offensive to the
comte.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Don Jos&eacute;, with a mien
more serious than could have been expected
at his age. "When a man has
sported with death at every hour of his
life, he is accustomed to despise it, but
he knows likewise that it sometimes
comes too quickly, and at an hour when
it is not expected."</p>

<p>Barati gazed at Don Jos&eacute; in surprise,
but the latter as if desirous of avoiding
his questions, added hastily:</p>

<p>"And besides, sir, for his own sake
and perhaps for yours, command this
young man to keep silence; it is useless
to provoke the lion, when, if unprovoked,
he will scarcely refrain from rending you."</p>

<p>Frias hurried forward to leave Barati
an opportunity of profiting by this hint;
and the latter, remaining behind with
Galidou, extorted an oath from the young
man that he would not brave the baron,
if by chance he were summoned into his
presence.</p>

<p>This point gained, Barati rejoined Don
Jos&eacute;, and the two walked side by side up
the avenue of which we have spoken,
and which led to the castle.</p>

<p>They were followed by the five soldiers,
armed with muskets, who had fired
upon the shepherds, but Jean Couteau
was not among them. The shepherds,
on their side, who had posted themselves
along the Tunnel, to protect the passage
of Galidou, had retired at an order from
Pastourel, who did not however accompany
them. He had lingered upon one
side of the torrent, while Jean Couteau
remained on the other. Pastourel took
a seat upon the fallen pine, Jean Couteau
did the same upon an elevated portion of
the rock, and both kept silence, as if
waiting until the rest were out of hearing.
When the two bands were at a

<!-- page 11 col 2 -->

suitable distance, Pastourel commenced
the conversation. But before repeating
it to our readers, we will draw a sketch
of these two men, each of whom was
quite remarkable in his way.</p>

<p>The one whom we have named Jean
Couteau, was a man of forty years, short
and stoutly built, yet by no means fat.
It was the extraordinary development of
his muscles, that gave to his limbs their
enormous size. His legs were short, and
his arms of a length unsuited to the rest
of his frame. His countenance was destitute
of that expression of intelligence,
which prepossesses the spectator, yet it
was by no means stamped with that air
of ferocity, which, their predatory habits
had impressed upon most of those in the
service of the Baron de la Roque. By
comparing him to a sheep endowed with
the strength of a bull, the reader will have
a just idea of his aspect and his character.</p>

<p>Pastourel, on the contrary, was a man
of lofty stature; the beauty of his profile,
the elegance of his form, the calm
majesty of his attitude, the soft light
which shone in his eyes, would have attracted
the attention of a stranger at first
sight. He was about fifty-five years of
age, and when we speak of his beauty,
we mean such beauty as is suited to advanced
manhood, which as yet exhibits
no signs of decay. But that which was
most remarkable, was the singular sweetness
of his voice and the elegance of his
language when compared with the station
which he held in this barbarous community.</p>

<p>Pastourel, (as his name implied), was
the chief shepherd of Gali, the father of
Galidou. He wore a large felt hat with
a drooping brim, and a goat's skin, cut
in the shape of a scapulary, which, fastened
by a thick leathern girdle, covered
a jerkin of wool. Jean Couteau was apparelled
nearly in the same fashion, except
that the front of his scapulary was
a wolf's skin, and that which covered his
shoulders was composed of the fur of the
fox.</p>

<p>As we have said, the two waited in
silence until the soldiers and shepherds
were at a good distance. Pastourel was
the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jean, why I have remained?"
he said, in a soft tone.</p>

<!-- page 12 col 1 -->

<p>"Yes, yes," replied the other, "it is
on account of the <i>fillou</i>."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Don Jos&eacute; is able
to protect him?"</p>

<p>"Hem!" rejoined Jean Couteau, "who
can tell what ideas may come into the
baron's head? He may send him back
to you with a new coat and a handsome
present, and, then again, he may turn
him out of the castle, naked as a worm
and with cropped ears."</p>

<p>Pastourel breathed a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"You would have done better to have
kept him away," resumed Jean. "The
surest means of leaving nothing in the
hands of the baron is to keep out of their
reach."</p>

<p>"We have met him, face to face, more
than once," said Pastourel, "and he has
carried off nothing from our encounters."</p>

<p>"Except good counsel, by which he
will hardly profit, and once, they say, a
taste of your staff, which he has never
forgiven."</p>

<p>"No, no, Jean Couteau," said Pastourel,
"I did not strike the Baron de la
Roque; but one day when he said that
which he had no right to say of a poor
woman who was unable to defend herself,
I told him that 'all noble as he was,
he had lied,' and as he undertook to beat
me, I defended myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you defended yourself so
well, that for a week he was unable to
move hand or foot."</p>

<p>Pastourel did not reply; he seemed
absorbed in profound thought.</p>

<p>"Jean," he cried suddenly, "Galidou
must be saved."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Jean Couteau,
scratching his head, "but that is difficult.
Why did you not prevent him from
coming?"</p>

<p>"Have I the right to prevent my master's
son from going where he pleases?"
said Pastourel, in a tone marked by deep
and secret grief.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Jean Couteau,
"we will save him, but it must be within
two days."</p>

<p>"Wherefore?"</p>

<p>"Because the baroness has taken it
into her head to have her oratory carpeted
with bear skins, and so I must go
up into the mountain."</p>

<p>"You will tell Don Jos&eacute;, in my name,

<!-- page 12 col 2 -->

that the baroness must do without the
carpet of bear skins, and you must remain
in the castle."</p>

<p>"You are mad, Pastourel, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you, and you will see.
Yet still, if neither you, nor Frias, nor
she, are able to save Galidou, send me
the old signal, and then I will come and
look for him myself."</p>

<p>"You do not go up into the mountain,
then, this year?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; the flocks have lingered
upon the hills later than usual; we have
been waiting for the councillor, that he
might receive the depositions of all the
shepherds, and the complaints of the
fullers."</p>

<p>"Well, now you can depart, for the
devil seize me, if you ever see the councillor
again. The Baron de la Roque
has sworn an oath that he shall not leave
his castle, except to return to Toulouse
in a greater hurry than he came."</p>

<p>"I do not know the councillor Barati,"
replied Pastourel, "but, unless I am
greatly deceived, the baron will find him
a man not easily intimidated."</p>

<p>"In that case, he may never return
to Toulouse,"</p>

<p>"Whatever may happen, forget not
that I must know all."</p>

<p>"Have I ever forgotten my oath, Pastourel?"</p>

<p>"No, Jean Couteau; and never has a
man who daily risks his life so carelessly,
displayed such gratitude for one,
who by mere chance, saved him from
the jaws of a bear."</p>

<p>"It was because on that day I was
not alone upon the mountain. My son
was following me, and if the bear had
despatched me, it had been all over with
Pierrou."</p>

<p>"By the bye, have you any news of
your son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, he is still a private in the
company of the chevalier D'Auterive,
the baron's nephew, and as the captain
is soon to pass some days at the castle I
hope that he will bring Pierrou with
him."</p>

<p>"So much the better, so much the
better!" rejoined Pastourel, in a melancholy
tone, "you can then embrace your
son. You are very happy, Jean!"</p>

<p>A tear stole from the eyes of the

<!-- page 13 col 1 -->

shepherd, and Jean Couteau replied in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"But why do you not some day tell
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Pastourel, rising
in alarm, "we have discoursed enough,
too much, perhaps. Take care lest the
baron should at last suspect our connivance
when he sees his craftiest enterprises
baffled."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau shook his head, and replied.</p>

<p>"No, no, there is no fear of that; your
reputation as a sorcerer is too well established;
he will think that it is the devil
who warns you of all. 'Twas only this
morning that he promised me two hundred
crowns if I would thrust my cutlass
between your two shoulders, and four
hundred if I could bring you alive to the
castle."</p>

<p>"Let him wish rather that I may
never place foot within it. But when he
hears that to-day's ambush has failed, it
may excite his wonder."</p>

<p>"Well! well!" replied Jean Couteau,
"has he not the councillor, and his clerk
into the bargain, and then Galidou besides?
He will not think to ask if you
were here, ready to defend them. Besides,"
added Jean, "he is not always in
a condition to comprehend what is said
to him."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, after supper. But before
supper, do not trust him. He is like
some deaf men who hear more than one
would have them."</p>

<p>"Is it that master Gali&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! master Gali is my master," said
Pastourel, "and he is what he is. Adieu,
Jean Couteau, and forget nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing, say you? Oh, there are
not so many things to be done, that I
should forget them. He, in the first
place&mdash;he, in the second&mdash;he, always.
Let me but save him, and I shall have
forgotten nothing."</p>

<p>"One word," said Pastourel. "The
comings and goings of all these strangers
who nightly visit the castle, have ceased,
have they not?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately, for if the councillor
found them here, it would be a very different
affair from that of your master!
And although they hold their consultations
in the upper chamber, yet at times

<!-- page 13 col 2 -->

I have heard words that smell of heresy
a league around."</p>

<p>"Still the baron is a good catholic,"
said the shepherd, carelessly.</p>

<p>"He worships that saint who will restore
him the rights of pasturage which
the king has granted to you, in order to
encourage the manufacture of cloth in
this district, which has been ruined by
the departure of the protestants, who, to
say the truth, have carried with them
the best part of his revenues."</p>

<p>"So then," said Pastourel, "you suspect
that the baron would favor a protestant
movement in the hopes of regaining
his rights."</p>

<p>"God grant," cried Jean Couteau,
"that the councillor may not amuse
himself by visiting the upper chambers!
He might be astonished at the piles of
arms and ammunition that are stored
therein."</p>

<p>"He would be much more astonished
if he were to visit the vaults," muttered
Pastourel, in an under tone.</p>

<p>But Jean Couteau did not hear these
words, which seemed to have escaped
Pastourel involuntarily, and the old shepherd
added:</p>

<p>"Well, Jean, keep your suspicions to
yourself, for if they were to reach the
ears of the parliament, it would not only
cost the baron dear, but the chevalier
D'Auterive also, and your son Pierrou."</p>

<p>"Pierrou!" cried Jean Couteau. "Ah,
I can answer for him; he would sooner
burn all the Huguenots of the province
than meddle with such a thing, and I do
not see how he could have aught to fear
from the discovery."</p>

<p>"Jean," replied Pastourel, "you are
too old a huntsman not to have found a
wolf in the glen, when you thought you
were near the den of a bear."</p>

<p>"You are right, perhaps, for strange
things are going on in the castle, and it
is on that account that I have suffered
Pierrou to enlist. But he has nothing
to do with it&mdash;has he?"</p>

<p>The voice of Jean Couteau seemed
agitated, both by alarm and indignation.
He feared the power of Pastourel, and
still he would not have hesitated to quarrel
with him, if his son had by any
chance been the victim of his diabolical

<!-- page 14 col 1 -->

influence. Pastourel understood him,
and replied mildly:</p>

<p>"By my soul's welfare, your son is
as innocent of all crime against God and
the king, as the illustrious Duke de
Nevers, the governor of the province."</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a tone of
raillery, which Jean Couteau did not remark,
for he replied:</p>

<p>"I believe you; and still what you
have said has frightened me. Listen,
Pastourel! I will save Galidou, should
it cost me my hide; but if any evil
threatens Pierrou, you will avert it, will
you not?"</p>

<p>"I promise you!" said Pastourel, in a
tone of emotion.</p>

<p>With these words Pastourel waved his
hand to Jean Couteau, and both withdrew
in such haste that it was evident
they willed to overtake their comrades
before they reached the place to which
they were hurrying. Jean Couteau,
rushing onward like a wild boar, through
bushes and thickets, succeeded in his
design, for he rejoined his fellows at a
short distance from the castle.</p>

<p>His absence had not been unnoticed,
however, for Frias said to him in a stern
tone:</p>

<p>"What errand had you on the borders
of the torrent that kept you there till
now?"</p>

<p>"I think," replied Jean Couteau, "that
you heard the promise the baron made
me this morning, if I could lay hands
upon Pastourel."</p>

<p>"That is to say, if you killed him,"
said Frias.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, two hundred if I killed
him, and four hundred, if I took him
alive."</p>

<p>"And you pursued him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Jean, "and he
has been twice within reach of my cutlass."</p>

<p>"And you did not kill him?" said
Frias.</p>

<p>"I prefer the four hundred crowns to
two."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Don Jos&eacute;, in a
low voice, "slay him, and I will give
you four hundred crowns, in addition to
those the baron has promised you."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau was stupefied at this
proposition, but he imagined that the

<!-- page 14 col 2 -->

comte's only object was to rid the baron
of a man whom he feared; and notwithstanding
the inferiority of his station, he
replied in a tone of contempt:</p>

<p>"Why did you not send a bullet
through his body a moment since? for a
man can not approach Pastourel exactly
as he wishes; he saw me behind him,
and looked at me&mdash;you know how he
looks at one, as if he saw into one's very
soul&mdash;and he spoke to me in words which
I do not comprehend. 'You will tell
Don Jos&eacute;,' he said, 'that he must inform
the baroness that she has no need of a
carpet of bear skins for her oratory.' "</p>

<p>"He told you that?" cried Frias, with
a movement of alarm.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye! he told me that; and he
added: 'You must remain at the castle.' "</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered Frias, "this man is
a sorcerer; hell waits upon his bidding,
that is sure."</p>

<p>Then he added, with strange agitation:</p>

<p>"Well, then, you will remain at the
castle?"</p>

<p>With these words he left Jean Couteau,
and rejoined Barati, who was examining
with extreme attention the approaches
to the castle, elevated as it was
upon the summit of a hill, and surrounded
by ditches whose width and depth
formed an obstacle not easily to be surmounted,
although they were completely
dry.</p>

<p>The drawbridge, which led to the only
apparent entrance to the castle, was
lowered, as if the occupants expected
their arrival. No sooner had the last
of those who accompanied Barati entered
the fortress, than the drawbridge was
raised, with a noise and din of chains,
which startled Langlois, and which
caused Frias to shrug his shoulders, as
if he disapproved of this threatening demonstration.</p>

<p>Barati turned, scanned the drawbridge
and the portcullis, which was lowered
with the same display, and he said to
Frias, as the latter invited him to follow
him:</p>

<p>"This is contrary to the order of the
king."</p>

<p>"That is an observation which you
can make to the Baron de la Roque,"
replied Don Jos&eacute;, "for you are about to
be admitted into his presence."</p>

<!-- page 15 col 1 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE BARON DE LA ROQUE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> now traversed a vast court,
and entered a vestibule, in which they
found a score of bandits wearing military
coats, although they carried no
arms, except a long, wide rapier, suspended
by a baldric, upon which were
embroidered the arms of the Baron de
la Roque. A number of muskets were
carefully arranged in a corner, and a
boy astride a drum was playing with the
drumsticks. From the impatience which
Frias manifested at all this display, Barati
inferred that he looked upon this
parade of rebellious force as imprudent,
or perhaps he found it ridiculous. Still
Don Jos&eacute; did not speak, and the councillor,
turning to a hallebardier who
seemed to be on guard, said:</p>

<p>"Announce our arrival to the baron."</p>

<p>The hallebardier, who was probably
unaccustomed to the part which was imposed
upon him, laid aside his weapon,
opened the folding doors, and cried out
in a ludicrous tone:</p>

<p>"Baron de la Roque, here are visitors!"</p>

<p>As Barati entered the hall, he said to
Frias:</p>

<p>"This seems like a poor comedy."</p>

<p>"Take care," replied Frias, "lest it
become a tragedy."</p>

<p>The appearance of the apartment into
which Barati, his secretary, and Galidou
were ushered, was calculated to give
effect to these words. It was a vast,
wainscotted hall. Torches, fastened
against the walls, illuminated it with a
glare, which appeared the more gloomy
to Barati, when contrasted with the light
without, for every window was entirely
closed, and the few rays of day which
found their way through the shutters,
were intercepted by long curtains of red
velvet. In the middle of the hall stood
a large table covered with the same material,
and behind this table, upon which
were placed two lights, each with three
branches, sat the Baron de la Roque.</p>

<p>No judgment could be formed of the
height of this man's stature, but he seemed
endowed with prodigious strength; his
broad chest, crossed by his folded arms,

<!-- page 15 col 2 -->

his powerful neck and large head, gave
him an appearance well calculate to
inspire alarm. But it was chiefly when
the spectator examined his features with
attention, that he was unable to repress
his terror. A low forehead, surmounted
by white and bristling hair, heavy eyebrows,
which almost concealed his grey
and bloodshot eyes, a nose hooked like
the beak of a vulture, a sunken mouth
and pale lips, which disclosed a set of
teeth, narrow, long and pointed, like
those of a wild beast; a square, projecting
chin, denoting the brutal appetites of
this man&mdash;all these features made up an
image, upon which was stamped the impress
of craft and cruelty, nay, almost
of blood-thirstiness. The baron was
dressed with a sort of splendor; the embroidery
and fashion of his garments had
probably been in vogue some twenty
years before the date of our narrative,
and if he did not present the idea of a
gay and gallant lord, he manifested at
least an air of command and confidence
in his own strength, which told with sufficient
clearness that he was a man of
power and authority.</p>

<p>Upon a low stool, but at the extreme
end of the table, sat a young man, clothed
in black, before whom stood the implements
necessary for writing. Behind
the baron, and standing at his right, was
a menial, bearing upon a silver plate a
pitcher and goblet of the same material.
On his left, and stationed with an affected
show of menace, stood a man with bared
arms, clothed in red serge, and leaning
upon an axe. Farther off, and ranged
in a semicircle around the table, sat a
score of men, like those whom Barati
had encountered in the antechamber, except
that each of them held a drawn
sword in his hand. Lastly, at some distance
from this group, near a high and
wide chimney place, in which a bright
fire was burning, a young woman of great
beauty was seated in an arm chair, covered
with crimson velvet; her feet rested
upon a cushion, which served as a seat
for a little girl of three years of age, who
gazed at all this array with an air of
astonishment, which proved that, to her,
at least, the scene was a very unusual
one.</p>

<p>Although Barati had at glance scanned

<!-- page 16 col 1 -->

all the personages in this picture,
and although from the awkwardness of
some, and from the embarrassment of
the young woman, who in vain affected
an air of indifference, he understood that
all this was a spectacle, arranged to inspire
him with alarm, yet he was not the
less disturbed by apprehension. The
chief cause of this emotion was the aspect
of the Baron de la Roque. It is
true that at the instant when Barati entered
the apartment, this man had resolved
not to push matters to extremities,
but his visage denoted him as one of those
individuals who easily overleap the
bounds of that moderation which they
have prescribed to themselves, and who,
when once a prey to their evil passions,
immolate victims to their blind rage,
without heeding the danger. Barati
measured the peril, and we shall soon
see the resolution with which it inspired
him.</p>

<p>The councillor, followed by Galidou
and Langlois, had advanced to the edge
of the table. Then, seeing that the baron
remained motionless, he looked toward
the lady, who regarded him with restless
curiosity, saluted her profoundly,
and then, turning to the baron, placed
his hat upon his head again. The old
noble did not appear to notice it, but Don
Jos&eacute; and the headsman, for it was he
who stood at the baron's left, were troubled
at seeing the old lord reach his right
hand over his shoulder to demand the
goblet, which his cup-bearer filled to the
brim with wine. To those who knew
the Seigneur de la Roque, it was a sure
sign that this proceeding had irritated
him, for he had just put in practice one
of his favorite precepts: "A man should
always drain a cup of wine between the
anger which he feels, and the first word
which he speaks."</p>

<p>To a certain point this precept was not
amiss, and twice or thrice its application
might be salutary, but this number passed,
the palliative became a furious stimulant,
and it was precisely in the cases
in which the baron carried his system
of moderation to excess, that he committed
the most fearful outrages. It was
not strange, then, that the young man
and the dame appeared so terrified. As
to the other personages, they lived in so

<!-- page 16 col 2 -->

profound and constant awe of the baron,
that this circumstance could neither increase
nor diminish it. Jean Couteau
alone gave utterance to a growl of disapprobation,
which, fortunately for him,
was drowned by the baron's laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Jos&eacute;, you are a fine
youth! I asked but one prisoner, and
you have brought me three. This one
is the councillor, doubtless; as to the
fellow yonder who trembles so, it is some
cur of the parliament's base court, I suppose;
and you, rogue, who stand so erect
in my presence, who are you?" he said,
addressing Galidou.</p>

<p>The latter, in whose eyes this spectacle
was a serious affair, and who had felt a
death-like chill creep through his veins
as he entered the hall, had placed himself
in an arrogant attitude, in order to
conceal his alarm; but when the baron,
fixed upon him those eyes, that glistened
like a wild cat's, his voice failed him,
and very opportunely, as he would have
replied by some rude insult, for the very
reason that he was terrified, and heaven
only knows what would have followed.
But Don Jos&eacute; de Frias answered quickly:</p>

<p>"This one, my lord, is a peasant,
who served as a guide to the councillor
and his secretary."</p>

<p>Galidou, ashamed of his hesitation,
advanced a step in order to reply, when
Barati, stretching out his hand, said in a
calm and commanding tone:</p>

<p>"There is no one here who has the
right to speak, but I, the representative
of the king of France and of the parliament."</p>

<p>The baron dropped his brows over his
eyes, which now shone in their deep
orbits like two bright and bloody points,
and exclaimed violently:</p>

<p>"You shall have the right to speak
when I question you, base gownsman!
Who are you, and what brings you upon
my domain?"</p>

<p>The councillor in his turn, fixed a
firm and dignified glance upon the baron,
and replied in a voice in which neither
fear nor anger was evident:</p>

<p>"Adrian Anselme Joutard Baron
de la Roque, I have come upon your
domain, by order of parliament, to interrogate
you; you and those who inhabit
it, concerning the misdemeanors and

<!-- page 17 col 1 -->

crimes committed daily upon the inhabitants,
shepherds, spinners, weavers
and fullers of the village of Lavelanet,
which crimes and misdemeanors are
imputed to you, to you, Baron de la
Roque, and to the men in your service."</p>

<p>The amazement of the baron alone
permitted Barati to speak at such length,
and suspended for a moment the ire of
the old seigneur. He was so greatly
surprised to find himself interrogated
and accused&mdash;he who had resolved to
enact a representation of that feudal jurisdiction
which his ancestors formerly
exercised in this castle, that he remained
for a while confounded and stupefied,
but as if the current of his blood and
of his anger, arrested for an instant, had
rushed on with increased violence, he
became perplexed, and cried with a tone
that thundered with fury:</p>

<p>"Do you not know, wretch, to whom
you speak? Do you not know where
you are? Do you not understand that
you are in my power?"</p>

<p>"I am in the castle of the Baron de
la Roque, who is accused of robbery,
of pillage, of public devastation, and I
am here to question him."</p>

<p>The baron was seized with a convulsive
tremor.</p>

<p>"Langlois," resumed the magistrate,
without deigning to notice the baron,
whose lips foamed with anger, and who
clutched mechanically the handle of a
pistol that lay before him, "Langlois,
sit at this table, and write down the
answers which the baron will make to
the questions which I am about to put to
him."</p>

<p>Langlois was morally incapable of
obeying him, but the habit of hearing a
similar order, acted upon him mechanically,
as it were, and he took a step toward
the table.</p>

<p>"Drive out yon mangy hound!" cried
the baron, suffocating with anger. "Begone,
knave!" he added, half rising from
his seat, and seizing a long staff that
rested against the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"Master Langlois," said Barati, in a
voice that echoed through the entire
hall, "wind about your neck the chain
which you wear as a clerk of the parliament,
and let who will lay hands upon you,
I declare him guilty of high

<!-- page 17 col 2 -->

treason, for having insulted an officer
charged with the execution of its
justice."</p>

<p>The unhappy Langlois, who wore his
chain beneath his jerkin, passed it about
his neck, while the baron cried with wild
fury:</p>

<p>"Tie him with his own paltry bauble,
and knit him up in the antechamber!
Cast the carrion into the moat!"</p>

<p>The men who stood behind the baron
gazed at each other, and made a movement
in advance. Barati continued:</p>

<p>"Langlois, take your place at this
table, and write down the baron's
answers. Do your duty, sir, do your
duty. In the king's name, obey!"</p>

<p>Whether impelled by the magic of this
name, or by the tone of authority in
which the councillor had addressed him,
or by the habit of obedience to which
we have referred, Langlois seated himself
at the place pointed out to him.
The men who were about to lay hands
upon him retreated, and the baron, who
had risen with the staff in his hand, fell
back upon his chair as if confounded
and dismayed.</p>

<p>"A seat, young man" said Barati,
turning to Galidou, who, comprehending
this lofty and energetic resolution, had
felt the emptiness of his own bravadoes.
He took a chair at random, and brought
it to Barati, who seated himself in front
of the baron, but at some distance from
the table, while the latter, having recovered
from his first stupor, cried in a hollow
voice:</p>

<p>"Fill! fill! fill!"</p>

<p>The baron drained three goblets of
wine, and like a knight who for a moment
unhorsed, seats himself again in
his saddle, he glanced upon Barati with
eyes in which anger and menace flashed
with redoubled fury. Barati endured
this glance without flinching. There
was a moment of terrible silence.</p>

<p>"Baron de la Roque," said Barati,
"various complaints have already been
made against you before the bailiwick
of Foix, for the numerous misdeeds
which I am about to rehearse to you.
Whether from negligence or from fear,
the judges of this town have not attended
to the grievances of the inhabitants,
whom it was their duty to protect, and

<!-- page 18 col 1 -->

the latter have addressed themselves
directly to the parliament, which has
entrusted to me the care of investigating
and prosecuting the affair. Prepare,
then, to answer me."</p>

<p>Probably the libations of the baron
had inspired him with some happy idea,
for he gazed at the councillor with a
smile of ferocious joy, as the leopard
watches the heedless bounds of the fawn,
which he is sure to seize at a single leap,
and the stern noble muttered between
his teeth:</p>

<p>"The man is mad! by my life, he is
mad!"</p>

<p>Owing to this change in the baron's
mood, the councillor was enabled to
proceed without violent interruption.</p>

<p>"The following are the facts," he
resumed, drawing out a parchment from
which he proceeded to read.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of the village of
Lavelanet, devoting themselves to the
manufacturing of cloth and serge, keep
numerous flocks of sheep, which they
send in the summer season to browse
upon the mountains, held in fee by the
said village. Now, these flocks,
which are with difficulty preserved from
beasts of prey, have been often dispersed
and scattered by the Baron de la Roque,
and driven into glens, ravines and forests,
like animals of the chase, some
smitten to death by the Baron de la
Roque or his dependents, others throttled
by his greyhounds; some driven by fear
into inaccessible abysses, others wandering
through the woods, a prey to wild
beasts."</p>

<p>The baron, still busied doubtless with
his happy thought, planted his elbow upon
the table, supported his chin in the
hollow of his hand, and listened with a
scornful air to this recital, accompanying
it with slight nods in the affirmative.
Barati raised his eyes, and observed these
movements.</p>

<p>"Proceed, proceed, sir!" said the
baron with a sneer.</p>

<p>"In addition to this, the inhabitants of
the said village, have established for the
fabrication or their cloth and serge, six
fulling mills upon the different streams
of water, here below designated upon a
map which they have had prepared by
a skilful surveyor. In order to protect

<!-- page 18 col 2 -->

the said mills against sudden freshets, they
have raised dykes, bulwarks, conduits,
and other works of wood and stone, and
at various times the said works have
been injured, and one of them, belonging
to a person named Galidou, has been entirely
destroyed by the dependents of
the Baron de la Roque."</p>

<p>The patience which the old castellan
had imposed upon himself seemed to
draw to a close, for Barati, having
paused for a moment, he addressed him
no longer with insulting raillery, but
with an air of ill-repressed indignation.</p>

<p>"Have you nearly finished?"</p>

<p>"Almost, sir," said Barati, coolly.</p>

<p>He resumed his task with a voice as
calm and firm, as if he were reading
an inquest before the parliament.</p>

<p>"Beside these acts, which have inflicted
serious damage upon the inhabitants,
the said Baron de la Roque has
arrested, or caused to be arrested, divers
mules and horses laden with merchandise,
belonging to various inhabitants of
the town, and chiefly to the aforesaid
Galidou, and the said baron has kept
possession of the merchandise."</p>

<p>"Is this all?" cried the baron in a
hoarse voice, as with his accustomed
sign he demanded his goblet.</p>

<p>The councillor continued without allowing
himself to be disturbed.</p>

<p>"Finally several shepherds having
resolved to defend their flocks against an
attack from the baron, one of them
named Pierre Laniou, was wounded in
the head by a sword stroke dealt by the
baron, from which stroke he fell dead on
the spot."</p>

<p>The baron's teeth chattered with
rage, his hands trembled, and he muttered
in a repressed voice:</p>

<p>"And he will not be the only one!"</p>

<p>The councillor did not hear him, and
continued to read, but with a rapidity
that one uses in rehearsing a concluding
formula which is usually appended to
such documents, after the enumeration
of the important facts.</p>

<p>"In consequence of all the grievances
which have just been rehearsed, the inhabitants
of the village of Lavelanet, after
having addressed themselves to the baron,
who has answered them neither as a
just man nor as a gentleman, have had

<!-- page 19 col 1 -->

recourse to the parliament, in order&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that you have read?" cried
the baron, quickly, as he rose and displayed
for the first time his lofty stature;
"what is that you have read?" he repeated,
bending over the table upon
which he supported himself with one
hand, while with the other he reached
towards the parchment which Barati
was reading, as if he wished to take it
from him&mdash;"what is that you have
read?"</p>

<p>"I have read what is written, sir
baron."</p>

<p>"And these boors have said that I
have answered them neither&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither as a just man nor as a gentleman,"
said Barati; placing his finger
upon the line where these words were
written.</p>

<p>The baron drew himself up to his
full height, and with flashing eye, bristling
hair, and foaming lips, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"To horse, my men! to horse! take
torches and arms. By to-morrow's
dawn, not a house of these knaves shall
be standing. They shall be reduced to
ashes; all&mdash;to the very last. Burn, slay
without ruth or rue. Away! away!
and speed ye!"</p>

<p>So violent was the baron's fury, so
indignant the accent of his voice, so
imperative the tone of his command, that
some of those who were in the hall hurried
out to execute his orders.</p>

<p>This burst of anger, and above all, the
direction which it had taken, had so astonished
Barati that he stood for an instant
motionless, following the baron with
his eye, who had dashed aside the chair
upon which he had been seated, and was
now striding up and down the hall like
a madman. Barati, rising also, turned
at last to Don Jos&eacute;, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Is there here no reasonable man to
whom I can explain the orders of the
parliament?"</p>

<p>At these words the baron stopped suddenly,
and with less fury than could
have been expected, he said to the
councillor:</p>

<p>"The orders of the parliament, sir!
What have the orders of parliament to
do here? I do not know them, and I do
not wish to know them! In truth, it is
shameful to the king, to the nobility, that

<!-- page 19 col 2 -->

causes are to be judged by men wearing
black or red robes! What has brought
you here? what would you? How
dares a man who calls himself a judge,
utter the follies contained in that idle
piece of parchment? How could a
parliament of Toulouse credit such a
complaint? How could a parliament
permit a score of boors to say and to
write that I have not answered to their
grievances as a gentleman?"</p>

<p>At these words the baron ground his
teeth, and added with his former fury:</p>

<p>"But do you know, sir, the meaning
of these words? Do you know what has
passed? Do you know that among this
scum, there has been found a wretch, a
madman, a vile peasant, so audacious
as to send me a challenge; me, Baron de
la Roque, declaring me, if I refused to
answer it, unworthy of the title of a
gentleman. And still, persuaded as I,
was that it was some madman, I have
not sought out this fellow, I have not
hung him upon a tree by the road-side.
And this is the injury that these boors
have dared to draw up as a grievance,
in a complaint to parliament! and parliament
receives it! Did you know the
facts, sir? did you know them when
you read that insolent document?"</p>

<p>"I knew them, sir," said Barati,
calmly, "and he who has appealed for
justice to another source than parliament,
will be punished if there is occasion
for it."</p>

<p>The baron gazed at Barati as if it
were a maniac who spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Punished, if there is occasion, sir,
you say? And thus the meanest of
wretches shall be at liberty to insult
me? and the parliament will judge
whether I must endure the affront or
not! Am I an old woman, that such
things may be said to me? And the
parliament of Toulouse has thought and
believed that I would permit it, without
punishing the bearer of so insolent a
message! Sir, sir! prepare to ask pardon
upon your knees, here, on the instant,
before all present, or <i>mordieu!</i>
sir councillor, parliament will have a
more serious affair to settle than a mere
clamor of peasants."</p>

<p>"The affair has become sufficiently
serious for you, sir baron," replied Barati,

<!-- page 20 col 1 -->

"inasmuch as you have ventured
to address to me this insulting proposition."</p>

<p>"Do you see that man?" replied the
baron, whom drunkenness and anger had
entirely deprived of reason and reflection,
as he pointed to the headsman who
stood near them leaning upon his axe,
"do you know who he is? do you know
that I have but to deliver you into his
hands, and it is all over with you and
your comrades?"</p>

<p>Barati gazed for a moment at the
headsman with a calmness that disturbed
him, then turning quietly toward the
baron, he replied:</p>

<p>"Whoever he may be, sir baron, I
need not think of him yet; not until I
have pursued my investigation concerning
those who have aided you in the acts
of which you are accused, will I enquire
how far he is guilty as an accomplice."</p>

<p>The councillor, when he uttered these
words, had scarcely a hope of preventing
a deed of violence by his firmness, yet
at the risk of his life, he resolved to perform
the duty which devolved upon him
in maintaining his character as a judge.
Accordingly he did not speak with that
air of command which he had worn until
this moment. The baron saw a sign
as he thought, in the tone with which
Barati had addressed him, and wishing
to complete his victory, he replied with
an air of sarcasm and cruelty:</p>

<p>"This man is the headsman of the
Baron de la Roque; and you see," he
added, pointing to the weapon upon
which he was leaning, "the axe is
weighty and sharp."</p>

<p>Barati, overcoming the disgust inspired
by the drunkenness rather than
the anger of the baron, cast a contemptuous
glance at the weapon to which the
castellan pointed, and answered haughtily:</p>

<p>"The axe of the parliament, sir baron,
is more weighty and sharper than that
of La Roque. He who wields it does
not grow pale beneath the glances of
those whom the parliament delivers into
his hands, and yet he has severed loftier
heads than yours; and the blood of the
Duke de Montmorency should teach
those who listen to me, that rebellion can

<!-- page 20 col 2 -->

not escape him, even if armies or a whole
province stood at its service."</p>

<p>This mention of the high jurisdiction
of the parliament startled the old castellan,
although it recalled a somewhat distant
epoch; but, above all, it disturbed
those who had counted upon the baron's
influence to excuse their obedience to
him, and as the vassals whom he had
ordered to prepare torches reappeared at
this moment, an air of general discontent
was visible.</p>

<p>During this scene, notwithstanding
Barati's sense of his own personal danger,
one thing struck him as singular;
neither Jos&eacute; nor the baroness made a gesture
or uttered a word to interfere. They
watched with evident anxiety indeed, the
different currents of the baron's anger,
but without seeming to fear the consequences,
whatever they might be.</p>

<p>"We are ready, my lord," said one
of the armed vassals, who had entered
with torches in their hands.</p>

<p>"It is well!" cried the baron. "Let
us away, and until my return let these
three men be fast locked in the prison.
I will decide to-morrow what I will do
with them."</p>

<p>"One moment, Baron de la Roque,"
said Barati, placing himself in his way;
"in the duty which has been entrusted
to me, parliament has foreseen that you
might refuse to answer, and the case has
been provided for. Do you express this
refusal in form?"</p>

<p>The baron shrugged his shoulders, but
did not reply.</p>

<p>"Your silence," resumed Barati, "is
evidence of a refusal. In this case, I,
Leonard Barati, councillor of the parliament
of Toulouse, arrest you, commanding
in the name of the king, all here present
to lend me their aid; and I declare
those who refuse, to be rebels, and I reserve
to myself the right of prosecuting
them, and bringing them to punishment
as such."</p>

<p>The baron retreated a step. Every
body remained motionless.</p>

<p>"Is there not here one faithful subject
of the king?" cried Barati.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>"Langlois," said Barati, "note down
what has passed. You will read it to the
baron, and then we will withdraw, to pursue

<!-- page 21 col 1 -->

our enquiries immediately elsewhere."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the
emotions of the old seigneur at this display
of unalterable calmness, upon which
all threats and danger were unable to
make the least impression. To render
them comprehensible to our readers, we
must explain their origin.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE KENNEL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Seigneur de la Roque had
learned that a councillor of the parliament
had been sent into the district to
make an inquest, he imagined, as in general
all men of the sword, and all those
who live by the employment of brute
force, are inclined to imagine, that he
was about to deal with some fat civil
judge, who would swoon at the sight of
a musket, and who would consider himself
very fortunate in escaping from his
hands by proclaiming him innocent of all
the crimes which were imputed to him.
Perhaps, as we shall see hereafter, he
had still more serious motives for throwing
obstacles in the way of this investigation.</p>

<p>He had consequently arranged this
theatrical representation, in order to terrify
the miserable judge whom he had
expected. But the scene, which was
intended but for a comedy, had suddenly
changed its character, as Don Jos&eacute; had
foreseen from the judgment he had formed
of Barati, when he arrested him.
Accordingly the danger had been actual
from the very commencement of this
singular interview, but at this moment it
had become more imminent than ever.
On the one hand, the baron's anger and
mortification had reached their height,
and on the other he was not altogether
willing to place himself in a state of open
rebellion against the parliament. He
regretted his foolish attempt to intimidate
the councillor, yet he felt at the same
time that he had gone too far to escape
the severest censure, and he asked himself
if it were not better now to push
matters to extremity. He seemed to

<!-- page 21 col 2 -->

count the men who surrounded him; one
would have said that he was following
out in his thoughts a plan of revolt already
long prepared. But whether the
wine which he had drunk had confused
him, or whether he hesitated to form so
dangerous a resolve, he cast himself upon
his chair, bending his head, as if in
thought, while from time to time he
reached his hand toward his cup-bearer
without uttering a word. This gesture,
without doubt, was familiar to the menial,
for he understood it, and each time
he poured out a full goblet for the old
castellan, who drained it at a draught.</p>

<p>Langlois, who was writing with a
trembling hand, now and then cast a side
glance at this pantomime, and it filled
him with alarm. Still no one spoke;
profound silence prevailed in the apartment;
nothing was heard but the scratching
of the pen upon the paper, when the
baron caught the stealthy glance which
Langlois cast upon him, and as if this
glance had kindled the rage which
glowed within him, he started up like a
madman, struck Langlois to the earth,
seized the paper upon which he had been
writing, tore it, trampled it beneath his
feet, and exclaimed, in a paroxysm of
rage:</p>

<p>"Hold, scurvy hound! vile scrivener!
Thus I value your justice and the justice
of the parliament! Seize that man, and
bind him," he added, pointing to Barati.
"Do as I bid you!" he cried, placing
his hand upon his sword, "Set on!" he
said, pushing his vassals toward the
councillor, without venturing himself to
approach him.</p>

<p>A general tumult ensued, during
which Jean Couteau hastily approached
the councillor.</p>

<p>"Follow me, for heaven's sake!" he
cried, "the leash is broken, and the mad
dog bites all within his reach."</p>

<p>Barati would have resisted, but Jean
Couteau made a signal to two men, who
threw themselves between him and the
baron, and endeavored to drag him from
the apartment; while two others raised
Langlois, who lay stretched upon the
ground, complexly stunned by the blow
which he had received.</p>

<p>The baron brandished his sword, crying
with all his might&mdash;"Bind them!&mdash;to

<!-- page 22 col 1 -->

the dungeon with them! I will deal
with them!" and thus increased the
confusion. Jean Couteau availed himself
of it to say in a whisper to Galidou:</p>

<p>"Follow me, if you would not be
hung!"</p>

<p>The scene which had just passed had
so absorbed the young man's attention as
to render him forgetful of himself, but as
soon as he found himself an object of
notice, he resumed his boastful assurance,
and replied:</p>

<p>"I do not fear your baron's gibbet, no
more than I fear your cutlass, Jean Couteau."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words,
when Don Frias, who until now had remained
motionless, rushed towards him,
and while he endeavored to conceal him
from the eyes of the baron, said, pushing
him onward violently:</p>

<p>"Go, wretch, go!"</p>

<p>"By St. Peter!" said Galidou, "if we
were alone, face to face, in a fair field,
you would not treat me thus, without
paying dear for the insult."</p>

<p>"Wilt go, fool! madman!" said Jean
Couteau, seizing Galidou by the shoulders;
and, clasping him in his arms of
iron, he strove to drag him from the hall.</p>

<p>Although Jean Couteau was endowed
with almost herculean strength, yet he
had to deal with a youth too vigorous
and too active, to suffer himself to be
borne away like a child. Accordingly
Galidou, whom Jean Couteau had lifted
from the ground, planted his feet against
the frame of the door at the moment
when the latter was about to thrust him
into the antechamber; and owing to this
point of resistance, he hurled Couteau so
violently backward, that he fell to the
ground, bearing his burden with him.</p>

<p>They rolled together to the baron's
feet, when Galidou leaped up nimbly.</p>

<p>"<i>Peste!</i>" said the seigneur, bursting
out into a drunken laugh, "the knave
has stout hamstrings. Ha! Jean Couteau!
you look as if you were stunned
with the fall." Then turning to Galidou,
he added: "Come, fellow, if you
will enter my service I will give you
fifty crowns a year. What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Pierre Lescuret," exclaimed Jean
Couteau, with strange eagerness.</p>

<!-- page 22 col 2 -->

<p>"Yes, my lord," said Frias, who, although
astonished at the ready invention
of Jean Couteau to save Galidou, was
resolved to profit by it. "Yes," he
said, "Pierre Lescuret, a poor madman,
who is fit only to serve as a guide to
travellers."</p>

<p>Any one but Galidou would have seen
in these words a settled design to save
him, but the young mountaineer, who
had lately made a trial of his prudence
in keeping silence during the discussion
of Barati and the Seigneur de la Roque,
and in resigning his due share of the
baron's anger&mdash;Galidou, we say, looked
upon it as a point of honor to refuse the
protection of a false name, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My name is not Pierre Lescuret!&mdash;my
name is Andr&eacute; Galidou!"</p>

<p>An exclamation of vexation escaped
at once from the lips of Jos&eacute; and Jean
Couteau, while the rest of the baron's
attendants gathered eagerly around the
young peasant. This universal curiosity,
should it cost him his life, (and nothing
was more likely), delighted Galidou; he
placed himself in the middle of the hall,
with his head erect, and his hat cocked
upon one side.</p>

<p>As a hound, which would have courageously
leaped at the throat of a fox,
if he had met him free in the woods, but
which, if he finds him taken in a trap,
snuffs about him with distrust, snapping
at him from time to time, and then retreating
to a distance, so was it with the
baron when he held Galidou in his
power. He walked around him, holding
his sword in his hand, and pricked him
slightly, measuring him from head to
foot with his eye, and saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! this knave, then, is Andr&eacute;
Galidou!"</p>

<p>The latter leaped backward, and
placed himself in an attitude of defence;
the baron's men were about to rush upon
him.</p>

<p>"Gently! gently!" cried the baron,
"do not hurt him; the dog must be hung
all alive, and whole."</p>

<p>The young braggart turned pale, not
so much at the idea of death as at the
baron's savage scorn.</p>

<p>"Ha!" resumed the latter, "it is the
dung-hill bird who sent me the cartel!
You must take an ass's girth and halter,

<!-- page 23 col 1 -->

for he does not deserve to be beaten with
the lash of a noble hound. We shall
see if his skin is as ticklish as his courage.
Ah, <i>mordieu!</i> I need not now go
to fire the hovels of these boors of Lavelanet;
here is sport enough for us to-night,
and all day to-morrow."</p>

<p>This incident had arrested the councillor's
departure, and when he heard
the baron speak thus, he thought it base
to abandon one, who, whether from ostentation
or from honor, had insisted upon
accompanying him. Barati advanced,
therefore, to the Seigneur de la Roque,
and said:</p>

<p>"If this young man has been guilty
of any offence toward you, he shall be
punished as he deserves."</p>

<p>"You may be sure of it, master councillor,"
said the baron, in a savage tone.</p>

<p>"But he is not a vassal of yours,"
replied Barati, "and you can exercise
no authority over him."</p>

<p>"Master Barati," cried the baron,
whose purple visage expressed the most
savage ferocity, "I will have him flayed
alive&mdash;I will cast him to my dogs&mdash;I will
hack him in pieces if it pleases me, and
neither king, nor parliament, nor the
whole world shall hinder me."</p>

<p>The councillor, who, in face of such a
threat would have raised his head aloft,
had it been addressed to himself, replied
in a mild tone:</p>

<p>"If you would permit me to remain
alone with this young man, I could persuade
him, I hope, to ask pardon at your
hands."</p>

<p>Galidou, who had been for a moment
struck dumb at these terrible threats,
seemed suddenly to rouse himself at the
word "pardon," for it touched his vanity,
and he cried:</p>

<p>"Ask pardon of a mad wolf? No,
no, worthy councillor! When a man
meets one in a glen, he slays him, and
that is what I should have done the first
time the baron passed within reach of
my musket. He may flay me alive,
roast me, and eat me afterwards if he
pleases; the message I sent him is not
the less true, and I repeat it to his face;
he is good for nothing but to let loose his
<i>roquets</i> in the night against cottages, in
which there are none but women and
children, or against flocks of sheep; but

<!-- page 23 col 2 -->

as to trusting himself alone with a man,
he with his sword, and I with my staff,
or with nothing, if he wishes it, he dares
not do it! I have said it, and I repeat
it; he is nought but an old toothless
wolf, who runs as soon as a good shepherd's
dog shows his teeth."</p>

<p>In the baron's present condition it appeared
impossible but that such an insult
should lead at once to some sanguinary
result, but the old seigneur listened to it
as to something that had no power to
reach him.</p>

<p>"Ho, there! my good Galidou," he
cried, "you have just put an idea in my
head. A week ago I found an old wolf
in a pit-fall, whose teeth are something
loose and blunted. He is now in a large
iron cage in the kennel of the great court.
<i>Pardieu</i>, it will be pleasant sport to loose
you, one against the other, and to see if
you will make the brave beast turn his
back."</p>

<p>"Sir Baron," said Barati, "it is a
barbarous sport."</p>

<p>"It will be so, sir," replied the baron,
with a smile and a glance of ferocity;
"it will be so! So much the worse if
you are in a hurry. Your business
must wait for that of this clown's. Do
as I have directed you," he added, turning
to his attendants, "place these gentlemen
in the dungeon, and yonder knave
in the kennel, and let him have something
to eat. He will need all his strength
to-morrow for the encounter."</p>

<p>He then added harshly:</p>

<p>"Follow me, Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>The latter bowed, and cast a glance
upon the young woman, who rose and
left the hall. The baron went out without
waiting for a reply, and Barati followed
the two men, who walked before
him and Langlois, and who thrust them
into a kind of damp cellar, where they
found themselves in total darkness.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau approached Galidou,
and said, in a rude tone:</p>

<p>"As for you, follow me to the kennel,
and pass the night in prayer to God, that
he may send one of his saints to save
you from the jaws of the wolf."</p>

<p>"I need but my two hands for that,
Jean Couteau."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," said the other, "as to the
wolf with the four paws, I believe it.

<!-- page 24 col 1 -->

though 'tis a rude beast; but it is the
wolf with two feet that will not loose his
hold upon you."</p>

<p>"We shall see!" said Galidou, who
now seriously repented of his imprudence,
but who, at the risk of his life,
would not exhibit the slightest sign of fear.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau, followed by a few domestics,
led Galidou across a large court,
and approached a small tenement, in
which were enclosed a dozen dogs, who,
aroused at the sound of steps and the
glare of torches, began to bark and howl
most frightfully. Galidou, who, until
this moment had advanced with a resolute
step, suddenly paused, as he saw
Jean Couteau prepare to open a low gate,
and he could not prevent himself from
saying:</p>

<p>"Are you going to shut me up with
these famished beasts?"</p>

<p>"Do not fear," said Jean Couteau,
"if they are to eat you, it will not be to-night."</p>

<p>As he said this, he opened the gate,
and twelve or fifteen large dogs rushed
towards it.</p>

<p>"Back!" cried Jean Couteau with the
voice of a Stentor, and at the word the
whole pack slunk away, and resumed
their places upon the straw which was
strewn around the walls, uttering angry
growls, which echoed on all sides. Jean
Couteau took a torch from one of the domestics,
saying:</p>

<p>"Go, and attend to your own affairs!
Do you think I need aid to keep these
dogs quiet, and to shut up this stripling?"</p>

<p>Galidou, who had been thrust into the
kennel, found himself in a large chamber,
vaulted above and paved beneath.
At the right of the gate at which he had
entered, and raised to about half the
height of the apartment, he beheld a cage
of iron, nearly six feet square. From the
top of the cage an enclosure of boards
reached to the roof, forming, consequently,
a kind of loft, in which there was a
wretched mattress. This cage was that
in which, at the time when the Baron de
la Roque kept a complete pack, they secured
those hounds, which, from their ferocity,
were dangerous to others, and the
loft was occupied by the menial who had
charge of the kennel. It was in this
cage that the wolf was confined, which

<!-- page 24 col 2 -->

Galidou was to contend with on the morrow,
and it was in the loft that he was to
pass the night.</p>

<p>The young man could not avoid casting
a glance upon the ferocious animal,
which had withdrawn to the back of its
cage, with ears erect, and disclosing its
long, blackish teeth.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau took a small ladder, and
placed it against the cage.</p>

<p>"Mount up there! and quickly!" he
said to Galidou.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated, and as the domestics
had now retired, he felt tempted
for a moment to seize Jean Couteau by
the throat, hurl him to the around, and
thus endeavor to escape. But as this
would be no easy task against a man endowed
with the strength of Couteau, and
as the strife would doubtless have excited
the dogs to rush upon the combatants,
and to tear them both in pieces,
Galidou paused.</p>

<p>"Mount!" repeated Jean Couteau,
"and when you are once aloft, draw the
ladder up after you, for otherwise the
hounds would soon be at your heels."</p>

<p>"And you think that the baron will
force me to fight with the wolf to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"He will do as he has said," replied
Jean Couteau, "unless you contrive to
tear away one of the bars of the window
that admits light into the loft in which
you are to sleep, and then you will find
it easy to creep through the opening, and
glide into the court."</p>

<p>"Is that true, Jean Couteau?" said
Galidou.</p>

<p>"I can tell you one thing, and that is,
you have only to try it, for nothing
worse can happen than what has been
promised you."</p>

<p>"But suppose that I could descend into
the court, it would be necessary for
me to find my way out of the castle."</p>

<p>"Perhaps someone may be at hand
to conceal you. Perhaps, also," continued
Jean Couteau, as if struck with a
sudden thought, "perhaps it would be
better to keep quiet. It is an old story,"
he added, as if speaking to himself,
"and perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Galidou.</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that you have only
to keep quiet, and above all, do not cry

<!-- page 25 col 1 -->

out if any one comes here in the night."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"You will see. Come, come, mount!
despatch, for they may come to hear
what we are talking about so long."</p>

<p>Galidou ascended the ladder; Jean
Couteau withdrew and closed the gate.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">PAULA.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> this scene was passing between
Galidou and Jean Couteau, Jos&eacute; had followed
the baron to his chamber. The
old man was still burning with indignation,
but he repressed it, and when Jos&eacute;
said to him:</p>

<p>"What service can I render you, my
lord baron?"</p>

<p>The latter glanced upon him with an
air of vulgar cruelty, and replied:</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;, are you capable of an honest
action?"</p>

<p>The baron's manner was so at variance
with his words, that Frias felt convinced
that he was about to propose to
him the commission of some crime. He
preserved his calmness, however, and
replied:</p>

<p>"There is nothing which I am not
capable of undertaking for the honor of
your house."</p>

<p>This answer did not appear to please
the baron, for he rejoined abruptly:</p>

<p>"I am sole judge of the honor of my
house, and all that I ask of you is to tell
me, whether you are ready to do my
bidding without farther inquiry."</p>

<p>"My lord baron," replied Jos&eacute;, after
a moment's reflection, "I am ready to
do all you command, but upon one condition."</p>

<p>"A condition, sir! Do you speak of
imposing conditions upon me? Do you
forget that you are in my service?"</p>

<p>The young man reddened at this word.</p>

<p>"Baron de la Roque," he said, "when
my father the Comte de Frias sailed for
the Indies, he placed me in your hands
as a ward, and not as a vassal. I have
performed the duties of page in your
dwelling, and although my age should
have called me to a different occupation,

<!-- page 25 col 2 -->

yet I wished to testify my gratitude toward
you; but do not forget that I am
your equal in rank. If you are willing,
I am ready to conclude a bargain with
you, provided you grant what I desire
in return for that which you demand."</p>

<p>"And what do you desire of me?"
said the baron with a gloomy air.</p>

<p>"That will depend upon the service
which you expect of me. When you
have mentioned it, I will inform you of
my desire."</p>

<p>The baron reflected, and after a long
silence, he replied:</p>

<p>"Be it so, Jos&eacute;, be it so! You are
young, and it is quite likely that you have
desires which I have overlooked, perhaps.
Aye, aye, I will give you money, and
the permission to spend it after your own
fancy. Is this your desire?"</p>

<p>"My lord baron, what I desire depends
upon the service you have to require
of me."</p>

<p>"You will do what I require, Jos&eacute;, for,
after all, you are as deeply compromised
as I am. Have you not arrested upon
the high road this mule of the parliament,
who is deaf to all reason? These
gownsmen of Toulouse are the men to
make a serious thing of that which was
but a jest&mdash;for it was but a jest, you
know, Jos&eacute;, my good friend, although I
appeared to be very much in earnest and
very angry."</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," replied Frias, "I believe
that it was intended for a jest; and
why not tell him so? that would suffice&mdash;why
not ask his pardon?"</p>

<p>The Seigneur de la Roque started at
this word.</p>

<p>"Ask his pardon!" he" cried. "You,
Frias, a nobleman, talk of asking pardon
of a vender of decrees! No! not if they
should strike me with the axe of Montmorency!&mdash;and
of what use would it be
now? Do you think if he ever leaves
this castle, this croaking councillor will
not enter a complaint against me? and
then, God knows what would come of it!
No, that is not the way to manage it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," replied Don
Jos&eacute; "but what have you resolved
upon?"</p>

<p>"You are very stupid this evening,
Jos&eacute;," rejoined the baron.</p>

<!-- page 26 col 1 -->

<p>"It is because I am afraid to understand
you."</p>

<p>The baron shrugged his shoulders,
and replied:</p>

<p>"Ha! <i>mon dieu!</i> it will be their own
fault. Do you think, if, at this moment,
you were to go to the councillor and his
scribe, and tell them in your name, or in
that of the baroness, that you are afraid
I may commit some violence, and that
you counsel them to escape secretly from
the castle, do you think that they would
hesitate?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my lord baron, although
the councillor does not look like a man
easy to be intimidated."</p>

<p>"I tell you that he trembles in his
shoes," replied the baron, roughly.
"And he has good reason; for in one
way or another, I must be rid of him,
and he will be very dexterous or you
very awkward, if his foot does not trip
in crossing the torrent."</p>

<p>"It may be so," replied Don Jos&eacute;,
"but Galidou is an active fellow, and
strong enough to carry them across this
dangerous passage upon his shoulders."</p>

<p>"Who speaks of Galidou, Jos&eacute;?" said
the baron; "he will never leave the castle,
I answer for it."</p>

<p>"But, my lord baron," rejoined Jos&eacute;,
"it was a jest, also, was it not, when you
said that you would make him fight with
the old wolf?"</p>

<p>"A jest, sayest thou? No, no! and
well for the clown if the wolf throttles
him at the first leap, for if he outlives
the combat, I will tear out his teeth singly,
and his hairs one by one. I would
rather butcher the judge and his scribe
with my own hand, I would rather let
him escape, though he should stir up all
parliament against me, than to lose this
Galidou!"</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; turned pale at these words, and
arming himself with all his courage, he
replied:</p>

<p>"Well then, sir baron, the first and
the only condition upon which I am
ready to serve you is this, that you do no
harm to this Galidou."</p>

<p>After all that the baron had said, it
was an act of great boldness in Frias,
to demand thus formally the life of the
culprit. The old man remained silent
for a moment, as if doubting whether he

<!-- page 26 col 2 -->

had heard aright. A few scornful exclamations
escaped his lips, then fixing
a stern and suspicious glance upon Frias,
he replied:</p>

<p>"You consent to dispose of the judge
and his scribe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," said Frias, in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p>"And in return, you claim the life
of Galidou?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;, you are a traitor!"</p>

<p>"Sir baron!"</p>

<p>"I have long suspected it. There is
some treachery on foot. You turn pale.
Don Jos&eacute;! you tremble, Comte de Frias!"</p>

<p>In truth, at the word "treachery," the
young man's limbs shook beneath him.</p>

<p>The baron grasped him violently by
the arm.</p>

<p>"You have listened! you have played
the spy upon my secret interviews!"</p>

<p>"I?" said Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"You know that a rebellion of the
protestants is on the eve of breaking out,
and you would use the secret against
me."</p>

<p>The glance of amazement which Don
Jos&eacute; cast upon the baron at these
words, admonished him of his imprudence,
and affecting the hesitating utterance
of a drunken man, he added:</p>

<p>"Aye! aye! it is true! I do not wonder
now that the shepherds have been so
often warned of my projects! It is you
who have betrayed them! you!"</p>

<p>The above alarm, which had for a moment
disturbed Don Jos&eacute;, at once vanished
at this accusation, and he exclaimed
with ardor:</p>

<p>"My lord, I am no traitor. If the
shepherds have discovered your designs
it is because they have watched them
carefully; if they have often defeated
them, it is because you have often entrusted
them to others beside myself.
For the rest, it is useless to inquire into
the motives of my demand. You require
a service of me, and I tell you the
price at which I am willing to render
it. If you are not content with this,
seek out another, who will serve you
more faithfully than I have done until
this day."</p>

<p>"It would not be difficult to find one,"
said the baron. "Retire, but forget not

<!-- page 27 col 1 -->

that if the prisoner should by chance
escape, it is you who will be answerable
for it."</p>

<p>"I am not your jailor, baron."</p>

<p>"You are, if I wish it, and I do wish
it. Take a musket, a sword, take any
weapon whatsoever, and go watch at the
gate of the prison in which this wretch
is confined. You shall guard him! it is
my will that you should! and obey!
obey at once! and forget not that if he
escapes, I will expel you from the castle
as a traitor."</p>

<p>This threat produced a singular effect
upon Don Jos&eacute;. An air of keen vexation
passed across the young man's face;
he reflected for a while, and at last said
to the baron:</p>

<p>"Well, my lord, I consent to obey. I
will watch at this gate, but promise me,
that, if Galidou come off conqueror from
his encounter with the wolf to-morrow,
you will spare his life."</p>

<p>"I do not refuse," rejoined the baron.
"The request is not unreasonable, and I
would be just before all things. As to
the councillor and his scribe, since you
refuse to listen to my proposal, I will decide
upon their fate to-morrow."</p>

<p>"As you think best, my lord."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; now withdrew, and the baron
walked to and fro in the chamber, muttering
aloud:</p>

<p>"What interest can Don Jos&eacute; have in
the safety of Galidou? Would he betray
me for these peasants? No, no!
he hates them too sincerely. Still I have
heard it said that this boor has a sister
of uncommon beauty. It was the baroness
who told me this. During the lifetime
of the Sire de Labastide, this young
girl often went to the castle, and Paula
has spoken of her to me with enthusiasm.
If that is so, I was wrong in sending
him to guard the prisoner; he will
suffer him to escape. At his age what
will not a man do for the woman whom
he loves? I must look to it lest he aid
Galidou to evade my power."</p>

<p>The Seigneur de la Roque, contrary
to his custom, left his chamber, and went
to see what was passing in the court.
For this purpose he did not cross the
outer hall and vestibule which led from
his chamber, but followed a long gallery
upon which opened all the sleeping

<!-- page 27 col 2 -->

rooms of the castle. He was in the act
of passing his wife's chamber, when he
heard the sound of voices. The baron
paused suddenly, and extinguished the
light which he held in his hand. This
movement seemed prompted by jealousy.
Of all the male inhabitants of the castle,
but a single one could have attracted
the attention of the baroness, and this
one was Don Jos&eacute;. The baron resolved
to listen; he could hear the speakers
engaged in earnest conversation,
but was unable to distinguish a single
word. Patience, nay, even prudence,
was no feature in the baron's character;
he tried to open the door, and found it
locked. Irritated by this circumstance,
he pushed against it with such violence
that it gave way, and he beheld Don
Jos&eacute; standing before him.</p>

<p>Without reflecting, without inquiring
into the cause of his presence in this
chamber, the baron was about to rush
upon the young man, sword in hand,
when the child of whom we have spoken,
leaped from her mother's lap, and running
to the baron, cried in a tone of entreaty:</p>

<p>"Papa, do not kill the shepherd, Jos&eacute;
does not wish it, and he has been crying,
and begging mamma to save him."</p>

<p>This innocent testimony as to the cause
of Don Jos&eacute;'s presence in Paula's chamber,
arrested the baron, whose pride was
not the less wounded, however, at having
manifested the emotion and the suspicion
which had disturbed him. He gazed
for a moment at the two, and but for the
words just uttered by a child scarcely
four years of age, he would have been
convinced that he had surprised a secret
which closely touched his honor, so great
was the agitation of Paula and the handsome
page. As we have said, the baron
had left his chamber in the belief that
Jos&eacute;'s anxiety for Galidou's safety arose
solely from his love for Catharine, the
shepherd's sister. It was under the influence
of this belief that he said to
Frias:</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>, master Jos&eacute;, your love must
be warm to spur you to this insolence&mdash;to
enter by night into the chamber
of the baroness!"</p>

<p>If the seigneur instead of gazing at
Don Jos&eacute;, had glanced at Paula, his

<!-- page 28 col 1 -->

former suspicions would have returned;
a livid paleness spread across her features,
and a glance in which were
blended hatred and despair, flashed from
Don Jos&eacute;, to the baron, as if she would
have urged the young man to assail her
husband.</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; however replied with considerable
calmness:</p>

<p>"I know that my presence here needs
an excuse, but it is owing solely to my
desire to save young Galidou."</p>

<p>The baroness bit her lips, frowned
and said in a tone of bitterness:</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. Don Jos&eacute;, I know
not wherefore, has been suddenly
seized with so passionate an interest for
this clown, that if you had entered a
moment sooner, you would have found
him on his knees, praying and weeping
as if for his own life."</p>

<p>"It is true," said the child, "he cried,
and mamma told him to begone."</p>

<p>"If it were for my own life, madam,"
said Jos&eacute;, "I should not have entreated
with tears; it is for more than my life, it
is for my honor."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; uttered these words in a tone of
profound sadness, and cast a suppliant
and despairing glance upon the baroness.
The baron interpreted his grief according
to his former suspicion, and turning
to his wife, he said, with a smile:</p>

<p>"This astonishes you, Paula, and certainly
it is a thing to cause surprise, but
love has subdued ruder hearts than that
of our page Don Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" exclaimed
Paula, in a tone which might
have been caused by sudden terror or
offended prudery.</p>

<p>"Well, well, do not be angry, Paula;
your confessor will absolve you, if by
chance our words offend your chaste
ears. Yes, Paula, see to what love has
reduced the callous Don Jos&eacute;! he weeps
at your feet to save the brother of a
paltry maiden, whom you would not
suffer to approach you."</p>

<p>The flashing eye of the baroness wandered
for a moment, alternately from
her husband to the young man, as if to
demand an explanation of these words.
Don Jos&eacute; himself had not clearly comprehended
the baron's meaning, and he
gazed upon him steadfastly. The baroness

<!-- page 28 col 2 -->

was the first to break this singular
silence.</p>

<p>"What mean you, my lord? Whom
do you term a paltry maiden? Is it
Catharine Gali?"</p>

<p>The baron nodded. Paula continued
in a changed and hollow voice:</p>

<p>"It is for the sake of Catharine Gali
then that he would save Galidou!"</p>

<p>"This young girl has been almost
reared in your father's castle," said
Jos&eacute;, addressing the baroness in a faltering
voice. "I hoped that your friendship
for her would interest you in behalf of
her brother."</p>

<p>The baroness had cast her eyes to
the ground, and if the light of the solitary
taper which burned in the vast
chamber, had sufficed to illuminate her
face, her husband would have remarked
the profound agitation of her features,
and the rage and despair which she was
unable to subdue. Fortunately for her
the baron came to her aid, and replied:</p>

<p>"That is craftily done, master Jos&eacute;,
to count upon the friendship of the baroness
to further the love which you feel
toward the beautiful Catharine. You
have acted like a loyal gallant, in good
sooth, for you have carefully concealed
the secret motives which prompted your
pity for Galidou."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; hesitated for a moment, and then
answered with more firmness:</p>

<p>"No, baron; the safety of Galidou
seemed to me an act of justice. I addressed
myself first to you and you
refused me; then as I thought it an
act of pity and benevolence also, I applied
to you madam, and you have not
yet answered me."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the baroness, in a tone
of raillery, "it is the beautiful Catharine,
for she is beautiful, she was so, at
least, some years since&mdash;it is the beautiful
Catharine whom you love!"</p>

<p>"I do not love Catharine, madam,"
said Don Jos&eacute; with vexation, "but I
wish to prevent a deed which I consider
culpable, and more dangerous to us all
than you imagine."</p>

<p>"In truth?" said the baron with
a sneer. "It is the danger which would
result from Galidou's death which
troubles you? And how is it that so
an adviser could consent a moment

<!-- page 29 col 1 -->

since to rid me of a councillor of
parliament, a deed far more hazardous,
and that upon condition that I would
spare this wretch?"</p>

<p>"Is it so?" cried the baroness, in a
voice which caused the young man to
tremble, "Don Jos&eacute; has consented to
commit a murder in order to save the
brother of Catharine?"</p>

<p>"He has," said the baron, with the
same sneer.</p>

<p>Frias appeared to be on the rack. At
last, as if weary of dissimulating, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir baron, Galidou must
be saved and I ask it of you as a recompense
for my services; and you,
madam, in the name of the ties you
hold most dear, in the name of your
child, implore the life of this young
man, I conjure you. God will recompense
this act of mercy more bounteously than
you think, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Comte De Frias!" cried the baroness
between her closed teeth.</p>

<p>"Consent, madam!" replied Jos&eacute; earnestly,
"consent! save this shepherd,
save him!"</p>

<p>"Your love blinds you, Don Jos&eacute;,"
said the baron in a stern but not indignant
tone; "you should be sufficiently
familiar with the strict views of the baroness
on such subjects, to know that she
must look upon your prayers in favor of
a graceless maiden as an insult. Retire
then, and to convince you that I have no
wish to reduce you to despair, I promise
that on the morrow, I will give Galidou
all reasonable means to come safe and
sound from the combat. He shall be
furnished with a cutlass and a staff, and
if with these weapons he does not rid
himself of the old wolf in a minute or
so, he does not deserve the interest you
take in him. Come, Don Jos&eacute;, you can
inform him that he owes this favor to
your intercession."</p>

<p>The baroness sat motionless, with
drooping head and glazed eyes; she
seemed no longer to hear what was said.</p>

<p>"Madam!" said Jos&eacute;, bending upon
his knees before her. She drew backward
with an air of terror, and Jos&eacute;,
turning to the child, said, with tears in
his eyes:</p>

<p>"Charlotte, dear child, beg your

<!-- page 29 col 2 -->

mother to save this young man, beg her
sweetly, I pray you, my pretty Charlotte!"</p>

<p>The baron gazed at Jos&eacute; with an air
of stupefaction, while the child replied
with tears:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, mamma will save him!"</p>

<p>"You know," said Jos&eacute;, addressing
the little girl, "you know that he is protected
by the old sorcerer, and that this
man can do every thing, and cast wicked
spells upon little children."</p>

<p>The baroness glanced at Don Jos&eacute;
with an air of mingled pity and contempt,
as if she believed in the reality
of his fear. In the meanwhile the
baron hurried Don Jos&eacute; toward the door
of the chamber, saying:</p>

<p>"You are mad, Jos&eacute;. How can you
say such things to a child? Go, go!"</p>

<p>He then added, as if he had found an
infallible means of consoling him:</p>

<p>"We will free you from all blame in
Galidou's death, if it so happens that he
dies, and as with this sort of people, the
girls share in the heritage, it will be
quite a good match, it will help to repair
your poverty, for the boor is rich."</p>

<p>"If Galidou dies," cried Jos&eacute;, who
was now without the chamber, "God
help us all!"</p>

<p>He added a few words that were not
heard, for the baron at once closed the
door.</p>

<p>"Well, baroness, what do you think
of the matter?" said the Seigneur de la
Roque.</p>

<p>"It is for you to act as you see fit."</p>

<p>"True, true!" said the baron "but
when I remember the love I felt for
you, Paula, I pity this poor Jos&eacute;, and
if you on your side are interested in
Catharine, I would consent, perhaps, to
release this knave, after having inflicted
upon him a punishment which he would
not forget very easily."</p>

<p>"I have no advice to give you in this
affair, baron. It is for you to decide
how far it becomes you to favor your
ward's passion for a milkmaid."</p>

<p>The baron shrugged his shoulders,
and replied with more mildness than
could have been expected of him:</p>

<p>"In sooth, Paula, you are too severe
toward this young man. I do not attribute
it to malice, but when you became

<!-- page 30 col 1 -->

mistress of this castle, I thought that
you would bring joy and pleasure with
you, but it is now more gloomy than
ever. Your devotion is extravagant,
Paula; it renders you too strict and censorious.
I am called the Wolf of la
Roque, I am looked upon as harsh and
brutal, and I will not deny that I have
often inflicted cruel punishment upon
those who have offended me, but I confess
that Jos&eacute;'s love and despair have moved
me. It reminds me of my youth;
I suffered then as he does."</p>

<p>"Baron," replied Paula, in a cold and
haughty tone, "I will excuse you from
making me the confidant of your amours
with the peasant girls of your domains."</p>

<p>The baron bit his lips, and replied
with a sad and severe accent:</p>

<p>"You have ever been virtuous, Paula,
and you are too proud of it. God
grant that you may never have a fault
with which to reproach yourself, for
you would meet with no pity, you, who
have pity for none."</p>

<p>Paula crossed herself at these words,
and replied, dropping her head on her
bosom:</p>

<p>"Baron, I have need of repose, I
have need of prayer this evening; I
have never demanded of you any other
liberty than that of attending to my
devotions; shall I not obtain it?"</p>

<p>"At your pleasure, Paula," said
the baron, "at your pleasure. Pray to
God as often as you will. For my part
I also feel disposed to devotion this evening,
and to do my duty as a Christian,
and therefore I will pardon Galidou;
this will have as much worth, perhaps, in
the eyes of the Lord as to move the lips
often, while not a generous emotion stirs
the heart for a single moment."</p>

<p>"You are master of your actions,
my lord," replied Paula, rising.</p>

<p>The baron understood this movement,
and turning toward the door, he said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, good evening! permit
me to light my lantern by your taper,
and I will go at once, and bear the
news to Don Jos&eacute; and to Galidou."</p>

<p>The baroness started; she endeavored
to be silent, but impelled by that spirit
of sarcasm which few women know how
to check, she replied:</p>

<!-- page 30 col 2 -->

<p>"Why do you not send a messenger
to the beautiful Catharine to inform her
of the success of Don Jos&eacute;'s prayers?"</p>

<p>The baron was upon the point of replying
to this ill-timed pleasantry, when
suddenly frightful cries were heard in
the court, and almost at the same moment
Don Jos&eacute; appeared, pale, haggard,
wild, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"He is dead! he is dead, madam!
torn, devoured by your dogs!"</p>

<p>"It is not possible!" said the baron,
terrified at such a death.</p>

<p>"Come and see the scattered remnants
of his body! his torn garments! come,
come, baron!"</p>

<p>The court-yard suddenly resounded
with the baying of dogs, and loud above
all were heard the howls of the old wolf.</p>

<p>"But how has this happened?" said
the baron. "How do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding your orders, yes, sir,
notwithstanding your orders, I resolved to
save this young man; I went to the
kennel; I opened the door carefully! I
entered; and to my horror I beheld your
dogs feeding upon remnants of palpitating
flesh; I tried to chase them away,
but drunk with blood, they turned and
attacked me, and but for my sword I
should have fallen a victim to their fury.
Some of your vassals then came up
with torches and we recognised the remains
of Galidou's body and the shreds
of his garments; the poor fellow was
not in the loft, and we found the ladder
against it; he must have attempted to
escape, and perished by a most frightful
death."</p>

<p>The baron clasped his head with both
his hands, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is it possible? are you sure of what
you say?"</p>

<p>"The gate was locked, and the ladder
leaning against the loft."</p>

<p>"Ah! we must at least tear the remains
of this unhappy youth from these
ferocious animals. I will go thither;
I will go thither!" said the baron.</p>

<p>He at once left the chamber of the
baroness, and hurried into the court.
When there, a frightful spectacle met
his eye. The dogs had escaped from
the kennel, each bearing away a portion
of bloody flesh, which they dragged
along the court, while the menials,

<!-- page 31 col 1 -->

armed with whips pursued them, but
without being able to make them resign
their booty.</p>

<p>"Where is Jean Couteau?" cried the
baron.</p>

<p>A dozen voices called Jean Couteau.
The latter replied from the window of
a hay-loft, and said in a piteous tone:</p>

<p>"I attended to your order, my lord.
I made him ascend into the loft, I saw
him draw up the ladder and I warned
him besides, not to descend; it is not my
fault."</p>

<p>"Who says it is your fault?" replied
the baron in a gloomy tone. "But the
dogs know you better than any one else;
get them into the kennel again, and let
these remains be collected in a coffin
that they may at least be buried in holy
ground."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau descended, but, whether
it were that his alarm overpowered him,
or that he failed to give the usual emphasis
to his threats, or that the dogs, gorged
as they were with blood, did not recognise
his voice, some time elapsed before they
were driven into the kennel, and before
the menials could collect into a chest the
fragments which they tore from their
jaws. The baron, disturbed by a gloom
and anxiety, such as he had never felt
till now, remained in the court until the
last dog was driven in, and then turning
to Jean Couteau, he said:</p>

<p>"Go for father Anselmo, of the convent
of the Franciscans. Do not tell him
what has happened, but bid him be here
at break of day."</p>

<p>"To do that I must be able to leave
the castle."</p>

<p>"I will go to my chamber and get the
keys, I will myself let you out at the
postern gate."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau appeared vexed at this
precaution; he replied, however, in a
tranquil tone:</p>

<p>"In that case, my lord, permit me to
dress myself, for I was sound asleep
when this din commenced."</p>

<p>"<i>Mordieu</i>," cried the baron as he
retired, "I do not know if I shall ever
have the courage to see a stag embowelled
again, and to cast its humbles to
the hounds."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau suffered a suppressed
chuckle to escape him, and clambered

<!-- page 31 col 2 -->

up to his loft with the rapidity of a
leopard, while the baron returned to
his chamber through the great hall,
the scene of his interview with Barati.</p>

<p>During this while an interview of a
very different character was passing
between the baroness and Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>The child, who had remained awake
much later than usual, had at last fallen
asleep in an arm-chair, thus leaving
them at liberty to pursue their conversation
without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"So then, Don Jos&eacute;," said the baroness,
in a tone of bitter raillery, "the
brother of the beautiful Catharine has
been devoured by the baron's dogs."</p>

<p>"Yes, Paula," said Jos&eacute;, "and it is
not Catharine's brother alone, it is not
the poor peasant alone, that they have
destroyed; they have destroyed your
life and mine, and perhaps that of this
child."</p>

<p>"In good sooth, you are mad, Jos&eacute;!"
said the baroness in a low and tremulous
voice. "How are my honor and my life
connected with the welfare of this boor?"</p>

<p>"You are resolved not to understand
me, Paula; you would not understand
me when I begged you to save him; you
listened to a foolish conceit of the baron's;
you listened to your jealousy, to your
hateful suspicions, and Galidou is dead!
Woe to us both!"</p>

<p>"And wherefore?" rejoined the baroness,
"why should his death bring us
woe? What? you, who consented to
assassinate a councillor of the parliament,
you, who beheld no danger therein, except
for the baron, do you think we are
lost because a peasant has met his death
by accident?"</p>

<p>"It is because of one thing which I
have not dared to tell you, Paula, during
these five years, it is because there lives
a man who is in possession of the secret
of our fault, and of the birth of this
child."</p>

<p>The baroness stood erect and motionless;
except that her eyes, which were
open, darted fearful glances, a spectator
would have thought that all life had completely
left her, she was so pallid and so
cold.</p>

<p>"There lives a man," she said stammering,

<!-- page 32 col 1 -->

"who knows that I, the daughter
of the Vicomte de Labastide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jos&eacute;, dropping his eyes
before her flashing glance, "and this man
is Pastourel, Galidou's foster-father; and
when this fool followed me to the castle,
he placed him under my protection,
Paula, and at a word from him I understood
the vengeance with which he threatened
me, if misfortune happened to him
whom he loves as a son. And this son
is dead, this son has perished in the most
horrible tortures!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" rejoined the baroness, still
gazing steadfastly upon Don Jos&eacute;, and
uttering a kind of suppressed murmur,
"oh, there is a man who has known the
secret of my life for five years! a man
who has held my honor in his keeping
for five years! And this man still lives?
Jos&eacute;," she added, in a tone of fury, "you
are a coward!"</p>

<p>Frias bent his head, and replied in confusion:</p>

<p>"This man is proof against lead and
steel&mdash;this man is a sorcerer."</p>

<p>"You are a coward Jos&eacute;!" resumed
the baroness.</p>

<p>She then seized a <i>couteau de chasse</i>,
which lay upon a table near at hand, and
exclaimed wildly:</p>

<p>"And where is he to be found? this
man who is proof against lead and steel!"</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; gazed at the baroness with a terror
replete with admiration; with her
flashing eye, her lofty brow, her lips
parted and trembling, the cutlass gleaming
in her hand, Paula looked strangely
beautiful. The inspiration of despair
which had prompted her question, passed
like an electric spark from the soul of the
baroness to that of her lover. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Wherever he is I will find him,
Paula; and wherever I find him I will
force him to eternal silence!"</p>

<p>The desperate energy which had fired
the baroness, vanished as if by magic,
and dropping the weapon which she held,
she replied:</p>

<p>"Yet to what end, Jos&eacute;, to what end?
It is too late! it is too late! Besides,"
she added, with an expression of gloomy
scorn, "you would shrink now, as you
have shrunk before. You are not a man,
Comte de Frias; you can fly, and I counsel

<!-- page 32 col 2 -->

you to do so. As for me, I am resolved
to die!"</p>

<p>"No, Paula, you shall not die!" cried
Jos&eacute;. "This man"&mdash;his voice trembled
as he spoke, "this man&mdash;I will slay him
to-morrow&mdash;this night! I will slay him,
Paula! take courage!"</p>

<p>"You will slay him?" rejoined Paula,
in a hollow voice. "Are you sure of
saving me by it?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, at least."</p>

<p>"Alas! and that is all you can promise
me? a hope!&mdash;And still what is
this man, who can but accuse, in comparison
with him who can punish?"</p>

<p>"Paula," said Don Jos&eacute;, in a trembling
voice, "Paula, I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Your paleness tells me that you understand
me, Jos&eacute;. Go! leave me, sir!
Do you not hear the footsteps of the Baron
de la Roque returning to his chamber?"</p>

<p>"Paula," replied the young man,
"wait until to-morrow evening, and then
banish me from your presence, if you
are not satisfied with what I have done."</p>

<p>"Adieu henceforth, Jos&eacute;! adieu for
ever!"</p>

<p>"Oh, say not that, Paula! I shall see
you again! To lose you would be death!"</p>

<p>"Speak lower then, Comte de Frias!
That is my husband leaving his chamber."</p>

<p>She paused, but her eyes, which were
fixed upon those of Don Jos&eacute;, turned
slowly toward the cutlass which gleamed
upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Jos&eacute;, starting forward
as if to seize it. But he stopped,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"No, never! And still I will save
you!"</p>

<p>He rushed headlong from the chamber,
while Paula muttered in a hollow voice:</p>

<p>"Coward! coward!"</p>

<p>She took up the cutlass, placed the
point against her breast, and raising her
eyes to heaven, murmured:</p>

<p>"After all, this will give me safety!"</p>

<p>She at once fastened the door of her
chamber, and before retiring to her bed,
where no sleep would visit her, she bound
about her loins a girdle bristling with
small points of iron, and fell in prayer at
the foot of a crucifix, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, God! has not my penance been
severe enough, and must I die dishonored?

<!-- page 33 col 1 -->

Aid me, save me from a crime to
which I am tempted&mdash;to save myself from
blushing at a fault!"</p>

<p>After these words, which, in her despair,
she had uttered aloud, she bowed
her head before the crucifix, and continued
to pray with sobs and tears.</p>

<p>As the singular character of this woman,
in which devotion was thus blended
with cruelty, will be developed in the
course of this narrative, we will omit
analyzing it completely; we will merely
observe to our readers that, of all the
words which they have heard her utter,
a single sentence will, perhaps, best explain
it. "Must I die dishonored?"
This came entirely from her pride. In
her eyes her fault was serious, but only
as it led to disgrace, and it is evident
that to escape from shame she would not
have hesitated at a crime of a deeper
dye. But Don Jos&eacute; did not second her,
Jos&eacute; was not the accomplice for this woman
of violent passions, and neither by
the death of her husband, nor her own,
could she obtain that which she called
her safety. The reader will now permit
us to leap at once over time and
space, and lead him to the summit of a
lofty mountain where he will learn some
results of the occurrences which had taken
place in the castle of the Baron de
la Roque.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE UNSEEN ASSASSIN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was rising, and illuminated
the mountain top with a reddish gleam.
The mists of night, condensed upon the
blades of grass, shrouded its slope in a
garb of greyish white, which was checkered
by the red, blue and violet tints of
the thousand drops as they fell from the
loftiest trees. The crest of the mountain,
covered with a dense forest of firs, whose
gloomy foliage was deluged with dew,
shone with all the colors of the opal.
The declivity of the mountain, from its
fir-crowned summit to its very base,
where a wood of oaks and birch trees
crept insensibly upon the plain, offered
the aspect of an immense prairie, intersected

<!-- page 33 col 2 -->

by ravines, and varied by a few
isolated groups of trees. Here and there
were visible the vestiges of some clay
cottages which had been deserted, and
had been in part destroyed by the tempest.
Deep silence reigned around, broken
only by the murmuring of a brook,
which fell tumbling into the sinuosities
of a ravine; not a voice was heard, not
a cry of beast, whether wild or tame, not
a note of bird. The stillness was so
solemn that it would have inspired the
heart of the most careless with gloom
and awe.</p>

<p>Still the place was not entirely deserted,
for at the most elevated spot of
this immense pasturage a man stood
leaning against a fir tree, with his chin
supported in his hands, which held a
staff, the extremity of which was planted
in the earth. At the feet of this man,
lay an enormous dog, of that brave and
faithful race, which the Pyrenees alone
produce. He gazed at the scene which
was displayed at his feet, and his glance
overlooking the forest of oaks, watched
sadly the circling columns of smoke,
which rose from a village, the roofs of
which, covered with bright tiles, shone
blue and violet amid the foliage of the
surrounding trees, like vast beetles gleaming
in the grass.</p>

<p>This man had stood thus in silent contemplation
for more than half an hour,
while not the slightest movement betrayed
the current of his thoughts, when
the dog which lay at his feet began to
prick up his ears, and to assume a watchful
attitude. The man, admonished by
this slight movement, slowly left his
place, and advanced about a hundred
paces out upon the meadow; when here,
he turned and gazed at the wood, and
with a care which proved his confidence
in the instinct of his companion. The dog
had followed his master, and when the latter
stopped, instead of crouching at his:
feet, he kept a step in advance, with his
restless eye directed toward the wood.</p>

<p>Pastourel (for it was he) loosed his
cutlass from the sheath that hung at his
girdle, and with a tranquil air awaited
the danger which seemed approaching.
He turned his glance upon his dog, and
said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Who is it, Fidele?"</p>

<!-- page 34 col 1 -->

<p>The dog commenced barking, though
not furiously, neither did his hair bristle
as if at the approach of a wild beast,
and in a moment a shrill and melodious
whistle was heard.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is Jean Couteau!" muttered
Pastourel.</p>

<p>He replied by a whistle similar to
that which had attracted his attention,
and returned toward the border of
the wood of fir trees, from which Jean
Couteau soon emerged. These two men
approached one another without any outward
signs of friendship, without any
manifestations of the pleasure which
they felt at meeting with each other.</p>

<p>"Have you eaten?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"No, I was looking for you, to share
with you this morsel of salt goose."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Pastourel, taking
a seat upon the ground, and turning in
front the pouch which was slung across
his back, "in that case, I have done
well to wait for you."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau followed the example of
Pastourel; both thrust their hands into
their knapsacks, and placed between
them the provisions with which they were
supplied. Their store was composed of
brown bread, salt goose, a piece of hard,
dry cheese, and a few nuts. Pastourel
drew at last a wicker-covered bottle from
this pouch, placed it to his lips, swallowed
a portion of its contents, and passed it to
Jean Couteau, who was less temperate,
and who after a long draught, returned
it to Pastourel, crying in a joyous tone,
as if the liquid which he had just tasted
had bewildered him.</p>

<p>"Well, Pastourel! have you seen the
<i>fillou?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen him," replied Pastourel,
in a sad tone, "for I could not
sleep, and I recognised his step at a
quarter of a league from the house. It
was I who opened the door for him, but
he was in such haste to embrace his
father and his sister that he did not speak
a single word to me."</p>

<p>"Then he has not told you how I saved
him," said Jean Couteau, who was now
busily engaged with the viands.</p>

<p>"He has told his father, perhaps," replied
Pastourel, "but I was not present,
and when I expected to return, to speak
with him, my master came and bade me

<!-- page 34 col 2 -->

go at once to the mountain, in order to
see where we could drive the flocks this
year."</p>

<p>"And you see that I was not mistaken
in directing you to this pasturage."</p>

<p>"No, no, the grass is good, but still
the land is contested, and if we should
choose it, quarrels and mishaps might
follow."</p>

<p>"And where the devil would you go?"
said Jean Couteau. "The other pastures
are bare as rocks! Bah! bah! the
Baron de la Roque will have enough to
do to extricate himself from the affair
which he has brought upon his shoulders
last night."</p>

<p>"What affair? The arrest of an honest
councillor and a mountain shepherd
is not a matter to cause the least anxiety
to a man like the baron."</p>

<p>"I do not think so, Pastourel; this
honest councillor has more courage beneath
his gown, than the baron has behind
his walls. I know the Seigneur de
la Roque; he got into too great a passion,
he swore too much, threatened too
much, drank too much, not to show that
he feared this honest councillor, as you
call him, who did not yield an inch to
him, and who treated him as the lieutenant
of the police would treat us, if we
were brought handcuffed before his tribunal."</p>

<p>"So much the better!" rejoined Pastourel,
sadly, "so much the better that
parliament has men who will protect the
poor peasant against the malice of the
noble; but tell me how Galidou demeaned
himself. Was he afraid? was he
recognised? and did Don Jos&eacute; help to
save him?"</p>

<p>"Let me relate the affair as it happened,
and you will see what you are to
think. As to the Comte de Frias, I do
not know with what intention he opened
Galidou's prison, but the <i>fillou</i> is saved,
and that is the main point."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is the main point for
him as well as for me," replied Pastourel,
"but I must know to whom I
should be grateful, for I committed his
safety to the Comte de Frias likewise,"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" said Jean Couteau, "if I
was quicker than he, it was not his
fault, perhaps."</p>

<!-- page 35 col 1 -->

<p>"Of that I will judge. Tell me now
all that happened."</p>

<p>We will leave Jean Couteau to recount
in his own way the scene which
we have described to our readers, and
will take up his narrative at the moment
when he closed the gate of the kennel,
after having left Galidou in the loft.</p>

<p>"I knew well enough," he continued,
"that the <i>fillou</i> put no great trust in me;
you have never told him, I suppose, that
I owe my life to you? Never speak of
it; he would boast of it through all the
country, and we could never contrive
any thing together."</p>

<p>"I have never spoken of it; he looks
upon you as one of the baron's most
faithful servants."</p>

<p>"And I am so," rejoined Jean Couteau,
"ready to do any thing he commands
me, provided it is naught against you, or
against the <i>fillou</i>, since you love him as
if he were your own son. But as for his
father, as to old Gali, who is as wicked
as the baron, and who, unable to do mischief
openly, does it in secret, I would
cut his throat as quietly as I did the
calf's I put in Galidou's place last night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is a droll affair," said Jean
Couteau. "Imagine&mdash;I had not reached
the opposite side of the court, when I
heard the mad-brained Galidou shaking
the bars of the window, so as to be heard
throughout the castle, if the barking of
the dogs had not drowned the noise. So
I thought that if I left him to manage in
his own way, his escape would easily be
known in the morning. For, long before
the castle was opened, long before the
baron had given out the keys, some good
soul would have been found to warn the
Seigneur de la Roque of his flight. Now,
it was a mere trifle to get the <i>fillou</i> out
of the kennel; the most important and
difficult part was to get him out of the
castle.</p>

<p>"With this thought I returned to the
window, and to keep Galidou quiet, I
whispered to him that he would have a
bullet through his head if he continued
to rattle at the bars of his prison.</p>

<p>"I had already determined upon my
plan. I left the great court, and stole
softly toward the stables. The cowherd
was asleep, and, as usual, drunk as a

<!-- page 35 col 2 -->

swine. I untied a fine young calf and
led it gently after me. after having tied
its muzzle with a cord, for fear of its
bleating, and as this silenced it, I took it
upon my shoulders and carried it to the.
kennel. Fortunately, the dogs, excited
by the presence of Galidou, had kept up
a horrible din, so that their howling
drowned all the noise that I made. I
opened the door of the kennel, and told
Galidou to take off the greater part of
his clothes, and to throw them down to
me.</p>

<p>"He refused at first, not knowing what
I could want of them; but as I contrived
to make him understand that I
could have no interest in coming there
in the night, unless it was to save him,
he at last consented. So I thrust the
legs of the calf into his breeches, wrapped
every thing around it that he sent
down to me, and when it was nicely
dressed, I dragged it to the door of the
kennel, drove my cutlass into its throat,
that the blood might excite the dogs to
the chase, and tossed it into the midst of
the pack. Then there was a din, as if a
thousand devils were let loose. Such a
snapping, and throttling, and howling&mdash;<i>ma foi</i>,
it was enough to tumble the old
castle about our ears! The old wolf
started up in his cage, and for want of
meat, began to bite and tear the iron
bars. I hastened to bring Galidou down,
fastened the gate of the kennel, and led the
<i>fillou</i>, trembling like a leaf, to my hay loft.
When there, I explained to him that when
the day broke, they would come to look
after him, and on seeing his garments in
shreds, and bones scattered about the
kennel, they would think that it was he
who had been devoured.</p>

<p>"There are strange things in this
world, Pastourel," said Jean Couteau,
suddenly interrupting the thread of his
narrative; "the <i>fillou</i> has courage, although
he is a braggart, and I am very
sure that if they had placed him face to
face with the old wolf, he would have
bravely throttled him; well, when I said
to him laughing, 'it is you that the dogs
are now eating!' a cold sweat broke out
upon him, and he almost swooned away."</p>

<p>"That is easily understood," said
Pastourel, in a grave and melancholy
tone, "people with vivid imaginations

<!-- page 36 col 1 -->

seem oftentimes to be alarmed at the
thought of danger, for they involuntarily
picture it so terrible, that it would frighten
those who are most courageous."</p>

<p>"Danger is what it is," replied Jean
Couteau, "it never goes farther than
death, whether one is torn by dogs, embowelled
by a bear, or killed by a musket
ball. Consequently, I do not see
how the imagination can add to it."</p>

<p>"How!" said Pastourel, "you do not
see that you would rather be killed outright
with a bullet, than to be torn, for
example, piece-meal, by dogs?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances,"
replied Jean Couteau; "in the first case,
a man dies like a beast, while in the
other, he has time to say his prayers,
and repeat his <i>mea culpa</i>. And do you
see, Pastourel, when a man is a good
catholic, he ought not to wish to die before
he has set all in order."</p>

<p>"You are right," rejoined Pastourel,
gloomily, as he turned aside his head, and
gazed at the morsel which he was about
to eat: "and did the trick succeed?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>," said Jean Couteau, "at
one time I was near paying for the baron's
calf. I was upon the watch, when
I heard the door of the kennel opened;
it was Don Jos&eacute;. I knew him by the
terrible cries which he uttered when he
missed Galidou and beheld the dogs despatching
the carcase. He at once gave
the alarm, ran to fetch the baron, and
with that the whole castle was in an
uproar.</p>

<p>" 'The devil!' I said to Galidou, 'things
are going ill; if they find but a single
shred of the calf's hide, they will never
take it for the skin of a Christian, and
we shall both be discovered,' Fortunately,
however, the dogs had done their
work bravely; and besides, Don Jos&eacute; had
left the gate of the kennel open, so that
the hounds had escaped, each carrying
his morsel with him. I took good care
not to go down and put an end to the
feast; I laughed to see the dogs scatter
my calf around so greedily. At last I
heard the baron's voice; it was necessary
to obey, and I soon got the hounds
back into the kennel; but the trick had
succeeded. The baron was pale as a
corpse, his hair stood on end like thorns;
he told me to collect the remains of the

<!-- page 36 col 2 -->

unhappy Galidou, and to place them in a
chest. I did this with such haste and
horror that no one had the least suspicion
of the truth.</p>

<p>"I never saw the baron in such a state;
it was the first time in his life, perhaps
that he trembled. That was all well,
for it prevented him from distinguishing
between a man's leg and a leg of veal.</p>

<p>"But how were you able to leave the
castle in the night?" said Pastourel,
whose heart stirred at this bloody narrative.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is a different matter, Pastourel!"
replied Jean Couteau. "I think
that the baron was softened, for he directed
me to go to the Abbey of St. Barthelmi,
and to bring Father Anselmo,
that he might inter the remains of the
unfortunate Galidou."</p>

<p>"How say you?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" rejoined Jean Couteau,
laughing boisterously, "they are
going to bury my calf with mass and
holy water. I am very glad I am not
there; I should burst with laughter!
'The poor Galidou! the comely youth!'
they will say, with a pitiful air, 'to die
thus!&mdash;how he must have suffered!'
And Father Anselmo chanting <i>De profundis</i>
over my calf&mdash;<i>requiescat in pace</i> over
my calf! Ha! that is a famous joke! is
it not, Pastourel?"</p>

<p>And Couteau laughed till the mountain
echoed again.</p>

<p>"It is sacrilege, perhaps," said the
shepherd, in a tone of irony.</p>

<p>These words at once checked Jean
Couteau's hilarity, and he replied:</p>

<p>"It was not I who directed him to be
buried. I put a calf in a man's place to
be devoured; it is not my fault if&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and added after a moment's
silence:</p>

<p>"If I had thought of that, I would
have told Father Anselmo; but now it
must be all over. Well, I will confess
it."</p>

<p>Pastourel, who had thus far listened
to Jean Couteau with an air of anxious
interest, smiled disdainfully, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you will do well to do so,
although it was the consequence of performing
a good action. But tell me how,
you got Galidou out of the castle."</p>

<p>"The baron had gone to his chamber

<!-- page 37 col 1 -->

to fetch the keys, and I feared lest he
would return himself to open the gate.
I was in great trouble, therefore, when
another droll idea came into my mind&mdash;no,
no," continued Jean Couteau, shaking
his head&mdash;"I was wrong again; I did a
sinful thing, and Galidou, whom I thought
a coward, had more sense than I, for he
was afraid when I told him to wrap himself
up in a large white sheet, and play
the part of his soul."</p>

<p>Again Pastourel regarded his companion
with a scornful air, and the latter
resumed, but no longer in the merry
tone in which he had commenced his
narrative:</p>

<p>"Yes, I had wrapped him in a large
white sheet, and placed him erect near
the portcullis. When the baron appeared,
he was to say, in a hollow voice, like
a dead man: 'Baron, open thy castle
gate; thou mayest keep my body, but
thou shalt not have my soul!' "</p>

<p>Pastourel could not repress a smile,
and said:</p>

<p>"And was the baron terrified at this
apparition?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately," replied Jean Couteau,
"we were not obliged to resort to it. I
heard him talking in the court with Don
Jos&eacute;, who demanded like a madman permission
to leave the castle; the baron
would not consent, and while he was directing
two men to hold him, I stepped up
and asked him for the keys, he gave them
to me, and away we went. When we
reached the ford of the torrent, I left the
<i>fillou</i> to make his way home alone, and
went to the abbey where I found Father
Anselmo, and said to him&mdash;what was it I
said to him&mdash;that the baron wanted him&mdash;that
was all. I did not tell him for what;
if they are committing sacrilege, it is not
my fault."</p>

<p>"And how did you know that you
would find me here?"</p>

<p>"Galidou told me that you were going
to look for pasture this morning, and I
wanted to see you to consult with you,
for the baron will of course find out that
Galidou is not dead, and if the <i>fillou</i>, who
is a babbler, amuses himself by relating
the manner in which I got him out of his
danger, it is very likely that I may have
to take his place, and I should find no
one to render me the service which I

<!-- page 37 col 2 -->

rendered him. At this present moment,
indeed, I believe the baron bitterly repents
the misfortune which he thinks has
happened, but I am equally sure that he
will be furious, when he discovers that
he has been deceived, for the cowherd
will not find his calf, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, Jean," said Pastourel, "no
harm will happen to you for what you
have done to-day, I promise you. Some
one, perhaps, will suffer for it, but it will
not be you."</p>

<p>"Who then will suffer for me?"</p>

<p>"Jean," replied Pastourel, with an air
of melancholy, "they have given me the
reputation of a sorcerer in this district,
and God is my witness that I have never
practised any spell for which I should
fear to appear before his bar, yet&mdash;I will
not deny it&mdash;I have often been warned
by some power&mdash;I know not what&mdash;of
that which is about to happen to me."</p>

<p>"Pastourel," said Jean Couteau, with
reserve and gravity, "I owe my life to
you, and you must confess that I am not
forgetful of benefits, but you know also
that I have never wished to meddle with
your dealings with the devil."</p>

<p>"You are silly," replied Pastourel,
calmly. "I have told you that I have
never had recourse to magic. But look
down upon this meadow; at thirty paces
from that fir-tree,&mdash;there where a white
stone peers out above the grass&mdash;well,
there, for more than an hour this morning,
I have seen myself stretched out,
with my arms crossed, and my head
crushed by a bullet above the left temple.
I was dead:"</p>

<p>"What a fancy!" cried Jean Couteau,
turning pale.</p>

<p>"It was not a fancy," replied Pastourel,
"I saw myself as I see you, and it
will happen, you may be sure of it."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Jean, who, although
more agitated than the shepherd,
still endeavored to encourage him, "you
were sleeping standing, and you have
been dreaming of blood and death since
last evening."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Pastourel, "my
staff will be near me, my pouch will be
under my head. Return to-morrow, and
you will see."</p>

<p>"I will not return to-morrow," said
Jean Couteau, who could with difficulty

<!-- page 38 col 1 -->

conceal his terror, "for I will not leave
you."</p>

<p>"You will leave me," rejoined Pastourel,
mildly, "you will leave me&mdash;it
is necessary&mdash;something will separate us,
you will see."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau broke out into loud
laughter, which was suddenly checked,
however, as he observed the sad glance
with which Pastourel surveyed him.
Still he made another effort to subdue
his superstitious terror, in order to combat
that which seemed mastering Pastourel,
and he said:</p>

<p>"And who the devil do you think
would send a bullet through your head?
For a bullet does not come of itself, and
no one of the inhabitants of la Roque, no,
not all of them in a body would dare to
venture so high up the mountain, and
that is the reason that I directed you to
this pasturage."</p>

<p>"Who will send a bullet through my
head, say you?" answered Pastourel,
"I could tell you, for I have seen his
face, he came out of the wood yonder,
and he looked to see if I did not stir, and
then he disappeared."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau listened to the shepherd
with heaving bosom and fixed eyes, as if
each instant he expected to behold some
supernatural being rise before him.</p>

<p>"You have seen him to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was he."</p>

<p>"But why not rid yourself of him
then?"</p>

<p>"It is necessary that he should live
and I die!"</p>

<p>"Pastourel, kneel down and pray to
God, if you have no dealings with Satan.
Our Lord will deliver you from these
wicked thoughts; for all this is but a
vision."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Jean, it is a vision, for I
saw what I tell you, and it will happen
because it is to be. You men who live
in perpetual action, you know not as
well as I do, how many things can be
seen before they happen. This morning,
on this spot, I saw a fawn pass by, and
then an eagle; the fawn entered the
wood, and the eagle perched upon an
oak. Wait a moment, and you will see
it bearing the fawn to its eyrie. Stay!
stay! hearest thou? there was a cry!
look up, the eagle must be passing."</p>

<!-- page 38 col 2 -->

<p>While Pastourel spoke he kept his
eyes fixed upon the earth, but his accent
was that of a man who sees the objects
of which he speaks. Jean directed his
eyes mechanically toward the heavens,
and beheld indeed an eagle darting
swiftly onward, bearing a fawn in his talons.
The impression which this sight
produced upon the bear hunter was so
powerful that he started up from the
ground, and retreated a few paces.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" said Pastourel, mildly,
"does that surprise you? The eagle
needed this fawn to feed its young; it
has pursued and taken it, and it was
meant to be so. And thus, Jean, there
lives one who needs my blood, that her
child may enjoy a wide, free range, and
she will compass my death."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Jean Couteau, "you
are mad, and you mock me; you saw
the eagle fly from the wood, and you pretended
to be looking upon the ground."</p>

<p>"I have no need to raise my eyes to
see," said Pastourel, "for I feel who it
is that comes, and he will soon be here."</p>

<p>"Who is it then?" exclaimed Jean,
with strange terror, and he turned to discover
this enemy.</p>

<p>"After all, there is no reason why I
should not tell you," replied Pastourel,
"for all the country will know it, and
you will be able neither to save or avenge
me. Yes, yes, I must tell you, and
you will learn my secret, and that of the
murderer. But still, Jean, let them
never know that you are informed of it,
for in one way or another they will try
to get rid of you. Jean! Jean! there is
some one,&mdash;I see him now&mdash;who has
proposed to you to slay me!"</p>

<p>Jean Couteau, pale and trembling, replied
in a gloomy tone:</p>

<p>"Yes, the Baron de la Roque has promised
me two hundred livres if I killed
you, and four hundred if I brought you
alive into his presence."</p>

<p>"There is another," rejoined Pastourel,
with his eyes fixed before him, like
one who looks through a loophole into an
enclosure, and explains what is passing
there to another who cannot see it, "there
is another who has proposed to you to
slay me, and that within the last twelve
hours."</p>

<p>"It is true," replied Jean Couteau,

<!-- page 39 col 1 -->

whose knees shook beneath him, "it was
Don Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Don Jos&eacute;, it is he indeed,
and as you have not done it, he will do
it himself."</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;!" exclaimed Jean, "no,
no, it is impossible!"</p>

<p>"You will see, you will see, Jean! I
am in possession of his secret. I know
that the baroness&mdash;stay, he is coming;
he is afraid lest I should speak to you,
but I do not fear him. I will speak.
Listen!"</p>

<p>"One day," said Pastourel to Jean
Couteau, "one day, about five years
since, I was on the edge of the precipice
of St. Barthelmi. I saw a young man
of eighteen years, who seemed to be seeking
for some one. He knew that it was I,
and I made a sign to him.  'You are
Pastourel, the sorcerer,' he said to me.
Alas! Jean, the wicked thought entered
my head to take advantage of my evil
name, trusting to my innocence, which
told me that I did not merit it; for in
truth, it does not depend upon me to see
or not to see that which appears to me.
I divined by the visage of this young
man that he was in love, and I said to
him:</p>

<p>" 'Yes, I am Pastourel, whom you
seek that he may furnish you with the
means to succeed in your love.'</p>

<p>"The young man was troubled at
these words, as if I had told him something
wonderful. And still, what could
bring a comely youth of eighteen years,
to an old shepherd whom he esteemed a
sorcerer, unless to speak of his love?
Then he told me that he was enamored
of the daughter of the Seigneur de Labastide,
the beautiful Paula, and that she
was about to be married to the Baron de
la Roque.</p>

<p>"Jean! Jean! there is as much wickedness
in an evil counsel, as in an evil
action. I hated the baron, who had already
begun his persecutions against us
shepherds, and I foolishly said to the
young man:</p>

<p>" 'When you were a child, and you
feared lest you should be deprived of a
fruit which you longed for, you carried
it off, did you not?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, indeed!' he said. 'If Paula
would have consented, I should not now
be here to consult you. I should long

<!-- page 39 col 2 -->

since have carried her away from Labastide.'</p>

<p>" 'She who says <i>nay</i> by the light of
day, oftentimes says <i>yea</i> in the night.' "</p>

<p>"It was not as a sorcerer that you
said that," interrupted Jean.</p>

<p>"No, in truth," continued Pastourel,
"but it was evil counsel, and he followed
it. Fifteen days afterward he came to
me in despair, saying: 'You have rendered
me guilty, and have not rendered
me happy. To-morrow she weds the
baron, for she cannot refuse him without
owning the truth, and that would be her
death. Counsel me how I may prevent
this marriage.'</p>

<p>"Hatred is blind, and I counselled
him to remain near the baron's person,
and wait until some chance should sever
the union, since neither he nor she could
prevent it. 'The day will come,' I said
to myself, 'when blood will flow in the
castle of our persecutors, and some one
will fall a victim.' But the evil will return
upon him who purposed it. I shall
be the victim!"</p>

<p>At these words Pastourel seemed to
gaze more steadfastly before him; he
bent his head, as if listening to a distant
sound.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he cried, gloomily, "he
comes! Do you hear him?"</p>

<p>Pastourel, who until now had remained
seated upon the ground, suddenly
rose, while his dog started up with flashing
eyes, bristling hair, and uttering a
howl of terror.</p>

<p>"It is he! it is he!" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>Jean, greatly terrified, looked toward
the edge of the wood, and beheld an enormous
bear coming toward them. He
supposed that Pastourel, more familiar
than himself with the silence of the
mountain, had heard the approach of the
animal, and influenced by his fancy, had
taken it for that of a man.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he cried, "if that is the
fellow who is to bring you death, I will
answer for your life." And he advanced
courageously toward the bear.</p>

<p>Pastourel, at the sight of the danger
to which Jean Couteau was exposing
himself, seemed to forget all his presentiments;
he urged on his dog against the
ferocious animal, and ran himself toward
the border of the wood. Jean was
now within a few paces of the beast, and

<!-- page 40 col 1 -->

the dog was circling around him, uttering
short, angry growls. Pastourel hastened
to come up with them, and scarcely
had he reached the white stone, which
he had pointed out, exclaiming, "let us
both at it!&mdash;it is a she bear, and we will
find its cubs!" when suddenly the sharp
report of a musket was heard. Jean
turned his head, and beheld Pastourel
extended upon the earth, his arms crossed,
his staff near him, and his pouch beneath
his bleeding head.</p>

<p>At this sight, the superstitious terror
which Pastourel's words had excited in
his bosom, awoke more powerful than
ever in the soul of Jean Couteau; he
stood for some moments stupefied, incapable
of motion, with his eyes fixed upon
the body, which he beheld lying in the
attitude which Pastourel had described
to him.</p>

<p>His feet seemed rooted to the earth;
he fancied himself under the control of
that infernal power which had just
snatched away his companion; and this
emotion would have lasted still longer,
perhaps, if the shepherd's dog had not
suddenly rushed between Jean Couteau
and the body of his master.</p>

<p>At this sight, the hunter started backward,
and the dog, after having scented
his master, darted furiously upon Jean,
and before the latter could place himself
in an attitude of defence, he had bitten him
twice or thrice severely. Jean at last
drew the long <i>couteau de chasse</i>, which
had given him the name by which he
was generally known, and with a single
blow laid the dog dead at his master's
side.</p>

<p>The necessity of self-defence, had, as
it were, dissolved the charm which had
rendered the hunter motionless, but it
had not effaced the terror with which
this sudden and predicted death had inspired
him. Scarcely had the dog fallen,
when the unhappy Jean took to flight,
looking neither to the right hand nor to
the left, but hurrying onward with that
instinct which survives all consciousness,
chased by a terror more fearful
than the pursuit of the most dangerous
enemy.</p>

<p>The fatigue, however, of so long and
rapid a race, obliged him at last to pause.
The distance at which he now found
himself from the scene of that strange

<!-- page 40 col 2 -->

event, the sight of a human habitation, for
he was already near the castle, permitted
him to collect his thoughts for a moment;
but the mind of Jean Couteau
had not sufficient strength to reason upon
what had passed, and he was unable to
escape from the following dilemma;
either Pastourel had felt the approach of
his murderer, and it was Don Jos&eacute; who
had slain him, and therefore he was undoubtedly
a real sorcerer, or he had been
deceived, and then it was the devil who
had carried him away.</p>

<p>In either case, the hunter remembered
that Father Anselmo was at the castle,
and he resolved to seek him out at once,
to confess all to him, and to place himself
under the protection of his prayers,
should it cost him the savings of ten
years' labor.</p>

<p>It was in this state of mind that Jean,
with disordered garments, his face still
wearing traces of the deepest alarm,
reached the gate of the castle. But before
narrating what occurred on his arrival,
it is necessary to recount the events
which had preceded it.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE DUNGEON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left the baron at the moment,
when, convinced that Galidou had been
devoured by his dogs, he had sent for a
priest to inter his supposed remains. We
have seen, from the recital of Jean Couteau,
how the baron had opposed the
departure of Don Jos&eacute; de Frias. The
old seigneur returned to his apartment
after having given the keys of the portcullis
to his messenger, forgetting, for
the first time in his life, perhaps, to lock
up the castle with his own hands.</p>

<p>The baroness had remained alone
in her chamber; she had long since
formed a correct estimate of Don Jos&eacute;'s
character. Brave with the bravery
common to all men, skilful in the use of
arms, loving with that love which is
ready to sacrifice a fortune to its object,
he was liable to none of those excesses
of temerity and of passion, which take
by surprise the hearts of women; he
was destitute of that firmness and resolution

<!-- page 41 col 1 -->

which sways them and commands
their respect.</p>

<p>The feelings which Paula felt toward
Don Jos&eacute; were strangely inconsistent;
she alternately despised him and loved
him, blessed him and cursed him. This
man, neither good nor bad, whom she
was unable to inspire with a resolution
against herself or her husband, caused
her to tremble with impatience and with
rage. Again and again, in her hours of
despair, she had said to him, "Leave me!
do not heed my tears! leave me, and kill
me, or kill him, and remain! I cannot
live thus!" And Jos&eacute; waited calmly for
these hours of madness to pass, promising
her no hope, no relief from her tortures.
Then she despised him, but when
her rage was wearied out by the dull
irresolution of her lover, she thanked
him upon her knees for having turned
a deaf ear to her cries, her tears, her
imprecations.</p>

<p>But never, perhaps, had the baroness
felt such anger, such contempt for Don
Jos&eacute; as that which disturbed her bosom
when he informed her that Pastourel was
in possession of their secret. He had
left her, saying, that he would kill the
shepherd; but the baroness did not credit
him. "No," she exclaimed, "he has
endured this fear, this slavery for five
years; he has submitted to the thought
that another could dispose of his life and
of mine. He is the basest of cowards;
if I do not save myself, I am lost, forever
lost!"</p>

<p>A woman, with a character like that
of the baroness, and with the ideas of
the present day, would not have been long
in forming her resolution. Suicide would
have occurred to her as an easy resource;
but the guiltiest sinner when she believes
in a merciful God, who elevates repentance
to a level with virtue, dares not
commit a crime which robs her of her
last hope, and insures her eternal condemnation.
Paula did not think of self-destruction;
not that she feared death,
but death by her own hands. Still, she
saw no means to avoid the danger which
threatened her; she acted like a prisoner
who, confined in a gloomy dungeon, is
certain to perish unless he finds some
way of escape; he searches in every direction,
groping along the walls and

<!-- page 41 col 2 -->

ground for an avenue of flight; and
when all hope is exhausted, when despair
has taken possession of his soul, if
a stone trembles beneath his hand, if a
faint light reaches his eye, he rushes
thitherward without reflection, without
prudence, without inquiring whether he
may not increase his peril in seeking to
avoid it.</p>

<p>It was thus with Paula; after having
sought long, and in vain to find some
way of refuge, without discovering a ray
to guide her through the darkness which
enveloped her, she grasped at the first
hope which dawned upon her. She left
her chamber, and after having traversed
several gloomy passages, she reached the
threshold of the prison in which Barati
was confined with the scribe Langlois.
She directed the guard to open it, and
having entered, she carefully closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p>The councillor and Langlois, who had
been for several hours plunged in the
deepest obscurity, were so dazzled at the
sudden gleam of the light which Paula
held in her hand, that at first they did not
recognise her. Langlois, who was lying
in a corner upon a heap of dirty straw,
turned quickly, fell upon his knees, and
began to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>The councillor, who was seated upon
a wretched joint stool, which he had
found by groping about his dungeon,
raised his head without leaving his place,
and said:</p>

<p>"Does the baron purpose to keep us
here long?"</p>

<p>"I do not know the intention of the
baron," replied the baroness; "but I
can tell you mine."</p>

<p>At this voice Barati rose and saluted
the baroness with a courtliness which the
most gallant noble might have envied in
this obscure representative of the <i>noblesse</i>
of the robe, and replied:</p>

<p>"The intentions, madam, which have
led you at this hour to this infected den,
cannot be otherwise than benevolent."</p>

<p>"Whatever they may be, sir," rejoined
Paula, "I can impart them to
you alone."</p>

<p>"Madam, this officer of the parliament
has been associated with me, to note down
all that I may hear as a magistrate,
and&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 42 col 1 -->

<p>"Sir councillor," resumed the baroness,
"I have that to say to you which is
entirely foreign to the errand upon which
you have been sent. Besides, I have
come to ask advice of you rather than to
render you a service; but in either case
it is necessary that we should be alone."</p>

<p>"Leave us, master Langlois," said the
councillor.</p>

<p>The latter, who a moment before could
have paid any price for the liberty of
leaving this damp dungeon, replied in a
churlish tone:</p>

<p>"It is my duty to remain near you,
worthy councillor. I have not failed to
do so when the danger was imminent,
and it would be scarcely just to banish
me when a chance of safety is offered."</p>

<p>"Your first duty is to obey me."</p>

<p>"And where do you wish me to go?"
said Langlois.</p>

<p>The baroness opened the door, and
said to the guard:</p>

<p>"I place this man in your keeping;
do not let him stir from this door until I
have left the prison."</p>

<p>Langlois, wavering between the fear
of throwing an obstacle in the way of an
arrangement which might free him from
the baron's clutches, and the suspicion
that the councillor might be liberated
alone by means of some secret gate in
the prison, hesitated.</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," he said at last,
"I obey; but it is your duty to provide
for my protection as it is mine to render
you obedience."</p>

<p>"Go, sir, go!" said Barati, "I know
my duties; try to remember yours."</p>

<p>Langlois left the prison, and the baroness
remained with Barati.</p>

<p>"Well, madam?" said the councillor.</p>

<p>A deep sigh swelled the bosom of the
baroness, and as if she feared to exhaust
her courage by preliminary explanations,
she said quickly:</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati, you can save me."</p>

<p>"Save you, madam?"</p>

<p>"The law, the parliament, you, some
one has the power to free me from the
life to which I am here condemned&mdash;from
a life passed amid bloodshed and violence!
You have seen the Baron de la
Roque; listen now to what has just occurred
in the castle."</p>

<p>Then, in a few words, and with an

<!-- page 42 col 2 -->

energy inspired by the horror which she
felt, and by the wish to interest Barati
in her behalf, she related the unhappy
fate of Galidou, and then added:</p>

<p>"Must I live here a helpless witness
of such atrocities until the day arrives
when I in my turn shall become the victim?"</p>

<p>Barati was far from expecting such an
appeal on the part of the baroness. Every
feeling of humanity and generosity
prompted him to engage in the defence
of an unhappy woman who was exposed
to incessant danger; but conscious of his
inability to aid her in his capacity of a
magistrate, he said:</p>

<p>"The law, madam, and consequently
parliament cannot assist you, except you
have personal grievances to complain of
against the Baron de la Roque. And as
to myself, I am not now in a position to
render my services effectual.</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," replied Paula,
"I can open the gates of this castle, and
thus perhaps save your life, but then I
must leave it with you; you must bear
me away as you would a prisoner whom
you found in a haunt of brigands, into
whose hands you had fallen."</p>

<p>"Your position is terrible, madam,"
said Barati, "and every honest heart
must sigh over it; but the law offers no
means to liberate you."</p>

<p>"So, then," said the baroness, "you,
a magistrate, may foresee a crime, and
yet you cannot prevent it when every
thing combines to convince you that it is
meditated."</p>

<p>Barati reflected; he was forcibly impressed
with the thought, that, with a
man of the baron's character, a moment
of intoxication or of anger might impel
him to the crime of murder, and after a
moment's silence, he replied:</p>

<p>"Madam, that which has passed this
night may bring about results which
may protect you far better than I can,
but it is necessary to await them."</p>

<p>"Await them! here, doubtless?" said
Paula, in a bitter tone, and with an air
of keen vexation. "Oh, sir, when I
beheld the courage with which you
braved the baron's fury, I expected to
find in you a man, who would not hesitate
to liberate a woman from a condition
so desperate as mine."</p>

<!-- page 43 col 1 -->

<p>"Madam," replied Barati sternly, "a
man is always courageous in the fulfilment
of his duty. Permit the officer of
parliament who has just left us, to re-enter
this dungeon, in which I am a
prisoner, and I will, in his presence, receive
the complaint which you would address
to me against the Baron de la Roque,
and if I think that you are exposed to
danger by a longer residence in this castle,
I will summon him to set you at liberty,
that you may retire into a convent, there
to await the issue of a suit which you
will commence against him. But as to
assisting you in escaping from the abode
of your husband, in this, madam, you
cannot count upon me."</p>

<p>"In truth, sir," said the baroness
with increased asperity, "your aid will
be very efficacious to me, when you
leave me in the power of the Baron de
la Roque, after I have entered a complaint
against him. For do you suppose
he would heed your summons?"</p>

<p>"Madam, the king himself cannot
prevent an assassin from slaying a man
who walks peaceably upon the high road,
but woe to him who should brave his
power, or that of the parliament, when
once admonished that you are under his
protection."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, sir," replied Paula,
tranquilly, "that you yourself are an
example of the respect in which the
baron holds this power."</p>

<p>"Who knows, madam? Night brings
counsel, and the baron already, perhaps,
repents of his conduct towards me,"
said Barati ironically.</p>

<p>"In that case, sir, you will permit
me to wait for this proof of the fear
with which parliament can inspire the
baron, and I will seek in submission and
silence a refuge against the ills with
which I am incessantly menaced."</p>

<p>"As you think best, madam," replied
Barati coldly. "Yet permit me to assure
you that if I had entered this castle under
any other title than that of a magistrate,
you would not in vain have claimed
my aid to assist your flight; but that
which my honor as a gentleman would
then have enjoined upon me, is forbidden
by the office with which I am invested."</p>

<p>The baroness frowned, and glancing

<!-- page 43 col 2 -->

upon Barati with an indignant air, she
replied, proudly:</p>

<p>"It is the protection of the magistrate
alone, which I demand; it does not become
the Baroness de la Roque to accept
any other."</p>

<p>"A word can ensure it to you, madam.
Tell me formally, and for reasons
that you can reveal to me without danger,
that you wish to be liberated from
the authority of your husband, and I
will enforce your demand."</p>

<p>The baroness hesitated, then impelled
by some secret thought, answered
quickly:</p>

<p>"Recall this man, and receive my
complaint."</p>

<p>Langlois was recalled; and the baroness,
without complaining personally
against the Baron de la Roque, declared
that it was impossible for her to live in
a house which was the daily scene of
occurrences similar to those which we
have recounted to our readers. She
mentioned a number, the results of
which, though less frightful in appearance,
were much more melancholy in
reality. Thus, unhappy peasants had
been confined in damp dungeons without
any nourishment but mouldy bread and
water; others had been whipped, others
still more severely injured; in fine, there
was enough to justify the demand of the
baroness in the eyes of any tribunal.
Langlois wrote, while Paula rehearsed
these facts with an agitation which Barati
attributed to her alarm. When she
had ended, the councillor presented the
complaint for her signature, which last
formality she executed with a desperate
effort, then left the prison, saying, as she
went:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I am under your safeguard,
and that which you have witnessed
in this castle should insure me
your protection, whatever may be the
pretexts which the Baron de la Roque
may invent to punish me."</p>

<p>Her last words surprised Barati; it was
true, the baroness had reason to believe
that her husband might resolve to punish
her for the complaint which she had
entered against him, but this complaint
could not be called a pretext, and the
truth, although still indistinct, rose for a
moment before the mind of the councillor.

<!-- page 44 col 1 -->

Langlois interrupted his reflections.</p>

<p>"This is a precious piece of evidence
against the baron," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," rejoined Barati, "perhaps
this evidence alone will not suffice
to convict him, but the crime which has
been committed here this night cannot
be punished too severely."</p>

<p>"Is it true," replied Langlois, turning
pale&mdash;"the story which the guard
has just told me? that that young man
has been devoured by the baron's dogs."</p>

<p>"Madam de la Roque has related it
to me also, and the tumult which we
heard confirms it."</p>

<p>"Lord of heaven!" said Langlois, trembling
in every limb, "if the like should
happen to us! for the baron is like a
mad wolf to-night. The guard told me
that he had arrested the young page who
met us at the torrent, and had thrown
him into prison, because he insisted upon
leaving the castle."</p>

<p>"He feared doubtless lest he might
inform against him," said Barati, who
considered this arrest as confirming the
suspicion which he had conceived; he
then, added: "Langlois, did you notice
the shepherd who was waiting for us at
the passage of the Tunnel, and the tone
in which he recommended the safety of
his master's son to Don Jos&eacute; de Frias?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," said the latter, "one
would have thought that the peasant had
a right to command the comte."</p>

<p>Barati reflected for a while, and then
said:</p>

<p>"Well, master Langlois, whatever
may happen, do not speak of the complaint
we have just received, until we
have left the castle."</p>

<p>"Never fear," replied Langlois,
quickly, "for if the baron knew we
were in possession of the deposition, and
that I was acquainted with its contents,
he would make us pass between the
jaws of his dogs, rather than suffer it to
reach parliament."</p>

<p>"Be silent then upon the subject
until I think best to speak of it," said
Barati.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to relate in this
place the various reasons which confirmed
the councillor in the belief that
the complaint of the baroness was a precaution

<!-- page 44 col 2 -->

which she took against the
future, rather than a reparation which
she demanded for the past.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night passed
away in quietness.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">REPARATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was after day-break when the guard
opened the door of the prison in which
Barati and Langlois were confined.</p>

<p>They were conducted in to the same
hall in which they had been received on
the preceding evening. The same arrangements
had been made; the baroness
was present, and a priest was seated
near her.</p>

<p>When Barati entered, the baron rose,
and said:</p>

<p>"A chair for the councillor Barati."</p>

<p>An arm-chair was at once brought for
him.</p>

<p>"Take your place, sir," said the
baron to Langlois, "and write what you
are about to hear, as is your duty."</p>

<p>Barati signed to Langlois to obey, and
he was upon the point of taking up the
word himself, when the Baron de la
Roque prevented him by a gesture replete
with dignity. The aspect of the
old seigneur was completely changed;
his eyes had lost their fire, and the savage
smile which gave so cruel an expression
to his face had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Listen, sir," he said, "listen, and
you, sir, write down my words."</p>

<p>He then added, like a man who has
carefully reflected upon the meaning and
the expression of what he is about to say:</p>

<p>"I, Adrian, Baron de la Roque, uninfluenced
by fear or favour, acknowledge
the following facts:&mdash;"</p>

<p>These facts were but a repetition of
that which had occurred on the preceding
evening, from the time of Barati's arrest
to the supposed death of Galidou. This
recital, delivered with great calmness,
contained not a single expression which
could palliate the baron's misdeeds, and
concluded with the following words:</p>

<p>"I make this voluntary declaration
because it pleases me to do so, and from

<!-- page 45 col 1 -->

my regret at the misfortune which has
occurred, without being impelled by any
fear of the punishment which the parliament
may choose to inflict upon me.
And to convince all that I do not seek to
save myself by any idle subterfuge, I
maintain as right and lawful all that I
have done up to this day, against the
boors who have infringed upon my domain;
I considered it as just, and I in
no wise deny it, and I am ready to prove
that in nothing have I transgressed the
limits of that authority which belongs to
my rank. So well am I convinced of
this, that I am willing, in order that strict
justice may be meted out to all, to suffer
each one who may feel aggrieved to
place their complaints in the hands of the
sieur Barati; making known to all here
present, as has been made known to those
without, that this castle will remain open
during the entire day, and that all and
each shall be at liberty to come and go,
whatever he may have to say, or has already
said against me."</p>

<p>Barati had listened to the baron with
an air of rigid imperturbability, while at
the same time he closely scrutinized
Paula, who had started involuntarily on
hearing that the baron had thrown open
the castle to all complainants from without.
Under these circumstances she
felt convinced that Pastourel, on learning
the fate of Galidou, would appear to
avenge the young man, and to disclose the
secret of her shame. She made a movement
to rise when the baron had ended,
but the sound of Barati's voice checked
her.</p>

<p>"Not only," he said, "can those safely
enter where sits the commissioned authority
of the parliament, but those who
would not speak of their own will are
bound to answer to my queries."</p>

<p>A smile played about the baron's lips,
and he said, turning to Barati:</p>

<p>"You defended the honor of the robe
courageously last evening, and to-day
you would save that of legal forms. It
is well; do as you think fit."</p>

<p>"Among those whose evidence I wish
to obtain, baron," resumed the councillor,
"two men are wanting here, and two
who could, perhaps, give me the surest information&mdash;Don
Jos&eacute; and a man whom
I have heard called Jean Couteau."</p>

<!-- page 45 col 2 -->

<p>"Don Jos&eacute; will be brought before you,
sir; I have detained him prisoner, because
if I had suffered him to leave the
castle, as he wished, it might have been
thought that I feared his disclosures. As
to Jean Couteau, I know not why he has
not yet returned. I sent him, it is true,
to seek the venerable Father Anselmo,
for I wish that an expiatory mass may
be celebrated in this castle, for him who
has been the victim of my rashness; but
he will return, sir, he will return. Let
Don Jos&eacute; be brought in," added the baron.
"In the mean time let those who
wish to speak, come forward; we have
no time to lose."</p>

<p>"True, my lord," said one of the menials
in a voice of terror, "for the peasants
can be seen mounting the castle hill, as
if they were preparing to assault it."</p>

<p>The baroness fell back upon her chair
at the thought that Pastourel might be
among these peasants. At the same
moment Barati said in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Come forward, you who have just
spoken! Has the Baron de la Roque to
your knowledge at any time attacked
the shepherds of the mountain?"</p>

<p>"You can answer," said the baron.</p>

<p>"Sir councillor," said the menial, "I
have nothing to say against my master."</p>

<p>"Nor I! nor I!" repeated almost all
present.</p>

<p>The baroness was evidently agitated
by a fearful struggle. Barati made
another attempt to interrogate some of the
baron's attendants, but he received the
same answer from all, and he resumed:
"Why is not Don Jos&eacute; brought in before
me! For I see no one else from
whom I can require an answer."</p>

<p>A man now appeared at the door of
the hall, and said to the baron:</p>

<p>"My lord, the shepherds refuse to enter
the castle without a safe conduct
written in your own hand."</p>

<p>The baron took a pen, wrote a few
words, and gave the open paper to the
man, saying:</p>

<p>"Let them enter without fear. Whatever
they may say against me, they shall
pass out unhindered."</p>

<p>Paula seemed at this moment ready
to swoon; in her imagination she saw
Pastourel standing face to face with Don
Jos&eacute;, and revealing before all present the

<!-- page 46 col 1 -->

secret which the imprudent youth had
disclosed to him. She appeared to have
lost all power of speech and of motion,
when the sound of the baron's voice gave
her sufficient strength to address him,
as he said after a long silence:</p>

<p>"Well, has Don Jos&eacute; or the peasants
arrived?"</p>

<p>"Before them, or before Don Jos&eacute;,"
cried the baroness, rising, pale as death,
"there is some one to be heard."</p>

<p>"Who?" said the baron.</p>

<p>"Myself," replied Paula, sinking back
upon her chair. "Councillor Barati, you
have received my complaint; read it."</p>

<p>The baron's face was for a moment
agitated by the most contradictory emotions.
To an air of lively astonishment
succeeded an expression of savage anger:</p>

<p>"You?" he said to Paula, "you?"</p>

<p>"I!" replied Paula.</p>

<p>Then the sadness of despair fell upon
the baron, and he muttered gloomily:</p>

<p>"<i>It was true, then!</i> Read, sir," he
added to Barati, in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>Barati made a sign to Langlois to read
the writing which he had drawn up in
the dungeon. The baron remarked it,
and turning to Barati, he added bitterly,
but with true dignity:</p>

<p>"Read it yourself, sir, it needs the grave
and reverend voice of a man like you to
give me strength to listen to that which
am about to hear."</p>

<p>Still the baron seemed to distrust his
firmness, for he placed both elbows upon
the table, and concealed his face in his
hands. The baroness, with eyes fastened
upon the ground, and with drooping head,
appeared to have exhausted all her courage
in the appeal which she had made
to Barati. If she had been able, she
would fain have closed her ears to the
sound of the councillor's voice. Profound
silence reigned in the hall, and
Barati commenced the reading of Paula's
complaint.</p>

<p>The baron seemed nailed to his chair,
such was the motionless rigidity of his
position. His fingers alone, clutched
against his forehead, pressed it, as if they
would bury themselves deep in his brain.</p>

<p>During the reading, several shepherds
had entered silently, and when Barati
had concluded, and had returned the writing
to Langlois, who folded and placed it

<!-- page 46 col 2 -->


carefully beneath his doublet, the baron,
raising his head, beheld them standing
before him. Paula, with her haggard
eyes fastened upon the door, waited in
vain for the entrance of her accuser.
The baron turned toward her, saying:</p>

<p>"Madam&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose hastily, trembling and bewildered.</p>

<p>"Madam," resumed the baron, in a
calm voice, "the gates of the castle are
open, and will remain so during the whole
day. Go!"</p>

<p>The baroness bent her head, and said
quickly to the priest who sat near her:</p>

<p>"Support me, father, support me!"</p>

<p>She had tottered a few paces toward
the door, when Jean Couteau rushed wild
and disordered into the hall. All present
were startled at his paleness, and the
baroness stopped at the first word that
broke from his lips.</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;," he cried; "where is
Don Jos&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"We have been long waiting for him,"
said the baron.</p>

<p>"My lord," cried one of the menials,
"we have looked in vain in his prison,
and called after him throughout the castle&mdash;he
is not here."</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;," cried a scornful voice
from the midst of the peasants, "Don
Jos&eacute; was at break of day in the neighborhood
of the mountain of Saint Barthelmi."</p>

<p>The baron seemed strangely agitated.</p>

<p>"<i>It was true, then!</i>" he murmured.</p>

<p>"In that case," exclaimed Jean Couteau,
with the gloomy air of a man who
is in a kind of delirium, "the shepherd
was right; he saw him, indeed. Yes,
yes, Don Jos&eacute; has killed Pastourel!"</p>

<p>The cry uttered by the baroness at
hearing these words, would doubtless
have attracted general notice, and given
rise to strange comments upon the extraordinary
emotion excited by this news,
but the attention of all present was at
once diverted from Paula by an incident
which filled the inmates of the castle
with the greatest astonishment.</p>

<p>"He has killed Pastourel!" cried the
voice which had spoken before. "In
that case, no terms! War, war between
us and thine, Baron de la Roque!"</p>

<p>The speaker was Galidou, who now

<!-- page 47 col 1 -->

advanced so as to be seen by all present.
The baron remained for a moment motionless,
with his eyes fixed upon him
whom he supposed to be a phantom, then
he muttered gloomily:</p>

<p>"<i>It was true!</i>"</p>

<p>Barati himself, although he had heard
the cry of the baroness at the tidings of
Pastourel's death, was not the less surprised
at the supposed apparition. He
soon, however, resumed his calmness, and
said to Galidou:</p>

<p>"What means this, and how is it that
you were thought dead?"</p>

<p>"I will explain it," said Jean Couteau.</p>

<p>He then related the affair as it had occurred,
and at the same time recounted
how he had owed his life to Pastourel,
and how he had sworn to serve him.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the baron, whose vexation
at having played a ridiculous part banished
for a moment the peaceable and
equitable motives by which he seemed
so strongly swayed, "you have betrayed
me then, and you are not the only one,
perhaps, for Don Jos&eacute;, whom they accuse
of having slain Pastourel, wished likewise
to save the life of this boor."</p>

<p>"Did he wish to save him?" said Jean
Couteau, gazing at the baroness, who at
these words had fallen as if lifeless upon
a chair near the door.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the baron, "he did, and
so warmly that I found him last night in
my wife's chamber, imploring her to aid
him in protecting the life of this wretch."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau gazed once more at the
baroness, and muttered:</p>

<p>"And you, madam, did you wish to
save him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said, as if these were
the last words which would pass her lips.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau bent his head, and at the
moment when all present expected some
disclosure on his part, he retired, muttering:</p>

<p>"Then I have nothing more to say."</p>

<p>He turned to leave the hall.</p>

<p>"Stop that knave!" cried the baron.
"You have accused Don Jos&eacute; of the murder
of Pastourel. Did you see him commit
the deed?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you been told so?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You have supposed it?"</p>

<!-- page 47 col 2 -->

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He had reasons, then, of which you
are aware, to wish for the death of this
man?"</p>

<p>Jean Couteau, with his head bent upon
his bosom, glanced now to the right, now
to the left. At last, summoning all his
resolution, he said:</p>

<p>"There is but one man here to whom
I can speak; it is Father Anselmo, for I
have need of the absolution of a priest
for what I have seen and heard."</p>

<p>"Go," said Barati; "go!"</p>

<p>"I will await you in the confessional
of the chapel," said Father Anselmo.</p>

<p>"After me, father, after me!" said
Paula, in a whisper, and she hurried from
the apartment.</p>

<p>The baron had resumed his former
position with his elbows upon the table,
and his face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>"Does it please you, Baron de la
Roque," said Barati, mildly, "that I
should receive the depositions of these
peasants in your presence?"</p>

<p>"Do your duty, sir," said the baron.</p>

<p>"It does not oblige me to compel you
to listen to things which might irritate
you at a time when you seem already to
be suffering under misfortune."</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," replied the baron,
raising his head with a proud air, "it is
better that I should hear the crimes
which I have committed, in order to be
persuaded that I have deserved the hatred
of her who has just left us. You
can speak&mdash;all of you&mdash;for I have done
you some mischief; but she! she!"</p>

<p>He dropped his head in his hands
again, and tears were seen escaping between
his fingers, which were tightly
pressed against his forehead.</p>

<p>The depositions were now taken, and
all referred to facts similar to those of
which we have spoken at the beginning
of the scene; all ended by an appraisal
in money of the injuries in which each
one declared he had suffered.</p>

<p>At each item of evidence the councillor
said to the baron:</p>

<p>"Have you anything to advance
against this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the baron.</p>

<p>He inquired repeatedly, however, if
Don Jos&eacute; had reappeared; the answer
was invariably in the negative, and each

<!-- page 48 col 1 -->

time he resumed his position with his elbows
upon the table, and his head buried
in his hands.</p>

<p>Then, when all was finished, and a
great part of the morning had been employed
in this labor, Barati turned to the
old seigneur, and said, with a mildness
which formed a striking contrast with
the sternness which he had displayed on
the preceding evening:</p>

<p>"My lord baron, here is the report
which I am to communicate to parliament;
it cannot be but that you have
some observations to make."</p>

<p>The baron raised his head; a deathlike
paleness was spread over his visage.</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," he said, "I think
I have sufficiently understood the complaints
of these worthy people to see
that their demands against me are simply
pecuniary. To how much do they
amount?"</p>

<p>"To a hundred and twenty thousand
livres."</p>

<p>"They may share among them all the
domains that I possess in this province;
they are worth about that sum. I am
ready to resign them."</p>

<p>A prolonged murmur of astonishment
ran through the assembly.</p>

<p>"You are signing your ruin," said
Barati.</p>

<p>"What matters it?" replied the Baron
de la Roque.</p>

<p>He took up a pen, wrote a few lines,
and reached them to Barati.</p>

<p>"Will it suffice?" he said.</p>

<p>The peasants gazed at each other
with air of stupefaction. The baron
turned toward his dependents and said:</p>

<p>"As to you, you shall receive a
year's wages out of the money which
still remains in my hands. Is that
enough?"</p>

<p>"It is too much, my lord," said a few
voices.</p>

<p>The baron rose, and was about to
leave the apartment when Jean Couteau
entered, leading Paula's daughter by the
hand.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said "I was leaving
the castle when I found this child weeping
in the court."</p>

<p>"Charlotte!" exclaimed the baron with
singular emotion.</p>

<!-- page 48 col 2 -->

<p>"Mamma would not take me with her,"
said the child.</p>

<p>"Well," said the baron, "will you
remain with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," exclaimed the
old seigneur, "restore me that writing!
I had forgotten my daughter, sir."</p>

<p>An old man who held the deed in
his hands, stepped forward and tore it
in pieces.</p>

<p>"My lord baron," he said, "the poor
peasant who has but little faith in justice,
demands much to obtain a little.
You owe us forty thousand livres&mdash;that
is all."</p>

<p>"You shall have them, my honest
friends, you shall have them."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the old man, who
was no other than Gali, "we have nothing
more to do here."</p>

<p>All now left the apartment with the
exception of the baron, Barati, Jean
Couteau and Langlois.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">MYSTERIOUS DISCLOSURES.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the peasants had left the chamber,
the baron turned to Jean Couteau,
and said:</p>

<p>"And you, Jean Couteau, will you also
quit the castle?"</p>

<p>"Not now, my lord, if you still accept
my services."</p>

<p>"I will," replied baron, "on condition
that you will tell me the truth concerning
Don Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Pastourel is dead, my lord, and he
alone could tell you why Don Jos&eacute; had
reason to wish his death."</p>

<p>"Leave us, then," said the baron,
"and take this child with you. Councillor
Barati, will you not remain alone
with me! It is no longer the magistrate,
but the man of honor, with whom I wish
to consult."</p>

<p>"Will the promise which you have
just given hold good, baron! Am I to
consider the business which brought me
here as arranged between you and those
who have addressed their complaints to
the parliament?"</p>

<!-- page 49 col 1 -->

<p>"You alone doubt of it; sir," replied
the baron, "yet from the confidence with
which these very persons who look upon
me as an enemy, have entered my
castle, when I told them they had nothing
to fear, you might judge that I have
taught those who know me never to distrust
my word. Still, if it yet remains
for you to avenge the outrage which I
have committed against the parliament
in your person, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I voluntarily entered your castle;"
said Barati, "those who followed me hither
came at my express and reiterated orders,"
he added, glancing at Langlois,
"and if the reception I met with here,
was not in the outset such as I have
since found it, no one has the right to
complain, if I am satisfied. Master
Langlois, you can retire."</p>

<p>Langlois arose and left the apartment,
but the base and servile fear, which,
until now, had dwelt upon his face, gave
place to an expression of savage hate,
and a glance of menace, which included
both Barati and the baron, flashed from
his malignant eyes. Barati did not
fail to observe it, but he scorned to manifest
the slightest fear of a man like
Langlois. The baron followed him
with a thoughtful glance, and seemed to
have forgotten that he had solicited an
interview, when Barati aroused him
from his reverie, by saying:</p>

<p>"Seigneur de la Roque, I am listening."</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati, after the scene
which you witnessed in this hall last
evening, after my obstinate resistance to
the admonitions of the parliament, after all
the acts of persecution which you heard
recited, you must have been greatly
surprised at the change which has taken
place in my purpose and my views."</p>

<p>"Since you approach this subject,
sir baron, I will not conceal from you
that I have not yet recovered from my
astonishment."</p>

<p>"This astonishment will be still
greater when I tell you the cause of
this change. Look me in the face,
councillor Barati! Have I the air of a
man likely to be terrified by nursery
tales? And still, sir, it was something
similar which induced me to act as I
have done; it was a dream, a vision, an

<!-- page 49 col 2 -->

apparition from the tomb which dictated
my conduct."</p>

<p>The councillor gazed upon the baron
with extreme surprise, and the latter
continued:</p>

<p>"I am in possession of all my senses, and
that which I have just done must convince
you that something most strange
must have occurred to overcome in a
few hours the resistance which I have
so long maintained against the claims
of these new manufacturers of the
mountain&mdash;a resistance which I have
made a point of honor."</p>

<p>"I am listening to you, Baron de la
Roque," replied the councillor, "and I
beg you to believe that I respect the
means by which God brings back those
who have strayed from the path of
duty."</p>

<p>"Is it God," said the baron, in a tone
of gloom, "or is it hell that has sent
this apparition? I cannot say, but I
ought to relate it to you, for you played
your part in the scene."</p>

<p>"I?" said the councillor.</p>

<p>"You or your phantom, I known not
which; but I will tell you what I have
seen, seen clearly with open eyes, sound
senses and calm judgment."</p>

<p>"Relate it then, baron," replied the
councillor, while he tried to repress a
smile, for he remembered the means to
which the baron had resorted in order
to inflame his anger, and he imagined
that a remnant of intoxication blended
with strange emotions, which must have
disturbed him upon hearing of the fate
of Galidou, had produced dreams, which
in his alarm he had viewed as realities.</p>

<p>"You know what occurred," resumed
the baron, "up to the moment when I despatched
Jean Couteau in search of Father
Anselmo, and when I arrested Don
Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"I returned to the castle, and, as usual,
locked myself in my chamber. I undressed
and threw myself upon my bed,
but I could not sleep, the image of Galidou,
torn in pieces by my dogs, haunted
me incessantly. Suddenly I heard a
strange noise, as if some one was trying
to force open the door of my chamber,
and I half rose, and cried, 'who is
there?' No voice replied, but at the
same moment I felt myself seized and

<!-- page 50 col 1 -->

thrown back upon my bed. I was
then bound upon it, and a covering was
thrown about my head to stifle my cries,
and I heard the following words, distinctly
uttered in my ear: '<i>Resistance
is vain against the messengers of God!</i>'</p>

<p>"I am not a man to be frightened at so
slight a matter, sir councillor, and I resolved
to keep quiet, so as to observe
what passed around me. Besides, those
who had been enabled to find their way
thus into my chamber, could have slain
me if such had been their purpose, and although
I did not know what they were
about to do, yet I supposed it necessary
to obey. My suspense was but short.
After a few moments of profound silence,
I felt the covering removed from my
face, and beheld my chamber brightly
illuminated."</p>

<p>The councillor was unable to repress
a smile, but the baron continued in
a dry tone:</p>

<p>"I am neither a child nor a coward,
sir; that which I tell you is pure truth;
I was not thrown backward upon my
bed by a force which I could not comprehend;
they were the hands of men
which grasped me, they were real hands
which held me; and that dazzling light
was no will-o'-the-wisp; it was caused
by a number of tapers which were fastened
to the various articles of furniture
in my chamber. Four men with long
cutlasses stood at my bedside, two on
either hand: their faces were masked,
and I beheld nought but the gleaming
of their eyes fixed upon me, as if to watch
for the slightest attempt on my part to
call for aid or to resist."</p>

<p>The councillor assumed a more serious
air at hearing these circumstantial
details, which proved that the man had
seen and observed with considerable
calmness, and he made a sign to the
baron, as if to assure him of the interest
which he took in his narrative. The
baron continued:</p>

<p>"These circumstances, sir, satisfied
me that I was in the hands of human
beings, and I resolved to watch their
every action, and to listen carefully to
every word which fell from their lips.</p>

<p>"After having closely examined the
four masked men, who stood over me
with their cutlasses, I turned my eyes

<!-- page 50 col 2 -->

from them, and beheld in front of me
three others, seated at a table, like
judges. Before each stood a torch, so
that the brightness of the light, flashing
between them and me, prevented me
from recognizing their features. It seemed
as if they divined my wish, for the
first&mdash;commencing upon my left hand&mdash;(I
observed every thing with great accuracy)&mdash;the
first, I say, took his torch,
and holding it near his face, said to me,
in a hollow voice:</p>

<p>" 'Dost thou recognise me?'</p>

<p>"It was Don Jos&eacute;, his face pale and
rigid, like that of a corpse. The one at
the other extremity did the same, and
this time I was unable to repress a cry
of terror, as I beheld Galidou, pale as
Don Jos&eacute;, but with a long stain of blood
upon his forehead. Do not forget, sir,"
said the baron, "that I thought he had
perished miserably!"</p>

<p>"Neither forget," said the councillor,
"that he was at liberty, and Don Jos&eacute;
also, and that with an adroit trick&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you, then, at liberty also, sir
councillor?" said the baron, "for he
who was in the middle, having risen and
displayed his features in the same wise,
I recognised you, pale like the others,
with a face livid and motionless; and
you said, with that menacing voice which
echoed through this hall last evening:</p>

<p>" 'Baron, thy three prisoners are here
to sit in judgment upon thee!' "</p>

<p>The baron spoke with such an air of
conviction; he appeared so little affected
by the terror which that vision would
naturally have produced upon him, that
Barati was upon the point of yielding to
a feeling of superstitious fear, but blushing
at the thought of evincing more emotion
at the bare recital than the baron
seemed to have felt at the actual apparition,
he said:</p>

<p>"Baron, it is not astonishing that after
what had taken place, you gave to these
fantastic shadows the images of those
whom you had destined to death, perhaps."</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque turned up the
sleeves of his coat, and showing the councillor
his bruised and discolored wrists,
he replied, with some anger:</p>

<p>"They are not the shadows of cords
which can thus lacerate the limbs of

<!-- page 51 col 1 -->

man; my imagination has not produced
these deep scars which you behold; it
gave to none of those forms the faces
that I beheld; they were realities."</p>

<p>"And you examined them carefully?"
said Barati, in undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>"As well as I could in the position in
which I lay, for each one having resumed
his seat, and placed his torch
before him, the rays of light covered
them, as it were, with a luminous veil,
which my eyes could only pierce when,
by chance, they leaned to the right or to
the left; but it was because I looked
upon this arrangement as a precaution
to prevent me from scanning their features,
that I seized each opportunity to
observe them. Every time that I beheld
them, I recognised the same faces,
rigid, pallid, and presenting the aspect
of death."</p>

<p>While the councillor listened, the expression
of his features changed alternately
from astonishment to incredulity,
as by turns the singularity of the baron's
recital impressed him, or as his reason
convinced him that it was the dream of
a drunken man. The baron comprehended
what was passing in Barati's
mind, and added quickly:</p>

<p>"I tell you once more, master councillor,
I am not a child to be terrified by
will o' the wisps or painted puppets, and
as I am sure that I was not duped by
my imagination, I could, as well as you,
find a probable explanation of these resemblances,
if there were not powerful
reasons, which induce me to look upon
this scene as something supernatural."</p>

<p>"It may be so, baron," replied the
councillor, "and when you have told me
the rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The rest, sir, the rest, will alarm
you more than me, perhaps," replied
the old seigneur, bitterly. "My judges
had resumed their places, as I have told
you, and he who wore your face, began
and said: 'Baron de la Roque, thou
hast endeavored to resist the orders of
the parliament, and the parliament has
sent me to judge thee, not only for the
crimes which thou hast committed before
the eyes of men, but for those which
thou dost think forever buried in the
vaults of this castle.' "</p>

<p>The councillor lent a more attentive

<!-- page 51 col 2 -->

ear, stupefied to see the baron, whom he
still supposed to be suffering from a
species of delirium, ready to reveal those
crimes for which he must necessarily
call him to an account.</p>

<p>The baron continued:</p>

<p>"I grant that these words alarmed
me, and I felt my courage fast leaving
me when the phantom judge resumed:
'Dost thou remember the night when
the Comte de Frias came with a valise
filled with gold and jewelry, to ask an
asylum of thee? Thou didst grant it
eagerly, and on the morrow, when his
young son, then scarcely ten years of
age, awoke, thou didst say to him, that
his father had been obliged to leave the
castle in the night, and that he had left
him in thy keeping. The boy believed
thee, and afterward thou didst inform
him that his father had sailed for the
Indies, and didst show him a ring set
with diamonds, which he sent thee to be
given to Don Jos&eacute;, and the boy who had
often seen this ring upon his father's
finger, believed that still, and it is now
near fifteen years that he whom thou
dost call thy ward, has been waiting for
the arrival of his father, whose corpse is
still in the dark dungeons into which
thou didst hurl it, and which thou hast
not since dared to enter.' "</p>

<p>"Baron, baron!" cried the councillor,
rising quickly, "is this true? is it true?"</p>

<p>The baron signed to him to resume
his seat, and rejoined, without appearing
to be moved by the councillor's violent
indignation:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it is true. On that day poverty
was a guest in my house, and on the
morrow I was to repay to the Comte de
Labastide the sum of ten thousand livres.
To fail in the payment of a debt to a usurer
or a merchant, disturbs one but little,
for these people have the law and the
bailiffs on their side; but to be unable
to restore a sum, borrowed from a gentleman
upon the word of a gentleman&mdash;it
was the loss of my honor, and I could
not suffer that. It must have been the
devil, sir, who sent the Comte de Frias
to La Roque that very evening, for it
was not his intention; he was returning
from Toulouse to Spain, and it was the
fatigue of his young son, which compelled
him to stop at my castle."</p>

<!-- page 52 col 1 -->

<p>"And do you dare to make this disclosure
to me, sir baron?" said Barati,
sternly.</p>

<p>"I supposed I was speaking to a man
of honor," said the baron, in a tone of
raillery, "for I was careful to ask you
if the office of magistrate was ended."</p>

<p>"It is ended, sir," replied Barati, "and
as a member of parliament, I will forget
what you have now told me, but I warn
you that I am unwilling, even as a private
man, to hear the recital of these visions,
engendered by your remorse."</p>

<p>Barati rose to leave the apartment,
but at the same moment the Baron de la
Roque said to him:</p>

<p>"You would perhaps listen more attentively
sir, if instead of speaking of
a crime, committed fifteen years ago,
I should speak to you of one committed
at a distance of twenty-five, when a
young girl wrapped in a mantle, entered
by night the house of an inn-keeper,
named Vergnes, who dwelt in the suburbs
of Toulouse, and deposited there a
new-born infant, which she brought in
an osier cradle."</p>

<p>"Baron! baron! what mean you!
It is not true! they have lied!"</p>

<p>"Who have lied, sir?" replied the
baron, with a smile of scorn, "these
visions engendered by my remorse?"</p>

<p>Barati fell backward upon a chair in
a state of frightful agitation, and but for
the calm visage of the baron, who
gazed upon him with a cruel smile, he
would have thought himself the sport of
a dream.</p>

<p>"They told me truly," resumed the
Baron de la Roque, "that these words
would silence the arrogance, beneath
which you have for five and twenty
years concealed the crime which you
then committed."</p>

<p>Barati cast a wild glance around the
apartment, and then directed it toward
the baron with such fury that the latter
added:</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati, there is no way
to rid yourself of me. I am armed,"
he continued, drawing forth a pistol,
"you are not. Besides, my menials
would enter at the first cry."</p>

<p>"And can no one hear us?" said Barati
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Who knows, sir, if those who have

<!-- page 52 col 2 -->

revealed this secret to me, do not hear
all that is said in all places? For they
know of Don Jos&eacute;'s flight, they told me
that Galidou was saved, and they repeated
word for word the complaint of
Paula."</p>

<p>"And still, sir, your surprise was great
when you heard these things?"</p>

<p>"It was not at hearing them, sir, that
I was surprised, but at beholding fulfilled
at that hour, word for word, that which
had been foretold to me, as at this moment
the prediction is fulfilled that the
mention or the night of the 20th of November,
1683, would render you more
humble and attentive."</p>

<p>"Finish then, sir," replied Barati,
with a gloomy and troubled voice: "finish,
for they must have told you other
things."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," resumed the baron, "after
having recalled to me the crime&mdash;I
mean my own&mdash;the spectre who wore
your visage, continued: 'We know,'
he said, 'your project to dispose of me.'
Then he who wore the visage of Don
Jos&eacute;, added: 'and it was to me that you
would have entrusted the commission
of this crime.' "</p>

<p>"Was it true, sir?" said Barati in
amazement.</p>

<p>"It was true, sir," replied the baron,
"it seems that not a single word was
uttered last night in this castle, which
was not heard by these envoys of hell.
What is there wonderful in that, when
they are so well acquainted with things
which we thought buried in night, and
in the oblivion of the tomb."</p>

<p>"And so, sir," rejoined Barati, who had
somewhat recovered from his surprise, "it
is to the intervention of these supernatural
beings that I owe my safety?"</p>

<p>"Jos&eacute; had refused, sir, to obey my
orders, and although he afterwards consented
to rid me of you, upon the condition
that I would save Galidou, I am
convinced he would not have kept his
promise."</p>

<p>A heavy sigh broke from the councillor's
bosom, and he said in a hollow
voice:</p>

<p>"This passes belief; it is enough to
turn one's brain."</p>

<p>"This is not all, councillor Barati. If
I testified no surprise on hearing of the

<!-- page 53 col 1 -->

death of Pastourel, it was because no
expression, no emotion could suffice to
paint my astonishment, for I already
knew of it."</p>

<p>"Was it Don Jos&eacute; who killed Pastourel?"
said Barati, with an air of
burning curiosity.</p>

<p>"He who wore his visage said to me,
'I will slay Pastourel, because he knows
what he should not know.' But he who
said this, was no more young Frias, than
he who wore your face was you, councillor
Barati."</p>

<p>"In truth, in truth," muttered Barati,
utterly bewildered by what he had
heard, "nothing proves that it was Don
Jos&eacute;. But, baron, did they tell you the
secret which was to lead to the death of
Pastourel?"</p>

<p>The baron was agitated at this question;
his face became pale and anxious,
and he replied:</p>

<p>"I inquired after it, and do you know
what he, who wore the features of Galidou,
answered: 'If the councillor
Barati will tell you why he committed the
crime which we have revealed, you
shall know why Pastourel must die.' "</p>

<p>"Oh, spectres of hell!" said Barati,
with a fury which his calm features
seemed incapable of expressing, "they
know all!"</p>

<p>He then leaned toward the baron,
with flashing eyes and hands convulsively
agitated, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"And have they told you nothing
more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the baron. "But
you," he added, gazing earnestly at Barati,
"will you not tell me this secret?"</p>

<p>Barati did not at once reply; he lowered
his eyes, as if to retire within
himself and to take secret council of
his own bosom; then he cried with energy:</p>

<p>"Never, sir, never!"</p>

<p>The baron smiled bitterly, and
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, they warned me that you
would refuse, but they told me also that
the day would come when your lips
would be unclosed."</p>

<p>"Never, sir, never!" repeated Barati,
violently.</p>

<p>"The day when this castle falls into
the hands of the parliament."</p>

<!-- page 53 col 2 -->

<p>"How so?" said Barati.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir councillor, on the day
when the inquest which you have directed
against me, shall have thrown
open this castle to the agents of the
parliament, your secret will be divulged:
and this morning, if you had not accepted
the reparation which I offered to
the inhabitants of this district, my crime
and yours would both have been brought
to light.&mdash;But it is time to end, sir," added
the baron, to whom this scene seemed
to become more and more painful.
"The conduct that I have pursued this
morning, has been traced out to me step
by step. If you had not responded
to it voluntarily, I was in possession of
the means to compel you, by placing
in your hands this billet."</p>

<p>Barati took it, and read the following
words:</p>

<p>"He who opposes the reparation of
another's crimes, is his conscience pure?
Is the 20th of November, 1683, effaced
from his memory?"</p>

<p>The councillor crushed the billet in
his hands, and was about to tear it, but
he at once unfolded it carefully again,
and examined it.</p>

<p>"Is this writing known to you?" said
the baron.</p>

<p>"I am not in habitual correspondence
with spirits of the other world," replied
the councillor coldly, and he thrust the
billet in his pocket.</p>

<p>"You cannot keep that billet," said
the baron, "it must be destroyed; such
is the order."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Barati, "slight as
is this evidence of infernal jugglery, I
will keep it."</p>

<p>"You will return it to me, sir," said
the baron. "When I formally promised
those three messengers of vengeance
and of terror to obey their bidding, I
swore that I would use this billet only to
warn you of the necessity of accepting
the reparation which I offered, and if
you will examine it carefully, you will
doubtless find a word that has a meaning
for you, which I do not comprehend."</p>

<p>Barati turned the page, and read the
single word: "<i>Uri!</i>"* followed by the
date, "<i>Dec</i>. 3<i>d</i>, 1684."</p>

<p class="small">[*Uri&mdash;to be burned.]</p>

<!-- page 54 col 1 -->

<p>The effect produced by this word upon
the councillor, was even more frightful
than that which he had felt at the mention
of the date of the 20th of November.
He gazed at the fatal word, with haggard
eyes, despairing face, panting breath,
and uttering convulsively and at intervals
the words:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;fire&mdash;baron, a brazier&mdash;a
taper!"</p>

<p>The baron struck upon the table; a
domestic entered, raising the piece of
tapestry which hung against the folding
door of the hall.</p>

<p>"A taper!" said the baron, without
looking up.</p>

<p>"Here is one," said the domestic, who
held it in his hand.</p>

<p>The baron raised his head, and starting
up in alarm, he cried:</p>

<p>"Who art thou? whence comest thou?"</p>

<p>Barati gazed upon him in his turn; he
beheld the pale and rigid face of a lean
old man. Barati uttered a fearful cry,
and fell backward upon his chair. The
old man reached him the taper, and pronounced
in a hollow voice the fatal word
that was written upon the billet: "<i>Uri!</i>"</p>

<p>Barati mechanically obeyed, and approached
the billet to the flame; scarcely
was it consumed, when the domestic
withdrew.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the baron, starting
from his seat, "this one is a human being;
it is now day, I will find him!"</p>

<p>He hurried toward the door, threw it
open, and entered the apartments without,
in which he found a few domestics
with Langlois, and said:</p>

<p>"What has become of the man who
entered the hall, and has just left it."</p>

<p>"We have seen no one, my lord," said
one of those whom he addressed.</p>

<p>The baron durst not add a word, and
returned at once to the hall. Barati,
bent upon his chair, with his eyes fastened
upon the door, seemed like a man deprived
of reason.</p>

<p>"Was it no one," he said, "no one?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Oh! I knew it. The dead can return
to their tombs as they leave them."</p>

<p>"Did you recognise him, then?" said
the baron.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;" replied Barati. "Oh,
heaven is in arms against us. We are

<!-- page 54 col 2 -->

lost!" he added, letting his head fall upon
the table.</p>

<p>"No," said the baron, "But a single
danger exists for you as well as for me."</p>

<p>Barati raised his head.</p>

<p>"And this danger," added the baron,
sinking his voice, "lies in the man who
accompanied you hither."</p>

<p>"Langlois?"</p>

<p>"The same, councillor Barati."</p>

<p>"What can he do against you?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Or against me?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"What! have they told you nothing
of the danger to which this man can expose
us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Not a word of the means to prevent
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>Barati appeared confounded, and he
murmured in a hollow tone:</p>

<p>"Oh, there is always a way to silence
such a man."</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," said the baron,
"as your death would have been the signal
for my ruin, so the death of Langlois
would be the signal for yours. This
man must live, and he must be silent for
eight days. Thus much they told me."</p>

<p>"But of what must he be silent?"</p>

<p>"Not one of the complaints which you
have received against me, must reach
the ears of the parliament. My life and
yours depend upon it. I have already
told you that if a soldier of the king or
an officer of justice, crosses the threshold
of this castle, we are both lost!"</p>

<p>A glance of triumph gleamed from the
baron's eye, and Barati replied:</p>

<p>"Well, then, in one way or another he
shall be silent, should it cost me my entire
fortune. Is this all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the baron, "the rest concerns
myself alone."</p>

<p>"And how did this frightful scene terminate?"</p>

<p>"As it began. They wrapped my
face in the covering, my limbs were unbound,
and when I looked up, I was in
my chamber, and on my bed. The day
was beginning to dawn; I commanded
my vassals to inform the peasants of your
presence at the castle, and prepared everything
for the reparation of which you

<!-- page 55 col 1 -->

were a witness, without asking a question
of you or of Paula, or inquiring after
Galidou, but obeying blindly all that had
been prescribed to me. You must now
see, sir councillor, that in my place you
would have done the same."</p>

<p>"And I will obey as you have obeyed,"
replied Barati, as if he were addressing
the supernatural beings by whom he
fancied himself surrounded, rather than
speaking to the baron himself.</p>

<p>"In that case, sir," answered the baron,
"you should set out immediately.
Your horses are ready, and you have no
need of a guide."</p>

<p>"Are we to meet again, Baron de la
Roque?" said Barati.</p>

<p>"I do not know,"</p>

<p>"Adieu, then, sir; I will not forget
that the Comte de Frias entered this castle
never to leave it."</p>

<p>"And, sir, I have stamped upon my
memory the date of the 20th of November."</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque and the Councillor
Barati saluted each other profoundly
and separated.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">THE PHANTOM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of the day on which
Barati left the castle of La Roque after
his interview with the baron, at the moment
when twilight began to cast its faint
shadows upon the deep valleys, while
the summits of the mountain were still tinged
with a roseate light, Jean Couteau was
seated upon a rock called the Devil's
Pulpit. Imagine, in the first place, two
lofty and parallel hills, separated by a
torrent flowing amid enormous rocks, at
a depth of more than three hundred
feet; the opposing sides of these hills
were covered with box trees and holm
oaks, so thickly set that it seemed impossible
for the foot of man to force a passage
through them, while, at intervals,
varying the uniformity of this dark green
mass, a few points of white rock projected
horizontally from this gloomy shroud
of foliage, the last vestiges of the fearful
convulsions which had thrown up
this mountain, vestiges which vegetation

<!-- page 55 col 2 -->

had not been able to conceal. The boldest
of these rocks, stretching from the
summit of one of these hills, almost
reached the middle of the space which
separated them, and it was at its extremity
alone, that the spectator could look
down into the abyss, as a sailor, seated at
the end of a horizontal yard, sees the
ocean at his feet; it was here alone that
one could see the torrent which flowed at
the bottom of the ravine, for the trees
which extended to the very margin of
the Slers, and which drooped over its
waters, concealed it from those who
would view its course from either of the
two opposite summits.</p>

<p>It was upon this rock that Jean Couteau
was now seated, and his glance could
reach almost in a right line to the spot
where these twin hills stretched like two
formidable bastions from the flank of a
lofty mountain, while the rocks which
enclosed the bed of the torrent, ran like
a colossal stair-way up its acclivity.
When they had reached nearly two-thirds
of the height of those hills, they
terminated suddenly in a vast mass of
uncouth rocks, surmounted by a grove
of fir trees, and from which flowed the
stream which fed the Slers. But this
source was insufficient to envelop those
enormous and irregular masses, covered
with moss and lichens, and flowed merely
between the deep clefts which severed
them. Owing to this, at the moment
of which we speak, illumined as it was
by the setting sun whose rays directly
penetrated the gorge of the Slers, it offered
the spectacle of a magnificent ribbon,
checkered with gold and silver
scales, thrown across a broad band of
green velvet, with its hues here deepening
into black, here fading into grey.</p>

<p>A few feet above the spot where the
source made its appearance, a rook
formed a species of platform, sheltered
by a second fragment which surmounted
it, like the arch of a niche. On this
platform was a large fissure, which
might end at the depth of a few fathoms,
or might reach into the very heart of
the mountain. No one knew which, for
this opening, encompassed on every side
by salient rocks, was inaccessible even
to the boldest hunters.</p>

<p>It was called the Wolf's Niche. This

<!-- page 56 col 1 -->

name originated from the sudden appearance
of a wolf upon this platform, more
than two centuries ago. How it had
reached this spot no one could tell. It
had been seen for several days in succession,
wandering around this rock and
uttering fearful howls, until, at last,
urged by hunger and by thirst, it endeavored
to descend the rocks, and was
precipitated into the bottom of the abyss.
From this, it was supposed that this fissure,
which was visible at a distance,
did not extend into the interior of the
mountain; for otherwise the wolf would
not have failed to retire into it from time
to time, to seek another way of issue,
and from the moment when it was first
seen, it had not left the platform.</p>

<p>This picturesque spot was situated on
the farther slope of the mountain upon
which stood the castle of La Roque, and
Jean Couteau, seated as we have said,
upon the rock which hung over the ravine,
was reflecting that it was yet necessary
for him to cross the crest of the
hill, then climb the summit of the mountain,
and descend on the other side before
he could reach the castle. Under
ordinary circumstances it would have
been but the labor of an hour, but on
this day he was so worn with fatigue
that he could not hope to reach it before
night, and Jean Couteau, the bear-hunter,
dreaded nothing so much as the darkness.
Still, such was his weariness that
he suffered the gloom to increase upon
him, without making an effort to proceed
upon his route. With his eyes sadly
fastened upon the torrent, he followed all
its windings, without, as it were, perceiving
them.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a low voice,
"yes, some misfortune impends over our
heads!"</p>

<p>This thought, added to the steadfastness
with which he gazed upon the torrent,
rendered him dizzy; he felt himself
seized with that strange frenzy
caused by the vapors of an abyss, and
which urges us to plunge into the immense
void that lies spread beneath the
glance. He started up in affright to
dispel the charm, and, to free himself
from this powerful fascination, he looked
out into the distance. The last rays of
the sun were falling full upon the Wolf's

<!-- page 56 col 2 -->

Niche, and he started in alarm, for it
seemed to him as if the platform was
occupied.</p>

<p>As he had dispelled the dizziness
which had seized him, he endeavored
also to chase away this species of delirium
which displayed to him an animate
object upon this inaccessible rock; he
closed his eyes to repeat a prayer, and
opened them again in the firm belief that
the apparition must have vanished. But
now, on the contrary, he beheld still
more distinctly the outlines of a human
form, drawn upon the back-ground of
the cavity, and upon examining the
stature of this man, his large felt hat, his
attitude slightly bent, as if he were supported
upon a long staff, Jean Couteau
could not mistake Pastourel, or rather
the shade of Pastourel.</p>

<p>After another prayer he gazed with
more tranquillity upon the fearful apparition,
and convinced himself that it was
the ghost of Pastourel, if not Pastourel
in reality. Still, however, it stood motionless,
and Jean Couteau began to hope
that nothing farther would occur to alarm
him, when suddenly the form moved,
and soon a distant voice reached his ear;
he heard his name uttered distinctly,
and he recognized, as he thought, the
voice of Pastourel, and it seemed to say:</p>

<p>"Jean! Jean! Come! come!"</p>

<p>At this appeal, the easier to resist the
impulse that seized him, and urged him
to plunge into the abyss, Jean Couteau
threw himself upon his knees, and prayed
aloud in order to drown the infernal
voice which summoned him. Invigorated
by this act of devotion, he rose,
and without turning his eyes toward the
Wolf's Niche, started on his way to the
castle.</p>

<p>If the reader has well understood the
description that we have given of this
picturesque scene, he will perceive that
by following the hill which joined the
mountain, Jean must necessarily approach
the Wolf's Niche; but the density
of the thicket which bordered the
path which he trod, concealed this fearful
spot, and in the agitation which
troubled him, our hunter thought himself
still at a distance from it, when,
through an opening which he had never
before observed, he beheld the rock, the

<!-- page 57 col 1 -->

platform, and Pastourel a few fathoms
above him. The shepherd seemed to be
waiting for the moment when his old
friend should pass. In truth, the same
voice which had already called Jean
Couteau was heard anew, uttering distinctly
the following words:</p>

<p>"You will soon be questioned; but remember
that <i>speech is silver, but silence
is gold</i>."</p>

<p>The shadow placed its finger upon its
lips, as if to give emphasis to this magical
sentence; then, while the hunter,
with trembling knees, crossed himself In
vain to exorcise this diabolical apparition,
the shade, assuming an attitude of
command, signed to him to proceed upon
his way. It was obeying the devil, but
Jean Couteau did not pause at this subtle
distinction, and for the second time he
took to flight in wild terror. He reached
at last, the gate of the castle, uncertain
what to do, but resolved to act upon the
inspiration of the moment, divided as he
was between the fear of obeying and of
disobeying the counsel which he had
just received.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he crossed the threshold
of the outer gate, when he was told that
the baron wished to speak with him.
Jean Couteau hastened to obey, hoping
to find in the presence of the Baron de
la Roque, a refuge against the horrible
hallucinations which mocked him; but
the first question which the baron addressed
to him, reminded him of the injunction
which he had received.</p>

<p>"Well then, Jean!" he said, "what
have you discovered?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my lord, nothing which
could satisfy you."</p>

<p>"The baroness then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is not at the convent of La Madeline,
neither is she with the beguines of
Razepont, nor with the Carmelites of
Mars d'Albert."</p>

<p>Have you not been to Saint Benoit?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Jean Couteau, "I
went last night to Father Anselmo's;
this morning I crossed to Saint Barthelmi;
in the course of the day I returned
to the castle, and I have since been to
the places I have mentioned. I do not
think that there are many men capable,
after such a walk, of crossing to Saint

<!-- page 57 col 2 -->

Benoit, which is more than two leagues
in a direction entirely opposite."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the baron,
"and you must be weary."</p>

<p>He rang, and a domestic having appeared,
he directed him to prepare supper,
and to place two plates upon the
table. Jean Couteau would have excused
himself, but the baron said:</p>

<p>"Remain, remain, Jean! There is an
end to all ceremony now. The proud
baroness has left the old mansion; we
will resume our joyous suppers as of
old, we will renew our hunts across
the mountain, and laugh at the fools who
say I do not maintain my dignity."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau scanned the baron by
the light of the tapers which were
brought in, and observed that he had
already anticipated his supper. His
eyes gleamed with a savage fire, and
Jean replied:</p>

<p>"My lord, you were this morning justice
and honor personified, but it seems
to me that this evening, an evil spirit has
seized upon you."</p>

<p>"I fear neither spirits nor demons!"
cried the baron, as if addressing himself
to the walls of his chamber. "Let
them come! I dread them no longer."</p>

<p>And he placed near him his sword, a
long poignard, and a pair of pistols.</p>

<p>"Come," he resumed, turning to Jean
Couteau, "drain a cup, and tell me the
truth."</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Jean Couteau,
with a firm but modest air, "wine oftentimes
takes away the memory of that
which we ought not to forget, and brings
to our lips that which we ought never to
utter. I will not drink!"</p>

<p>"There are things, then, which you
ought not to forget, and things which you
ought not to utter?"</p>

<p>"It is possible, my lord, and in that I
am like the most of mankind. If, for
example," he added, gently, "if I were
a father, I would not forget that I ought
to care for the future fate of my daughter."</p>

<p>The baron gazed at Jean Couteau
with an air of menace, and replied:</p>

<p>"My daughter! you would speak of
my daughter?"</p>

<p>He checked himself as he was about
to utter wild imprecations against this

<!-- page 58 col 1 -->

innocent child, and added, with an air
of indifference, as he helped Jean to a
morsel:</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean, if you were a father, you
would not forget the future fate of your
daughter, and that which you ought not
to utter is this&mdash;that you do not think&mdash;that
you fear she is not&mdash;help me a little,
old Jean! When we hunted together,
and I had found the track, but was not quite
sure of it, you would help me, and say:
"You are upon the track; follow, follow,
and you will find the game!"</p>

<p>Jean Couteau trembled internally, but
he was able to conceal his emotion, and
he replied without hesitation:</p>

<p>"There is no fear of following the
wrong track in following the law of God,
which says that a father should watch
over his child."</p>

<p>The baron started, and took from the
corner of his arm-chair a bag filled with
silver; he threw it upon the table, and
cried, in a sharp and angry voice:</p>

<p>"There, Jean Couteau, that is yours,
if you will tell me why Don Jos&eacute; killed
Pastourel!"</p>

<p>The words uttered by the shepherd's
shadow, "<i>speech is silver, but silence is
gold</i>," seemed now to have a meaning,
and whether that Jean knew well how
to distinguish between the metals, and
hoped to see the silver changed into gold,
or whether a superstitious fear spoke
louder than the jingle of the crowns, he
replied, casting a side glance at the bag:</p>

<p>"I am poor, my lord, and this money,
if it could help me purchase my son's
liberty from the army, would give me
the greatest pleasure that a father can
feel; but I cannot do that which is impossible,
I cannot say that which I do
not truly know."</p>

<p>A thought now suddenly came to the
assistance of Jean Couteau, and he continued:</p>

<p>"I cannot even say that it was Don
Jos&eacute; who killed Pastourel, for I did not
see him."</p>

<p>He then added:</p>

<p>And who knows if Pastourel is dead?"</p>

<p>"Did you not see him on the ground,
bleeding, lifeless?"</p>

<p>"It is true, I saw him thus, but since
then I have seen him erect, and like a
living man."</p>

<!-- page 58 col 2 -->

<p>"And you did not take him by the
throat! you did not arrest him? It was
daylight, you had your hands free, and
you did not satisfy yourself, whether it
were a demon, or a man of flesh and
bones! You were afraid, Jean Couteau!"</p>

<p>"I do not deny it, my lord, and if you
had seen him as I did in the Wolf's
Niche, you would hardly have been
tempted to assail him, but would have
asked yourself if it were possible that a
living man could mount to that spot or
return again."</p>

<p>It seemed as if Jean Couteau's words
had confirmed a suspicion which had
already taken root in the baron's mmd;
his eye flashed with strange satisfaction,
and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is so! it must be so!"</p>

<p>"What?" said Jean Couteau.</p>

<p>The baron assumed a humble and
hypocritical air, and replied, in a drawling
tone:</p>

<p>"Yes! God must have permitted the
dead to leave their tombs, to admonish
and exhort the living."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, it is so," said Jean Couteau,
who did not suspect the sincerity
of the baron's words.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old man, "and the
wisest course is to submit."</p>

<p>He cast abound the chamber a glance
which Jean Couteau followed with astonishment,
and then added in the same
meek tone:</p>

<p>"And may they pardon those, who,
in their senseless temerity, have for a
moment cherished the thought of penetrating
these gloomy mysteries."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau started and rose from
his seat, for the manner in which the
baron had uttered these words, and had
glanced around him, seemed to indicate
that he believed he was conversing with
spirits as if they were present.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said, with a troubled
voice, "have you witnessed, then, any
extraordinary apparitions? Have you
heard the voices of those who are no
more?"</p>

<p>"My poor Jean Couteau," replied the
baron, "it is always better to keep silence
than to speak, according to the favorite
maxim of the old Comte de Frias, an

<!-- page 59 col 1 -->

Arabian maxim which he learned in
Africa, when he was governor of the
Pr&eacute;sides."</p>

<p>"And this maxim?" said Jean.</p>

<p>"It was this&mdash;<i>that speech is silver, but
silence is gold</i>."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau gazed at the baron with
alarm; he thought that his master knew
what the shade of Pastourel had said to
him, for this phrase was too singular to
be repeated by mere accident.</p>

<p>"And this, you say, was the favorite
maxim of the Comte de Frias?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean."</p>

<p>"In that case it is the favorite maxim
of the dead also, for Pastourel repeated
it to me to-day."</p>

<p>"Pastourel!" cried the baron, "Pastourel
repeated this sentence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," said Jean, "and as
if it were an order that I must not disobey."</p>

<p>The baron seemed to grow suddenly
thoughtful, and after a gloomy silence,
he said to the hunter:</p>

<p>"My poor Jean, you must submit;
keep your secret then; we must not
offend the dead. But let us speak no
longer of things which it is forbidden us
to comprehend. Jean, I shall leave to-morrow
for Toulouse; will you accompany
me?"</p>

<p>"My lord, I will do whatever you
command."</p>

<p>"Well, then! since I still have a
faithful servant left, you shall go with
me."</p>

<p>"Where you go, my lord, I will go;
but are you not afraid to place your head
thus in the jaws of the Wolf? The arrest
of the councillor Barati, is a crime
in the eyes of parliament, for which
they may punish you."</p>

<p>"Barati has given me his word that
the whole affair is arranged."</p>

<p>"Can the word of a gownsman be
trusted?"</p>

<p>"It is what it is," said the baron,
impatiently. "I set out to-morrow for
Toulouse. You can now withdraw."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau rose, and left his master's
chamber, but in passing one of the
outer halls, he beheld a tall white figure
approaching him, and a low voice whispered
in his ear the words which he
had already heard: <i>Speech is silver, but

<!-- page 59 col 2 -->

silence is gold</i>. At the same moment
he felt a purse placed in his hand. Jean
uttered a cry of terror, which at once
summoned the baron. The latter found
him upon his knees with his face to the
earth, and smiting himself upon his
breast. The purse was on the ground
near him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said the baron.</p>

<p>Jean, with a faltering voice, repeated
the fatal sentence, and pointed to the
purse. The baron raised it from the
ground, and saw that it was filled with
good and genuine double louis. A smile
of joy rose to his lips, but he crossed
himself devoutly, and replied in an humble,
timorous tone:</p>

<p>"The castle is haunted by the
damned! I will not pass another night
within it. Come, Jean, come!"</p>

<p>The hunter suffered the baron to lead
him onward without knowing whither,
and it was not until the old seigneur
pushed him into the famous kennel, in
which Galidou had been confined, that
he heard the baron say in a low voice:</p>

<p>"You can sleep in the kennel; the
dogs have sharp teeth, and no spirits
will visit you here."</p>

<p>"What mean you, my lord?"</p>

<p>"I will explain it to you to-morrow,"
said the baron.</p>

<p>He then directed him to mount to the
loft, locked the gate of the kennel, took
the key, and retired.</p>

<p>On the following morning the baron
came himself to liberate Jean Couteau,
and inquired how he had passed the
night.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" replied the latter. "You
were right, nothing disturbed my slumber.
And you, my lord baron?"</p>

<p>"I?" replied the old seigneur, with a
sarcastic smile. "I found it pleasant to
pass the night in my wife's chamber."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jean Couteau, "and
nothing happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a bad dream," said the
baron, fixing a keen glance upon Jean.
"I thought I saw Paula escaping with
Don Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>Jean could scarcely conceal his agitation,
and hoping to turn aside suspicion
by changing the conversation, he said:</p>

<p>"And the child&mdash;will you leave it at
the castle?"</p>

<!-- page 60 col 1 -->

<p>"No, no," said the baron. "I sent
Charlotte, yesterday, to my brother
D'Auterive, to place her in safety against
evil spirits. But despatch; my horses
are ready, and we must be at Toulouse
this evening."</p>

<p>Before leaving, Jean Couteau wished
to say adieu to some of the baron's domestics,
not knowing, as he said, whether
he should ever return from so long a
journey; but the baron would not suffer
it, and the groom who held Jean's bridle,
said to him in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Your request is useless; the baron
has dismissed them all during the night,
and God knows whither he has sent them."</p>

<p>"To the devil! whither he is taking
me perhaps," muttered Jean.</p>

<p>They gave their horses the spur, and
took the road to the capital of Languedoc.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">THE EXAMINATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will avail ourselves of the privilege
of the novelist, and take this long
journey in a few seconds; we will
reach Toulouse at the very hour when
the baron left the castle of La Roque,
and proceed at once to the house of
Barati.</p>

<p>The councillor was in an ample
wainscotted chamber, which was lighted
by a wide and lofty window, that afforded
free passage to the rays without. He
was seated in front of a large table that
was covered with papers; his head was
bent upon his breast, his brows were
knit, his face was pale and haggard. A
young girl, of rare beauty, who was
leaning with both hands upon the table,
and gazing upon him with anxious tenderness,
said in a soft voice:</p>

<p>"Well, father, what shall I say to
this stranger, who wishes to speak with
you?"</p>

<p>"How does he look? what is his age?"
said Barati.</p>

<p>"He is a man of about sixty years;
his face is mild and majestic."</p>

<p>"It is not he!" said Barati, shaking
his head, "and still, Clemence, you say
that he has spoken of a date&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 60 col 2 -->

<p>"Yes, father," replied Clemence, "as
you gave orders that no one should be
admitted to you, this stranger asked to
speak with me.  'None of your domestics,'
he said to me, 'will announce my
visit to the councillor, under the pretext
that he is not at home. He is at home,
I know. He arrived from the mountain
at midnight. If he is asleep, awake
him, and tell him that one of those who
are in possession of the date of which he
was reminded at the castle of La Roque,
is very desirous to see him.' "</p>

<p>"One of those!" muttered Barati,
with a hollow voice. "There are many,
then, who know it!"</p>

<p>"And as I appeared to hesitate,"
resumed the young girl, he added: 'Do
not fear that your father will be angry
with you for disturbing his occupations
or his sleep; on the contrary he will be
pleased.' "</p>

<p>The councillor seemed disturbed by
the most violent agitation. He rose, and
cried, warmly:</p>

<p>"This man has deceived you, Clemence.
I have no time to receive any
one. I had scarcely arrived when I
found a letter from the parliament demanding
a report concerning the business
upon which I went to La Roque.
I cannot receive this stranger."</p>

<p>"I will tell him so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Add," said the councillor, rising
again, and walking back and forth in
agitation, "add that I know not what he
means by that date of which I was
reminded last night. I have heard
twenty different dates mentioned by intriguers
who would fain obtain admission
into a respectable house under the pretext
that they know&mdash;secrets.&mdash;In fine
this man&mdash;I will not see him!"</p>

<p>"I will carry him your answer,"
said Clemence, "but he will be greatly
grieved, for he seemed very desirous to
see you."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Barati, "I will not."</p>

<p>The young girl left the chamber, but
scarcely was the door closed when Barati
fell as if exhausted upon his chair, and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, while his teeth
chattered with rage, "twenty years of
honor, of courage, of sacrifices! nothing

<!-- page 61 col 1 -->

will have served me! and still it was
justice! and because I avenged my
wrongs, I shall be treated like a criminal?
and I find myself at the mercy of
a furious madman&mdash;what say I? of the
first comer! For this man who asks to
see me&mdash;who is he? what does he
know?"</p>

<p>Then rising suddenly, he opened the
door to recall Clemence, but it was too
late, she had already crossed the hall,
and he could hear her repeat accurately
the answer which he had directed her to
give the stranger.</p>

<p>The man uttered, an exclamation of
dissatisfaction, and said at last:</p>

<p>"Well, I will return in two hours,
and God grant that it be not too late
either for him or for me, if, indeed, I
am able to return. But fearing that I
might not find your father at home, I
have written this billet for him. Will
you place it in his hands?"</p>

<p>This circumstance restrained Barati,
who was upon the point of calling out
to this man that he was ready to listen
to him.</p>

<p>"This billet," he thought, "will tell
me what I have to fear, and it will not
appear as if I yielded to a threat."</p>

<p>Clemence took the billet, and the unknown
continued:</p>

<p>"Let him do exactly as is counselled
in this billet, let him do it to save
those who might have ruined him, and
yet have not done so."</p>

<p>Barati listened, endeavoring to recognise
the voice, which had a slightly
foreign accent, but it recalled no remembrance.</p>

<p>At the last words of the unknown,
Clemence uttered a faint cry of terror,
but the man at once added:</p>

<p>"As to you, fair maiden, who have been
so kind to a stranger, receive, I pray you,
this ring, and remember well what I
say to you; if, in the course of a few
days, perhaps to-day indeed, you are
thrown into such a position that you can
demand aid and protection from no
member of your family, repair to the
church of Saint Saturnin on Friday
evening at the hour of vespers, and extend
toward the altar the hand upon
which you wear this ring, saying in a
loud voice: 'Lord of Mercy, come to

<!-- page 61 col 2 -->

my aid!' There may be some one perhaps
who will hear you."</p>

<p>Clemence gazed at the ring, which
was very beautiful, and seemed to be of
great value, but she drew back her
hand as the stranger was about to place
it upon her finger.</p>

<p>"Keep your ring, sir," she said, "although
your age is such that I might
look upon this gift as a token of kind
liberality merely, yet I should appear
very thoughtless in your eyes, were I
to accept it, especially as I am the
daughter of a magistrate."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary to mention it to
your father, my child."</p>

<p>"I could not receive it, sir, without
mentioning it to him, and if I should he
would forbid me to accept it."</p>

<p>"Well then, my child," said the
stranger, "remember my words; do not
disdain them as you disdain my gift."</p>

<p>"Unless God summons my father
hence," said Clemence, "I shall always
find aid in him, for I shall always
endeavor to be worthy of it."</p>

<p>"It is right for each to put faith in
his virtue but none but a madman will
put faith in his fortune. Your father's
aid may fail you although God should
not summon him hence, and sooner than
you think, perhaps."</p>

<p>"You terrify me," said Clemence, with
an agitated voice, "do you know of any
danger which threatens my father?"</p>

<p>"Danger hangs over the head of
every mortal; that man is blind, who,
when he has reached the height of his
wishes, disdains the warnings which
might save him; but God, doubtless,
has decreed that it should be so, in order
that the day of justice may arrive for
the strongest as well as for the
craftiest."</p>

<p>"Your words, sir," said Clemence
with something of anger in her voice,
"your words, sir, although obscure, bear
a semblance of accusation against my
father. I neither can nor will hear
more."</p>

<p>"As you please, my child."</p>

<p>During this conversation, to which
Barati had listened with extreme anxiety,
he had been several times upon the
point of interrupting the interview, and directing
Clemence to admit the stranger;

<!-- page 62 col 1 -->

but to do this he must revoke his resolution,
and thus manifest a fear, which, in
the eyes of his daughter, would prove
the influence of that date of which he
pretended to be ignorant. To do this,
would show, also, that he had been listening
to their discourse, an act but little
in accordance with the dignity of a
magistrate. He waited, therefore, until
the unknown had taken his departure;
Clemence seemed very slow in placing
the billet in his hands, but as soon as he
received it, he gave orders that the
bearer should be admitted if he called
again, and dismissed his daughter, who,
with her eyes fixed upon him, stood
amazed at the agitation which, in
spite of all his efforts, was visible in
his features.</p>

<p>Barati turned pale before her gaze,
and with a violence which he had never
before manifested to his child, he said:</p>

<p>"Have you not heard me, Clemence?
Am I already a condemned man, that
my daughter refuses to obey me?"</p>

<p>Clemence, already disturbed by the
words of the stranger, was about to
speak, but a second command from her
father, uttered in a tone still more imperative,
compelled her to retire.</p>

<p>As soon as Barati was alone, he opened
the billet, in which he expected to find
an explanation of the stranger's errand,
but he was stupefied at seeing that it referred
to a subject which seemed entirely
foreign to the remembrance of the fatal
date which had been recalled to him.
The billet ran as follows:</p>

<p>"It is now five years since a casket
covered with shagreen, and ornamented
with gilt-headed nails, was placed in
your hands by a man to whom you
promised to restore it on demand, or if
he were unable to come and reclaim it
in person, to destroy it upon his writing
to you a sentence agreed upon between
you. This sentence is the following:</p>

<p>" '<i>Speech is silver, but silence is gold</i>.'</p>

<p>"Burn the casket on the instant, without
opening it. The moment has arrived."</p>

<p>Here the councillor paused, remained
motionless for an instant and
then continued to read:</p>

<p>"If you have kept your word the
casket will be found upon the upper

<!-- page 62 col 2 -->

shelf of your book-case. I remind you
of this circumstance if you have forgotten
it, because an hour lost in searching
after this treasure may ruin you, as
well as those who placed it in your
keeping, and forget not the date of the
20th of November!"</p>

<p>Barati crushed the billet in his hands;
a kind of senseless fury seized him at
the thought of being forced to obey this
command, without receiving the slightest
guarantee from those who held his
life and honor in their keeping. He
asked himself if it were not prudent for
him to inquire for his own defence into
the secret of those who possessed his
secret. He was interrupted in his reflections
by a loud knocking at the door
of his house.</p>

<p>Barati imagined that it was the stranger,
who had returned according to his promise,
and his face was lighted up with
joy. The next moment, however, the
pride which had prompted him to refuse
admission to this man, returned with all
its strength. To display the slightest
agitation at this fatal date, was to acknowledge
the crime which it recalled, and
this he would not have done amid the
most frightful tortures. His courage
rose again, a feeling of scorn took the
place of his indecision&mdash;he opened the bookcase,
not to take the casket, but to seize a
poignard, which he concealed beneath his
doublet, then returning to his seat at the
table, he arranged his papers, and with
inclined head, and pen in hand, like a
man deeply absorbed in thought, he
awaited the announcement of the stranger.
Notwithstanding this seeming indifference,
the warning of this man absorbed
him so exclusively, that he wrote down,
unconsciously, the fatal date: 20th November,
1683.</p>

<p>At this moment the door was thrown
open, and with a loud voice a herald exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The President de Fourvi&egrave;res!"</p>

<p>This visit, thus suddenly announced,
and announced in this manner, (for
it was only in cases where the
members of parliament visited a
house as judges on some serious errand,
that they were accompanied by a
herald, at whose approach every door
was opened, without time for warning),

<!-- page 63 col 1 -->

this visit, we say, thus announced and
at a moment when Barati expected one
so different, filled him with such surprise
and terror, that he started up, pale
and trembling like a culprit awaiting the
entrance of his judge.</p>

<p>The President de Fourvi&egrave;res, was
dressed in his robes of office. He was
a man of about fifty years, with a face
haughty and stern. Like Langlois, he
resembled a bird of prey, but in the
president this resemblance recalled the
vulture, while in the clerk it reminded
one of the raven.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment at the door,
and cast a hurried glance around the
cabinet of Barati, as if he expected to
surprise some one with him. He concealed
his wonder, however, at finding
the councillor alone, but he observed his
agitation, and gazed at him for a moment
with piercing eyes. This was enough
to put Barati on his guard; the entrance
of this man, whom he heartily detested,
and whom he knew to be his
bitter enemy, apprised him that he was
threatened with some imminent danger,
and the insulting loftiness of that glance
was a sufficient warning that this danger
had been brought upon him by M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res.</p>

<p>At this moment, in presence of this
man, who was his superior in office, but
whose limited abilities and unlimited licentiousness
were the objects of his profound
contempt, the councillor, although
ignorant of the point upon which he was
to be assailed, at once resumed that firmness
and energy of which he had given
proof in the castle of La Roque. He
returned with disdain the insulting salutation
which had been addressed to him.
By a sign, he directed the president to be
seated, resumed his place, and cast upon
him that cold and penetrating glance,
which had so often pierced the mysteries
which shrouded the darkest crimes. The
president was disturbed for a moment,
but strong in the superiority of his station,
and in the power with which his errand
invested him, he soon regained his
courage. Barati did not utter a word,
but waited for the president to address
him. The latter, who had imagined
that the councillor would inquire after
the motive of his visit, and who had already

<!-- page 63 col 2 -->

prepared his answer, was silent,
also, so that a momentary pause ensued,
which would have been ludicrous, had
not the features and mien of these two
men announced that an important interview
was about take place between
them.</p>

<p>At last, the president, seeing that Barati
had resolved not to break the silence,
began in these words:</p>

<p>"My visit surprises you, sir?"</p>

<p>"You cannot doubt it, M. de Fourvi&egrave;res."</p>

<p>"I am about to tell you its object."</p>

<p>"I am waiting to hear it."</p>

<p>"You returned last evening from the
castle of La Roque."</p>

<p>"Last night, sir, at two o'clock precisely."</p>

<p>"The chamber of inquest assembled
this morning at six, and you were not
present."</p>

<p>"The chamber of inquest has not ridden
thirty leagues in two days."</p>

<p>"In obedience to its orders, you were
to present your report immediately upon
your arrival."</p>

<p>Although not completely reassured
at finding the conversation turn upon
this subject, yet the councillor felt encouraged;
he divined, as he thought,
that the blow aimed at him by M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res had no connection with the
fears which disturbed him at the moment
when the magistrate entered the
apartment; and practising against him
the same tactics which he would have
employed against a stranger, that is to
say, the most consummate assurance
and disdain of every imputation, he
gazed upon the president with an air of
unspeakable haughtiness; his glance
seemed to penetrate to the very depths
of the truth which the latter appeared
inclined to conceal from him, and he replied:</p>

<p>"The chamber of inquest has taken
the precaution to render my report superfluous,
by appointing master Langlois
my associate in this affair; it has his
minutes in its hands, and has not waited
for my report."</p>

<p>The president seemed at first confounded;
but he soon regained his composure.</p>

<p>"That is a proof, sir, that a subordinate

<!-- page 64 col 1 -->

officer of the parliament has afforded
you an example of the manner in which
your duties should have been performed."</p>

<p>The glance that Barati fixed upon the
president, the smile which accompanied
this glance, and the tone in which he replied
to him, would have been the signal
for mortal combat between two men
of the sword; it but added venom to
the hate which existed between these
two gentlemen of the robe.</p>

<p>"Has the chamber of inquest read
the minutes of master Langlois?"</p>

<p>"I have read them, sir," replied M.
de Fourvi&egrave;res, sternly.</p>

<p>"Has the assembled chamber read
them?"</p>

<p>"It has read them, sir."</p>

<p>"And the chamber has found that I
have been negligent in my duty, and
that&mdash;and that your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, master
Langlois, has given me an example
which I ought to copy."</p>

<p>The president bit his lips, and replied,
with ill disguised anger:</p>

<p>"The chamber has been astonished&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has been astonished?" interrupted
Barati, repeating the words of M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, with a tone of doubt.</p>

<p>"The chamber has regretted that the
fatigues which you have undergone,
should have prevented you from appearing
before it at once, and as it is unwilling
to defer the punishment due to the
outrage which it has received in your
person, it has charged me to come and
inquire after the facts from your own
lips."</p>

<p>Barati, in his turn, found himself closely
pressed. Unwilling to endure the insulting
form which the president M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res would have given to the errand
with which he had been entrusted,
he had compelled him to clothe it with the
grave and becoming character, with
which such a step should be invested by
parliament; but he suddenly found himself
in a position which he knew to be
replete with danger, and which he would
fain have approached in his own fashion.
If the reader will recall the injunction
which Barati had received from the Baron
de la Roque, directing him to prevent the
parliament from taking measures against

<!-- page 64 col 2 -->

the old seigneur, and, above all, from
sending an officer to the castle, he will
readily understand the embarrassing nature
of this examination.</p>

<p>Barati had not doubted but that he
should be able to suppress this inquest,
but for this end he needed time for a separate
and private interview with each
of his colleagues in order to instruct
them, one by one, as to the result of his
visit to La Roque, in order to describe
the confinement to which he had been
subjected as an act of mere churlishness
and want of hospitality, and to persuade
them that except a slight show of resistance,
the bare appearance of a member
of the parliament, had at once rendered
the old man submissive and obedient.
In fact, now that the culprit had redressed
the grievances of the manufacturers,
and the latter had accepted payment
for the damages which they had
suffered, Barati, passing slightly over his
personal affronts, would easily have persuaded
his colleagues of the folly of
prosecuting a suit, in which there were
now no complaints. And he would doubtless
have succeeded in his project if he
had been the first to obtain a hearing,
but the report given in by Langlois
of the events which had occurred at
the castle, a proceeding contrary to all
established usage, seemed to render
this plan impracticable, and deprived
the counsellor of all hope of obeying the
injunction of those mysterious beings,
who had guaranteed the safety of the baron
and of Barati, upon the condition that
the parliament should not pursue its investigations
at the castle of La Roque. The
danger had thus assumed a new aspect.</p>

<p>Still the interrogatory was direct, and
a reply was necessary. The councillor
endeavored to evade it by an ordinary
subterfuge, that of accusing others.</p>

<p>"So then," he replied; with a haughty
tone, "the chamber of inquest esteems
itself sufficiently enlightened by the imperfect
minutes of one of its inferior officers!
and in virtue of such a document,
the chamber would take into its
hands the management of an affair
which it has entrusted to me."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," rejoined the president,
with the authority, not of the individual,
but of the superior in office, "pardon

<!-- page 65 col 1 -->

me, the parliament does not think
itself sufficiently enlightened, since it
has commissioned me to visit you for the
purpose of obtaining further information.
It does not wish to take into its hands
the management of an affair which it
has once placed in yours, since this affair
has been arranged to the satisfaction of
all parties. But parliament is unwilling
that its authority, its sovereignty, its
sanctity, should be compromised by the
culpable or self-interested indulgence of
one of its members."</p>

<p>"I imagined," said Barati, who could
scarcely control his anger, at finding
himself thus forced in his last entrenchment,
by a man who openly professed to
hate him; "I imagined that I had proved,"
he said, contemptuously, "that I am not
the man to allow the parliament to be insulted
in my person."</p>

<p>"It is true, sir, you spoke and acted
with becoming dignity on the evening
when you were conducted into the presence
of the Baron de la Roque; no one
can reproach you on this point, but you
have been subjected to personal violence,
which you were unable to resist, and
which must not remain unpunished."</p>

<p>"President de Fourvi&egrave;res," replied Barati,
"I see a wide difference between a
design formed by a man in the full possession
of his faculties to affront an august
assembly, and the burlesque farce
of a madman; and, for my part, I have
found no insult&mdash;"</p>

<p>The president gazed at Barati with an
air of scorn, and said:</p>

<p>"Ha! you have found no insult in
that which has occurred to you! It is
possible that there was none to you personally,
for, your duties as a magistrate
once finished, in your own judgment at
least, you had an interview, very amicable,
doubtless, with the baron, but the
parliament considers itself insulted&mdash;"</p>

<p>At these words Barati rose, and replied
gravely:</p>

<p>"M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, it is useless to
continue; I see in all this a formal accusation
against me; this procedure is a
far greater insult to me than any which
the parliament has received in my person.
I refuse, definitely, to answer any
further questions, and I shall await the

<!-- page 65 col 2 -->

accusation which has been entered
against me."</p>

<p>Barati hoped to end the discussion by
this formal declaration, but the president
replied with bitter irony:</p>

<p>"No accusation has been entered, sir;
on the contrary, the chamber acts with indulgence;
facts have come to the knowledge
of the parliament, but it is unwilling
to admit them as true, except so far as
they are confirmed by your evidence,
and knowing that your hasty journey
had prevented you from giving in your
report, it has commissioned me&mdash;I repeat
it&mdash;to visit you, and obtain the requisite
information. What can you find
insulting in this procedure?"</p>

<p>"M. de Fourvi&egrave;res," said the councillor,
turning his face to conceal his agitation,
"I will report to the chamber in
person, or in writing, as it may decide."</p>

<p>"Councillor Barati," said the president,
putting on his hat; "it has pleased
the chamber that you should report to
me at once."</p>

<p>Barati was stupefied. The question
now was whether he should place himself
in a state of open revolt against the
parliament, or acknowledge facts which
would necessarily lead to those measures
against the Baron de la Roque,
which he had been warned would tend
directly to his ruin, and the baron's.
If these measures were taken, was he not
menaced with the disclosure of that secret
which he thought buried in the
tomb, that secret of which he had been
reminded by the terrible date of the 20th
of November. He cast upon the president
one of those lowering glances,
which seem to seek a spot for the poignard;
his hand sought instinctively the
weapon which he had destined for another,
and he seemed so terrified at the emotion
which disturbed him that he withdrew
to a greater distance from his enemy.
He walked once or twice across
his cabinet, and after a few moments'
reflection, he subdued his pride, he subjected
his hate before the power which
menaced him, and replied with forced
deference:</p>

<p>"M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, as a magistrate I
am incapable of trampling upon the vanquished.
M. de la Roque has demeaned
himself most loyally, and the greater

<!-- page 66 col 1 -->

part of his fortune will be employed in
the payment of the sums offered by him,
and accepted by the complainants. In
addition to this humiliation, to this loss, a
domestic calamity has fallen upon him,
a calamity as severe as unexpected. I
was unwilling, I still am so, to add to
these misfortunes by a denunciation
which would complete the ruin of a man
endowed with many estimable qualities.
This is the cause of my silence, and it
is for this reason that I hesitate to add the
authority of my testimony to the facts
which have been disclosed to you."</p>

<p>"You acknowledge them to be facts,
then?"</p>

<p>"I am ignorant of what has been disclosed."</p>

<p>"Give in your evidence, and we will
then judge how far it agrees with the information,
of which we are already in
possession."</p>

<p>"And thus, sir," said Barati, who saw
that these measures were directed, rather
against himself than against the Baron
de la Roque, "and thus, sir, my word is
to be placed upon a level with the allegations
of a man like Master Langlois."</p>

<p>"I do not know what will be thought
of the value of these allegations, if you
declare them to be false; to judge of this,
it is necessary that you should answer."</p>

<p>Barati was for a moment a prey to one
of those transports of fury, which impel
a man to slay the enemy, who, holding
him in his power, sports with the helpless
rage which he inspires. He subdued
his emotion, however, and shrugged his
shoulders in silence. The president
continued, in an angry tone:</p>

<p>"Were you, or were you not, constrained
by force to enter the castle of
La Roque?"</p>

<p>"I went thither of my free will; I
proclaimed it aloud," said Barati, as he
walked back and forth in his cabinet.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, but was not this
an artifice to conceal the necessity in
which you were placed of obeying an
<i>armed injunction!</i>"</p>

<p>"Had I not thought it my duty to enter
the castle of La Roque, I would have
perished on the spot where I encountered
the armed emissaries of the baron, and
it required a formal and repeated order
from me to induce Master Langlois,

<!-- page 66 col 2 -->

who is a coward like all informers,
to follow me thither."</p>

<p>"You encountered armed men, then,
who directed you to repair to the castle?"</p>

<p>Barati could not control a gesture of
indignation at seeing the address with
which M. de Fourvi&egrave;res caught at a
word that had escaped him. The latter
remarked it, and added with an air of
irony:</p>

<p>"I gather as much from your words.
Then, were you not imprisoned and so
closely that the Baroness de la Roque
offered to assist you in making your escape,
an offer which you nobly refused,
in order to fulfil your duty to the last,
despite all the dangers to which it exposed
you?"</p>

<p>"In truth, sir," replied Barati endeavoring
to imitate the tone of raillery
in which the president addressed him,
"one would think that I had braved tortures,
the rack, death. Such is Master
Langlois' cowardice that he mistook a
ground chamber for a dungeon, a poor
bed for the straw of a criminal, and one
of the baron's lackeys for a headsman!"</p>

<p>"You do not answer me, sir," resumed
the president. "No one doubts of your
courage, or of the cowardice of Master
Langlois, but though you found nothing
terrifying in the ridiculous display of the
baron, this does not prove that it was not
his intent to terrify you. And, in truth,
sir, to judge from the pertinacity with
which you evade my questions, and seek
to mitigate facts which demand severe
rebuke, I should be almost tempted to believe
that he had succeeded."</p>

<p>The feeling which had induced Barati
to refuse admission to the stranger who
had presented himself in the morning,
was the shame of seeming to yield to a
menace. M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, in accusing
the councillor of being influenced by
fear in thus refusing to denounce M. de
la Roque, aroused again that rash susceptibility,
and forgetting that for the last
hour, he had been using all his exertions
to escape from the necessity of
confirming Langlois' accusation, Barati
replied hastily:</p>

<p>"President de Fourvi&egrave;res, I pitied the
Baron de la Roque, but I did not fear
him, neither do I fear him now! The
accusations which you bring against him

<!-- page 67 col 1 -->

are true, but I was unwilling on my part
to engage the parliament in an affair in
which the insult was so ridiculous, and
in which the reparation might be ridiculous
also. Do not expect from me then,
a report within the short time which you
require. No, sir, no, I will not give it.
I leave it to others to prosecute such
petty offences."</p>

<p>The President de Fourvi&egrave;res now
rose and said to Barati:</p>

<p>"Be assured, sir, the affair will be a
serious one, and more so than you imagine.
In the name of the parliament, I
declare you my prisoner!"</p>

<p>Barati started backward at this declaration,
and exclaimed with surprise and
alarm:</p>

<p>"Prisoner! I, sir, and for what crime?
under what pretext!"</p>

<p>"You can conjecture it, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am a member of the parliament,"
said Barati proudly, "of that parliament
which crushed in this city, the infamous
tribunal of the Inquisition, and
crushed it, (you would remember this,
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, if you knew the
chief claim of parliament to public
esteem), crushed it, I say, because when
those who were summoned before it,
desired to learn the crimes of which they
were accused, it was the usual reply of
that iniquitous tribunal that they could
be at no loss to conjecture them."</p>

<p>The president did not answer, and
Barati added:</p>

<p>"How much time will be allowed me
to arrange my affairs?"</p>

<p>"The parliament has not thought it
necessary," said M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, "to
allow you any time. The affairs of an
honest man are always arranged; those
only who have something to conceal
need the time which you demand. You
will immediately follow the officer who
waits in your antechamber; he will
accompany you in my carriage to the
Capitol."</p>

<p>All Barati's courage forsook him at
this stern command. He thought of
those supernatural beings in the castle
of La Roque, and of that mysterious
casket which he had been directed to
destroy. He believed himself lost, yet
without knowing how, and had the man
before him been any other than an implacable

<!-- page 67 col 2 -->

enemy, he would have stooped
to implore an hour's delay. But his
conviction of the uselessness of this step,
saved him from this display of weakness;
and he was about mechanically to obey
the order of the president, when Clemence,
who had been alarmed by the
singular words of the Unknown, by her
father's agitation, and by the arrival of
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, attended as he was
by a herald, entered the apartment, contrary
to her custom, without being summoned,
and said to the councillor:</p>

<p>"My father, I have just seen the
stranger who called here this morning;
he is a few steps from the house."</p>

<p>M. de Fourvi&egrave;res measured Clemence
with a stern glance, which he then directed
to Barati, as if to say, "Is it the
office of this young girl to announce her
father's visitors. Has curiosity prompted
this step, and is her father's supervision
so careless that she is thus ignorant of
the rules of good breeding?"</p>

<p>"I cannot admit this man, <i>I do not
know him</i>," said the councillor, with
marked emphasis upon the last words.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for your father to
admit any one," rejoined M. de Fourvi&egrave;res.
"Tell this to your domestics,
mademoiselle; it is their duly to reply
to visitors, as it is to announce them."</p>

<p>At this era, a young girl like Clemence,
was accustomed to receive with respect
a reproof from one older than herself
and the poor child bent her head and
cast her eyes to the ground; but she
was greatly astonished at her father's
silence, for he had directed her to announce
the stranger as soon as he made
his appearance.</p>

<p>Clemence was about to withdraw,
but at this moment, the officer who had
accompanied M. de Fourvi&egrave;res entered
the apartment.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">THE ARREST.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> officer who entered the apartment
was a handsome young man, of a
pleasing figure and careless air, and he
spoke in a tone almost of impertinence.</p>

<!-- page 68 col 1 -->

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> president," he said, "I advise
you to despatch matters; I do not
know how it has happened, but a crowd
of common people have collected before
the house, crying out that you are going
to arrest the councillor Barati, and that
they will not suffer it; they have already
commenced a show of rebellion,
by taking the horses from your coach,
and compelling the driver to lead them
home, so that we must wait for another
carriage, or conduct the prisoner on foot
through the streets of Toulouse."</p>

<p>The officer spoke as if he felt a kind
of pleasure in apprizing M. de Fourvi&egrave;res
of the danger which threatened
him.</p>

<p>"How is it, sir?" said the president,
angrily, "that the people have been informed
that I was here? how comes it
that they have collected together, and
that you have suffered it?"</p>

<p>"President de Fourvi&egrave;res," said the
officer, who was no other than M. D'Auterive,
the nephew of the Baron de la
Roque, in whose company the son of
Jean Couteau served as a private, "President
de Fourvi&egrave;res, I received an order
from my colonel to escort you to this
house, and I have done so with six soldiers
and a subaltern, without knowing
for what. If the populace have been
warned of your projects, it can only
have occurred from some indiscretion on
your part or that of your associate."</p>

<p>"That is true, sir," replied M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, "and it is strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced at Barati with a threatening
air. The latter, who hoped for a
chance of safety in this unexpected obstacle
to his immediate arrest, said with
a tone of scorn:</p>

<p>"Is this crime to be laid to my charge
also, and would you accuse me of having
excited a revolt against orders, of which
I was as ignorant as M. D'Auterive?"</p>

<p>The president turned his back upon
Barati, and, addressing the officer, he
said:</p>

<p>"And you are prepared to execute
these orders, I suppose, notwithstanding
the clamors of a few turbulent knaves?"</p>

<p>"President de Fourvi&egrave;res," replied
D'Auterive, with a respect blended with
much of that insolence, which a soldier
is ready to display toward a gownsman,

<!-- page 68 col 2 -->

"my colonel has placed me at your
orders for an affair, which, as he said,
was connected with the service of the
king. In obeying you I obey his majesty,
my master and yours, and if in the
fulfilment of my duty, it is necessary to
charge this populace, I am ready to do
so at the risk of my life and yours."</p>

<p>That our readers may understand
these words, we must inform them that
owing to one of the privileges of the city
of Toulouse, a royal garrison could not
be quartered within its walls without
the consent of parliament, and the regiments
once admitted into the city could
be expelled again by a decision of the
magistrates. In this state of things, we
can readily understand the want of sympathy
which existed between these officers
of the royal troops, and the gentlemen
of the robe or gownsmen, as they termed
them. This had reached such a point,
that if a revolt had broken out against
the parliament, in that which may be
called the sphere of its official authority,
the military force would have looked on
without interfering. An affair only which
concerned the royal service could induce
the commander of a regiment to place one
of his officers at the disposal of parliament.
On the other hand, the deeds
which had been recalled to Barati's remembrance
by the fatal date which had
produced such an impression upon him
at La Roque, and which had been invoked
to obtain the mysterious casket,
these deeds, we say, did not constitute a
crime against the king, a crime which
would have justified the employment of
one of his officers. The accusation in
question then, must be of a very different
nature, and as Barati was conscious of
no other crime, he drew fresh courage
from this circumstance, and although he
did not yet suspect the cause of his
arrest, he believed himself almost safe,
and turning to the officer, he said:</p>

<p>"Your interference is useless, sir; no
constraint is necessary to render me
submissive to the orders of parliament."
The officer seemed somewhat dissatisfied
to see a man disdain the honor of
being arrested by him, and he replied
dryly:</p>

<p>"Whether you consent or not, councillor
Barati, I must conduct you to the

<!-- page 69 col 1 -->

Capitol, for I have orders to do so. I will
lead you thither in person, or the rabble
assembled before this door must take
my life. But I ought not to expose this
gentleman," he added, pointing to the
president, "to those dangers which it is
my duty to brave, and I feel obliged to
warn him that among the groups which
are gathered about the house, they talk
of nothing less than strangling him. It
is true, all this is said in a low voice,
and with circumspection, yet their purpose
seems the more determined from its
very calmness, and I confess that with
but six men, I shall find it no easy task
to guard my prisoner, whom they have
resolved to rescue, and M. de Fourvi&egrave;res,
whom they have resolved to hang."</p>

<p>M. D'Auterive uttered the concluding
words in a tone of raillery, so insulting
to the president, whose courage was by
no means beyond suspicion, that Barati
listening solely to his hatred for M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, forgot the prudence required
by his situation and said:</p>

<p>"I think there is nothing to fear, gentlemen;
I venture to assure you that this
populace will be appeased by my voice."</p>

<p>"He who has excited the rebellion,
has doubtless the power to calm it," cried
the president, with the anger of a man
alarmed for his own safety.</p>

<p>"And how the d&mdash;&mdash;l," said the officer,
"could the councillor have thought
of aid from the populace when he did
not know that he was to be accused?
But some one better informed, has probably
taken thought for him," added
D'Auterive, glancing at Barati. "It is
now for you, worthy president, to conjecture
who thus betrays the secret of
your deliberations."</p>

<p>At this moment Barati thought of that
stranger to whom he had refused admission
into his presence, and whom his
daughter had seen in the neighborhood
of the house. Was it he who had collected
this crowd, which was every moment
increasing in numbers, but which
as yet had not uttered a shout? The
councillor suspected it. At the words
of the young officer the same thought
occurred to the president, and he said:</p>

<p>"Captain, I wish to question the stranger
of whom Mademoiselle Barati has
just spoken."</p>

<!-- page 69 col 2 -->

<p>The officer knit his brows, and answered
roughly:</p>

<p>"What stranger?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seemed that he was on his
way to this house when Mademoiselle
Barati came to announce his approach;
he must have presented himself at the
door."</p>

<p>"But the doors have been closed
against every one, according to your orders,"
replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is not far off. Let them
try to find him."</p>

<p>The features of Captain D'Auterive
assumed an air of vexation mingled with
impatience, and he exclaimed in an affected
tone:</p>

<p>"Pierre Couteau! Pierrou!"</p>

<p>"Here, captain!" replied a rough
voice, from the foot or the stair-case,
which led to the street door.</p>

<p>"Let the stranger be arrested, who
was to have called upon M. Barati, and
whose appearance mademoiselle has just
announced to her father, as the President
de Fourvi&egrave;res asserts."</p>

<p>This manner of commanding an arrest
brought a frown upon the president's
brow.</p>

<p>"No stranger has been here," replied
the voice.</p>

<p>"Try and find him," said the captain.</p>

<p>"What kind of a man is he?" asked
the soldier.</p>

<p>"What kind of a man is he?" said
the officer, turning to the president.</p>

<p>M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, although the question
was a very natural one, was unwilling
to endure the tone in which it was
addressed, and he replied:</p>

<p>"Captain, you forget that you are here
at my orders."</p>

<p>"I am so far from forgetting it, that I
demand of you the means to execute
them."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," resumed the president,
"what was the age, the appearance,
the dress of this man?"</p>

<p>Clemence hesitated to answer, and the
officer, by a stealthy sign, warned her to
be upon her guard. She replied:</p>

<p>"He was a man of about thirty years,
small, and had the appearance of a shop
keeper."</p>

<p>D'Auterive smiled, and this smile convinced
Barati that he was in some way

<!-- page 70 col 1 -->

connected with the stranger. The officer
repeated to Pierre Couteau the description
which had been given of the
unknown, and added with a slight accent
of mockery:</p>

<p>"Look for him, and find him, if you
can."</p>

<p>The soldier opened the street door,
and the crowd, which until now had been
so strangely silent, commenced shouting
and hooting. The officer turned pale,
but the flash of anger that darted from
his eyes proved that it was not fear which
produced the change. It was evident
that the young man expected the outbreak
which followed, and he was
pleased at the thought perhaps; but the
idea of seeing his uniform insulted by
the crowd which stood around the door
was too much for his patience, and he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"President de Fourvi&egrave;res, you have
directed my soldiers to leave this house;
they will not enter it again, for I am unwilling
that they should appear to fly
before this yelping rabble. Decide at
once what you will do, for I have no
other course left, except to make my
way through this crowd, sword in hand,
with you and your prisoner, if you will,
or without you, if you fear to follow me."</p>

<p>"Captain," replied the president,
"command your men to return. You
will be answerable to the parliament for
the safety of this prisoner, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And for yours, sir," interrupted the
captain. "Perhaps so, but I cannot win
the day, with you for my commanding
officer; and after all, I do not know what
ought to be the order of this battle.&mdash;Shall
we remain here, or go forth?"</p>

<p>At this moment the shouts were renewed
with increased violence, the street
door was thrown open, the soldiers were
forced back into the hall, and cries of
"Down with the parliament!" were
heard. M. de Fourvi&egrave;res started backward
in affright, and Barati said:</p>

<p>"Prisoner or not, sir, I am still a magistrate,
and since you are without the
courage to repel these insults, I will
prove to you that I know how to defend
the dignity of that parliament whose
honor you accuse me of compromising."</p>

<p>He walked at once toward the platform,
which overlooked the stair-case, at

<!-- page 70 col 2 -->

the foot of which a number of people
were crowded together, whose efforts to
make their way into the house were with
difficulty restrained by the few soldiers
who resisted them.</p>

<p>"Who dares, in my house, to cry
'Down with the parliament!' " said the
councillor, in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>Frenzied shouts of "Long live Barati!
Down with the parliament!" interrupted
him. Still, the feature in this strange
scene which most surprised Barati, was
the unexpected popularity which protected
him. Up to this hour he had endeavored
to pass for an austere and
upright magistrate, but he had never
sought to gain the favor of the populace.
These cries of "Long live Barati!" this
crowd, which braved the orders of the
parliament and the muskets of the soldiers,
surprised and bewildered him.&mdash;The
thought that his merit had gained
him the love of his fellow citizens, which
was thus suddenly displayed, took complete
possession of his mind. For a moment
he believed himself the master of
this crowd that shouted before his door,
and after having obtained silence, he
continued with a deliberate accent:</p>

<p>"Fear nothing on my account, worthy
inhabitants of Toulouse. Whatever accusation
may be brought against him
whom you have hastened hither to defend,
I shall be able to disprove it. Repair
to the parliament, follow me, I shall
appear there, supported by your acclamations,
and my enemies will regret their
imputations."</p>

<p>Barati did not observe the laughter
with which his address had been received,
and having finished it, he descended
some steps of the stair-case, and then
turning his head, he said in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Come, President de Fourvi&egrave;res, I
will answer for your safety!"</p>

<p>The president, notwithstanding his
alarm, could not resist this direct appeal,
and he advanced in his turn upon the
platform of the stair-case, accompanied
by the officer, who did not manifest the
slightest indignation at what was passing
before him.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the president made his
appearance, when the hootings of the
crowd were renewed with fearful violence.
Their enthusiasm for Barati

<!-- page 71 col 1 -->

had been somewhat equivocal in its character,
but their rage against M. de Fourvi&egrave;res
could not be mistaken. One could
remark, however, that it seemed to be
excited by several men of an air and
mien above the common rank, who made
their way amid the most furious, and, but
for the loud and constant clamor, the
sound of pieces of money could have
been heard upon the pavement of the
lower hall, as they slipped from the
hands which were held out to receive
them.</p>

<p>The president would have spoken, but
his words were drowned by the most
violent cries. Barati, in his turn, tried
to obtain silence, but his voice could not
rise above the tumult, his gestures could
not appease it. Suddenly, three or four
men threw aside the long cloaks which
covered them, and appeared, dressed in
the livery of the president. He did not
recognise them as his domestics, however,
for he commanded the soldiers to
arrest those wretches, but whether they
had not heard, or had misunderstood him,
these lackeys, armed with enormous
sticks, forced their way through the line
of soldiers at the foot of the stairs, and
ascended two or three steps. A struggle
now took place upon the stairs. Barati
was about to resist the assault, but he
stopped, and uttered a fearful cry at the
sight of a man who said to him in a low
voice, "20th November, 1683," and
then passed on, after having rudely thrust
him aside.</p>

<p>It was the same man who had
brought him a taper at the castle of La
Roque.</p>

<p>At this moment the assailants came in
contact with M. de Fourvi&egrave;res. The
president would have withdrawn into
the apartment, but the door had been fastened
by the man who had dashed Barati
aside, and who had entered the chamber
unperceived even by D'Auterive; the
latter had beckoned Clemence into a
small corridor, contiguous to the stair-case,
where he said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"On the upper shelf of your father's
book-case there is a casket which contains
papers that may ruin him. Remove
it. Some one will demand it again
at the proper time and place."</p>

<p>These words were drowned by the

<!-- page 71 col 2 -->

cries of "Long live Barati!" cries which
formed a strange contrast with the brutal
manner in which he had been thrust
aside.</p>

<p>"I have seen this casket," said Clemence.
"Be at ease."</p>

<p>She then tried to enter the apartment,
but finding the principal door locked
against her, she was obliged to have recourse
to a private stairway to reach
her father's cabinet. This circumstance,
to which she attached no importance,
cost her a few moments of time, which
were taken advantage of, doubtless, by
the man who had entered before her.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the assailants had
seized M. de Fourvi&egrave;res; they raised
him in their arms, carried him down the
staircase, and bore him to a carriage
which stood before the door; they thrust
him in, and entered it with him, without
the slightest opposition from those
around; then, amid shouts, and violent
tumult, the door of the carriage was
closed upon him, and starting off it made
its way through the crowd, and soon
disappeared around a neighboring corner.</p>

<p>No sooner had this occurred than M.
D'Auterive approached Barati, and said
in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, you can accompany me to
the parliament without fear."</p>

<p>But the councillor seemed no longer
to see or hear what was passing around
him.</p>

<p>At this moment, a man whom D'Auterive
recognised as an inn-keeper,
whose house had served as the rendezvous
of many an intrigue, ascended the
stairs in haste, and whispered some
words in the officer's ear, to which the
latter seemed to listen with extreme
surprise. He allowed him to pass, however,
and saw him hurry onward with the
air of a man perfectly acquainted with
the localities of the dwelling. His progress
was arrested by the door which
had been locked on the inside, and he
also turned aside to the private stair-case
which Clemence had ascended a moment
before.</p>

<p>The officer now left the house; in
escorting his prisoner he took various
precautions which he had neglected for
the protection of M. de Fourvi&egrave;res.

<!-- page 72 col 1 -->

He ordered his men to shoulder their
muskets, and placed himself at their
head, sword in hand. One would have
said that the soul and spirit of this revolt
had disappeared with the men who
had carried of M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, the
crowd fell back, and Barati, led by two
soldiers, was obliged to leave his house,
and traverse a part of the city on foot,
escorted by a band of armed men, like
the meanest criminal, and still not a cry,
not the slightest token of sympathy broke
from the crowd which followed him,
and which a moment before had shouted
so loudly, "Long live Barati!"</p>

<p>The councillor remarked this singular
change. He wished to question the
officer concerning it, but the latter kept
at a distance from him.</p>

<p>The train advanced amid a crowd of
people, which at every step grew more
and more numerous, each one inquiring
the cause of this extraordinary commotion.
The news spread by degrees, and
before an hour had passed the whole
city of Toulouse was informed that a
councillor of the parliament had been
arrested in his house, an event that occasioned
no little surprise.</p>

<p>The progress of the soldiers was slow,
for they were unwilling to manifest the
slightest fear of the populace, and it
was not until an hour had elapsed that
D'Auterive reached the Capitol with his
prisoner. He was immediately admitted
before the assembled chamber,
which appeared to have remained in
session to await the execution of its
orders.</p>

<p>In the presence of the chamber,
M. D'Auterive preserved that air of
respectful raillery which he had displayed
toward M. de Fourvi&egrave;res. He
related, how while he was awaiting the
orders of the president, a crowd had
assembled before the dwelling of the
councillor; how Barati had harangued
them to appease their fury, and how M.
de Fourvi&egrave;res, trembling with fear, had
thought it best to leave the house under
the protection of half-a-dozen of his
lackeys, whom he had summoned to his
assistance. D'Auterive added, that he
had not on this account considered himself
discharged from the duty which
had been entrusted to him, namely, that

<!-- page 72 col 2 -->

of arresting Barati; that consequently
he had escorted him to the Capitol, and
now consigned him into the hands of
the parliament.</p>

<p>One of councillors, the Comte de
Belissane, knit his brows, and said, in a
tone of suspicion to the officer:</p>

<p>"We will await the arrival of M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, to learn if the facts have
occurred precisely according to this
statement. The officer and the soldiers
who escorted our president, have but ill
defended him against the populace, since
he has been obliged to resort for assistance
to his lackeys."</p>

<p>"Was it my duty, sir," said D'Auterive,
haughtily, "to seize M. de Fourvi&egrave;res,
and to compel him to march side
by side with the prisoner? None but
his own domestics have approached him,
and if I allowed them to interfere, it was
only because I saw, as I imagined, that the
president preferred their protection to
mine. For the rest," added D'Auterive,
"I have saved the parliament from a humiliation
in allowing M. de Fourvi&egrave;res to
make his escape, as his alarm almost robbed
him of his senses, and afforded the
populace a spectacle of which I was
willing to deprive them."</p>

<p>"Captain," said the councillor, "M.
de Fourvi&egrave;res will give us an account
of your conduct, and we shall render
an account of it to your colonel."</p>

<p>"As you please, sir," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>He was about to retire when the president
entered the hall. He was deadly
pale; and his air was like that of a man
who had just escaped from some terrible
danger. His appearance disturbed M.
D'Auterive, and a glance which he exchanged
with the councillor who had
reproved him, did not seem to reassure
the young officer, for the Comte de
Belissane now appeared deeply agitated.
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res slowly ascended his
seat. All present gazed at him with
anxious curiosity, such was the air of
dismay which was visible in his features.
He saluted the assembly, and spoke in
the following words:</p>

<p>"In the first place, gentlemen, I must
thank M. D'Auterive for the courage
with which he has executed the orders I
gave him. He has not only succeeded
in bringing away his prisoner, but it

<!-- page 73 col 1 -->

was owing to his aid that I was able
to reach my carriage, and thus escaped
the menaces of those assassins who
surrounded me.</p>

<p>This was saying more in D'Auterive's
favor than he had ventured to say
for himself, and the councillor who had
appeared to suspect the conduct of the
officer hastened to reply:</p>

<p>"The modesty of M. D'Auterive has
been so great, that it has led me to be
unjust toward him. I feared for a moment
that he had not properly fulfilled
his duty. I offer him my sincere excuses."</p>

<p>D'Auterive smiled, bowed, and
then requested permission to withdraw,
which was at once granted to him.
The doors of the tribunal were then
closed, and Barati remained alone in the
presence of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Scarcely had D'Auterive left the Capitol,
when he returned to his dwelling,
and having exchanged his uniform for
the simple garb of a student of the university,
he sallied forth by a door which
opened upon an almost deserted street;
he walked onward until he reached its
extremity; he then knocked at the door
of a small dwelling which was opened
apparently by some unseen hand. D'Auterive
entered in haste, shut the door
behind him, and ascended a narrow,
gloomy stairway. A second door was
thrown open as if by magic, to receive
him, and he found himself in an apartment
in which five men were assembled,
one of whom was about sixty years of
age; the others were younger. One of
these still wore the dress of the lacqueys
who had carried off the president. No
sooner had D'Auterive entered than he
exclaimed hastily:</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>, gentlemen, you manage
matters strangely. You commission me
to carry off the president and to get him
out of the way, and then you set him
at liberty. If I and Belissane had been
wanting in coolness, we had all been lost."</p>

<p>"We set the president at liberty," replied
the old man, "but not until we had
pulled out his teeth. He cannot bite
now, and if he tries to bark, it will be in
vain, for the papers which could ruin us
all, must have been removed from Barati's
before this."</p>

<!-- page 73 col 2 -->

<p>The chevalier appeared strangely surprised
at these words. But whether it
were that he had been guilty of rashness
in charging Clemence to remove the
casket, or whether he wished to be the
sole master of this singular association,
of which he seemed to be a member, he
made no observations upon this point, and
replied with a smile:</p>

<p>"This poor councillor would be sadly
at a loss to understand why he is at the
same time, the object of the accusations of
the parliament, and of our secret protection."</p>

<p>"Without doubt," replied the old man,
sternly, "but we are still more at a less to
know who it is that has informed against
our association to M. de Fourvi&egrave;res.
Could you not furnish us with some information
on this subject?"</p>

<p>"I?" said D'Auterive, "where do
you imagine that I could have obtained
it?"</p>

<p>"Refresh your memory, and perhaps
you will discover."</p>

<p>D'Auterive started backward, and
striking his forehead, exclaimed with
frank simplicity:</p>

<p>"Death and hell! Marietta has blabbed!"</p>

<p>"He confesses it," said the man who
was dressed as a lackey, in a rough tone.</p>

<p>The old man turned toward the
speaker with a kind of deference, and
replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, he confesses it, and the manner
in which he does so, is a proof that he
has revealed our secret from heedlessness
rather than from treachery."</p>

<p>"What matters it? the time is short,
the parliament is warned, and the fruit
of twenty years' labor will be destroyed."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the old man, "M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res will keep the promise which
he has given us, and as he has been the
author of this strange investigation, his
proposition will obtain the assent of the
chamber. On the other hand Belissane
is too intelligent not to guess the source
from whence it springs, and he will do
all in his power to induce the chamber
to adopt it. We have all the time, then,
that we require to make a diversion."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that!" said
D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"I mean," replied the old man, "that

<!-- page 74 col 1 -->

you will probably be entrusted by parliament
with the search which it purposes
to aet on foot in the castle of La Roque,
and you can conceive, I think, that if
this is so, you can mitigate, if not efface,
the mischief caused by your indiscretion."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said D'Auterive, "I
must confess that it will be very difficult
to repeat the farce which we have
played to-day. Besides, I had Pierre
Couteau to back me this morning, and
may the devil seize me, if I comprehend
how he has prevented our men from
arresting the most furious among you,
when you bellowed so at the foot of the
stairs, and when you ascended to seize
the president, but once at the castle
of La Roque, neither he nor I will be
able to restrain our brave fellows, who
will be eager to reap their reward, for
the parliament will not fail to promise a
large share of the booty to the men
whom it sends on this errand. For my
part, I prefer to lose my portion, rather
than incur the risk of being hung like a
felon in endeavoring to save it."</p>

<p>"Chevalier D'Auterive," said the old
man who had first questioned him,
"three years ago when you penetrated
into our concealment in seeking to discover
the nocturnal meetings of Madame
de la Roque and Don Jos&eacute;, it was I who
turned aside the blade which was drawn
to despatch you; it was I who proposed
to you to become one of us, and confided
in your word as a man of honor; I then
informed you of the conditions of our
association: 'death follows the slightest
indiscretion!' "</p>

<p>"It is true, sir," said the chevalier,
"it is true, I am at your mercy; punish
me, if you will; I have broken my
pledge, my life is yours!"</p>

<p>"And we must finish with him," said
the man in the garb of a lackey, casting
a lowering glance upon D'Auterive, and
making a significant gesture to his comrades,
who pressed hurriedly around the
young man!</p>

<p>"Forbear!" cried the old man, "the
punishment of M. D'Auterive must not
occupy us now. Forget not, that, to-day
any extraordinary event (and the chevalier's
disappearance would be one),
would inevitably excite the attention of

<!-- page 74 col 2 -->

parliament. Let us wait until matters
take a decided turn. In fact, gentlemen,
in supposing that troops will be despatched
to the castle of La Roque, I have
stated the case in the most unfavorable
point of view. It is likely from the
manner in which M. de Fourvi&egrave;res will
speak of it that the accusation will be
withdrawn."</p>

<p>"The parliament is upon the track of
our association," replied the man in the
dress of a lackey. "They are a lynx-eyed
race, those gentlemen of the Robe;
they will not leave the track until they
have followed it to the end. I would
give a million to know what is now passing
in the chamber of inquest."</p>

<p>"We shall be informed of all by Belissane,
as soon as the sitting is ended,"
said the old man.</p>

<p>"That is, if Belissane is not suspected
and arrested in open session. These
gentlemen of the parliament have expelled
the inquisition from Toulouse, but
they have inherited its forms and secrecy.
You will ruin us with your delays,
comte."</p>

<p>It was the old man who was addressed
by this title, and it was the pretended
lackey who thus accosted him:</p>

<p>"I have summoned M. D'Auterive,
that he may inform us how much of the
truth has escaped his lips, in order that
we may know what is best to be done."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> gentlemen," said D'Auterive,
half laughing, half in vexation:
"thus it is. You know Mariette Langlois&mdash;she
is the prettiest maiden in Toulouse.
That she is the daughter of old
Langlois, the ugliest and clumsiest ape
in Christendom, I do not believe. He
has stolen the pretty child from some
noble family, that is certain."</p>

<p>"Proceed, sir, proceed," interrupted
the comte, "all this is idle."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, about two months
ago I fell in love with Mariette, and I
said to myself that the gayest gallant in
the city ought to be favored by the most
beautiful maiden."</p>

<p>The comte assumed an air of sternness,
and said, shaking his head:</p>

<p>"You should have been contented
with the most noble, and the most&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What mean you, sir?" cried the
chevalier, turning pale.</p>

<!-- page 75 col 1 -->

<p>"All shall be explained to you in due
time and place. Proceed!"</p>

<p>D'Auterive started backward and replied:</p>

<p>"Not until I know the meaning of the
words you have just addressed to me."</p>

<p>"They mean, sir," replied the man
in the garb of a lackey, "to warn you
that not one of those who belong to us
has a secret of which we are ignorant,
and he is thus bound to us by every possible
tie, if his oath alone is not sufficient
to restrain him. We are acquainted
with these petty amours, like this of
yours with Mariette, but that of which
we need to be informed exactly, is what
you said three days ago, when you met
her by appointment, after leaving vespers,
and while you walked with her
until nine o'clock upon the ramparts of
the gate of Montauban."</p>

<p>"<i>Peste</i>, gentlemen! you are better
acquainted with a man's affairs than he
is himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we are not acquainted with
the words, although we are with the actions."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, the words were
these: As I made Mariette the offer of
my heart, and fortune, she replied in
mockery, that if she had been rightly
informed, I promised beyond my ability
to perform. I was unwilling to have
the lie thrown thus in my teeth, and I
told her that if she had need of five hundred
louis, I would bring them to her
within the hour.</p>

<p>" 'You!' she cried, 'the five hundred
louis would be forgotten on the
way. Besides,' she added, 'you would
do better to pay the thousand livres that
you lost last evening at the house of the
Duke &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>" 'They are paid, my beauty,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'And you have five hundred louis
left?"</p>

<p>" 'Twice that.'</p>

<p>" 'You have a mine of gold at your
disposal, then?"</p>

<p>" 'Almost,' I said, laughing.</p>

<p>"And in what country is it situated?"
she resumed, in the same tone.</p>

<p>" 'In Peru.'</p>

<p>" 'Or, <i>almost</i>,' she said.</p>

<p>"The manner in which she uttered
those words, startled me.</p>

<!-- page 75 col 2 -->

<p>" 'Wherever it is,' I replied, 'matters
little, provided that the five hundred louis
reach you.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, then,' she said, 'I will expect
them.'</p>

<p>I returned home, provided myself with
the money, and went at once to Mariette's.
A supper had been prepared, and
I must own that I was astonished at the
freedom with which this maiden entertained
a lover in her father's house."</p>

<p>"A lover!" said the pretended lackey,
with a sneer, "you are trifling with us,
chevalier! Tell the simple truth, if you
please; it is a matter of life or death.
You went thither, you supped, you drank
much, and you prated more."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardeiu!</i>" cried D'Auterive, "it is
probable, then, that you know what I said
better than I do myself."</p>

<p>"You said, when you heaped promise
upon promise, to soften the beautiful Mariette,
that she had but to wish, and you
knew of a certain castle where taffetas,
laces and diamonds were manufactured,
and where all was at your disposal, and
when she laughed at the existence of this
marvellous castle, you told her that it
was the castle of La Roque"</p>

<p>"It is true," said D'Auterive, "and
heaven only knows what made me prate
thus, for after the third glass of wine I
was completely bewildered."</p>

<p>"And at the sixth, you slept like a
log upon the sofa," said the one who
was addressed by the title of comte.</p>

<p>"It was treachery, then?" said the
chevalier.</p>

<p>"Without doubt," replied the comte,
"and that proves," he added, turning to
the pretended lackey, "that information
had been given from some other quarter.
The meeting with Mariette was a thing
arranged. They wished to confirm suspicions
which were already excited."</p>

<p>"But how is it that these suspicions
were directed towards the chevalier?"
said the false lackey.</p>

<p>"As they were directed towards Barati,"
replied the comte, "from seeing
the one make purchases of lands, and
the other live beyond his acknowledged
resources. As concerns Barati, however,
they are mistaken; his unknown
fortune does not come from our workshop."</p>

<!-- page 76 col 1 -->

<p>"May the devil confound me!" rejoined
the chevalier, "if all this does not
appear to me like a game of blind man's
buff? How happens it, I pray you,
gentlemen, that if the parliament suspects
Barati, it has sent him to La
Roque, to discover what is passing
there."</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the false
lackey, "for I see that your indiscretion
has betrayed yourself alone, and that our
affair had already been disclosed."</p>

<p>"It is useless," said the comte, "the
chevalier need not know more. Now
that the papers are doubtless in our
possession, the councillor may fare as
God pleases. As to you, M. D'Auterive,
here are three thousand louis; ten
thousand more will be placed in your
hands within a week, if it is possible, and
public rumor will inform you if it is so.&mdash;Conceal
your money for a while. Happily
for you, you have a vice which will
prove your best defence, and the chances
of play will explain your extravagances.
Besides, the protection of the duchess
will suffice to save you. It is time to
separate. Had you been treacherous,
you would not leave this house alive.
You have been heedless only: you are
pardoned. But forget not that you belong
to us still, and that our motto is always
true: '<i>Speech is silver, but silence
is gold!</i>' "</p>

<p>To these words, of themselves sufficiently
explicit, the comte added a
glance which was still more so, and
which would have terrified a man less
intrepid than the young officer. He
took the three thousand louis, and went
from the house without remarking that
one of the silent actors in this scene had
left it a moment before him, at an almost
imperceptible sign from the man who
was dressed as a lackey.</p>

<p>D'Auterive had not proceeded twenty
paces, when a man of lofty stature, who
did not appear to see him, came rudely
in contact with him. The collision
was so violent that it completely stupefied
the chevalier; he would  have assaulted
the ruffian who had jostled him,
and whose mien was familiar to him,
but the man was now at a good distance.
D'Auterive then felt that he had received
a wound in the breast. He put his hand

<!-- page 76 col 2 -->

to the place, and withdrew it covered with
blood. Enraged at this public assault, he
would have pursued the man, who had
doubtless been suborned to assassinate
him. But he had scarcely proceeded
thirty paces when he fell to the ground.
Still, as he fell, he could see some one
approach him, gaze upon him as he lay
stretched upon the earth, and he heard
him mutter, "The deed is done! I was
warned of it."</p>

<p>At the same instant D'Auterive lost
all consciousness.</p>

<p>As this accident happened in a retired
part of the city, it is probable that the
young officer remained for some time unobserved
where he had fallen; he was
aroused from his swoon by the sound of
voices. He felt himself lifted up, and
carried in the arms of these persons,
and while in this state of stupor he could
distinguish the cry of "Fire! fire!"
which resounded from one street to
the other. Upon opening his eyes, he
saw the house which he had just left
wrapped in flames. From the sudden
violence of the conflagration it seemed
certain, not only that the fire had been
kindled intentionally but that every
thing had been arranged to cause it to
spread with a fury and rapidity likely to
render all efforts to extinguish it entirely
useless.</p>

<p>These cries, this tumult, this thought
passed before him like a dream; then
he fell back into a swoon again.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE DUCHESS DE NEVERS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> D'Auterive returned
to himself, he recognised the apartment in
which he lay, a <i>boudoir</i>, into which he
had been often admitted, and which
formed part of a small house which was
situated not far from the spot where he
had been wounded. A female whom he
also knew, was sitting at the foot of his
bed.</p>

<p>"How did I come here?" he said,
gazing around, to assure himself that he
was not deceived.</p>

<p>"Hush! M. D'Auterive," said the female.

<!-- page 77 col 1 -->

"For your health's sake, do not
exert yourself to speak. And believe
me," she added, in a low voice, "if you
do not wish the work completed, which
was begun by the man who struck you
to the ground a few hours ago, feign to
be in the agonies of death. Woman's
pity, and above all, the pity of her grace,
the duchess, is of a capricious nature;
although, notwithstanding her anger at
his infidelities, she might be terrified at
the sight of her lover's blood, when he
lay stretched in the street, forsaken by
all; yet, if she find him safe and sound,
and disposed to play the gallant, she
might easily suffer certain people to rid
her of so indiscreet a lover."</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> my pretty Rosine," said
the chevalier, "I think it will be unnecessary
for your mistress to make a second
trial, for to judge from something of
the same sort, which I received from a
Spanish gentleman, I believe my business
is done. Be a good girl, then, and a
good Christian; give me a little paper
and ink, that I may put my affairs in order,
and fetch me a priest to do the same
for my conscience."</p>

<p>"Silence! silence, sir! I am directed
to warn those who are here, as soon as
you give the slightest signs of life, and
there is a man among them who does
not look as if he were disposed to afford
you the benefit of clergy, any more than
that of the faculty."</p>

<p>"You can at least tell me how I was
brought here."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon dieu!</i> nothing is more simple.
Her grace, the duchess, as she
entered here by stealth, saw you as you
lay stretched upon the ground, and you
looked so pale, so deathlike, that it
touched her heart, and she sent me to
have you taken up, and carried into my
house. From thence, you were borne
through the little gate at the foot of the
garden, and so to this house, which, as
you know, is thought to be uninhabited."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said D'Auterive, raising
himself with difficulty upon his bed,
"the duchess came, then, to your house,
Rosine, to the inn-keeper's wife, who is
so skilful in weaving the chains of love.
Yet she had no appointment there with
me. She came then, for another!"</p>

<p>The female to whom this question was

<!-- page 77 col 2 -->

directed, appeared greatly embarrassed,
and replied:</p>

<p>"M. D'Auterive, a woman like her
grace, the duchess, has more than one
mystery to conceal. Be silent, and do
not question me. But I repeat it, do not
bear yourself proudly, nor seem to brave
her; I have never seen her in such a
state."</p>

<p>As Rosine uttered these words, a woman
of about thirty-eight years of age,
of a magnificent figure, commanding
beauty, and features haughty and passionate,
half opened the door, and said,
in an anxious tone:</p>

<p>"Well, have his senses returned?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, madam," replied Rosine.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said D'Auterive, raising
his voice, "and he is very desirous of
leaving this place, if he is to leave it, or
to have the matter ended, if he is to remain."</p>

<p>The lady whom D'Auterive thus addressed,
advanced to the bedside, and
made a sign to Rosine. The latter left
the chamber, and the Duchess de Nevers
remained alone with the chevalier:</p>

<p>"Gaston," she said, taking a seat in
front of him, "you have basely deceived
me!"</p>

<p>"I asked for a confessor, a moment
since, Leonore," said D'Auterive, "and
I do not see that they are disposed to
grant me one. I will confess to you,
then, and I pray you to repeat my confession
to a priest, who will absolve me
by posthumous grace, I hope."</p>

<p>"You jest, D'Auterive, but you do
wrong; that which I have to say to you
is serious, more serious than you think,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"What is there then, more serious than
death, of which I am thinking at this moment,
as you see?"</p>

<p>"You will not die of your wound,
Gaston; the surgeon who dressed it has
declared that it is not dangerous."</p>

<p>"And am I to think this good news
that you bring me, Leonore?" said
D'Auterive, unable to disguise his satisfaction
at what he heard.</p>

<p>"The news will prove as you please
to have it. That depends upon the answers
you give me."</p>

<p>"And as my answers will be according

<!-- page 78 col 1 -->

to your questions, I think you ought
to know whether it is good or evil."</p>

<p>"Gaston," resumed the duchess, "you
hold in your hands my honor, my life,
and perhaps the honor and the lives of
twenty of the most illustrious families in
France."</p>

<p>"As to your honor, Leonore, I know
that it is in my hands, and it would be
safe there, but for the existence of a
band of sorcerers, who know all that
happens, and who seemed to allude, not
long since, to a secret that I believed unknown
to the whole world."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, Gaston; I
was in that house when they questioned
you; I heard the reproaches that were
made to you."</p>

<p>"In that case, you know as much as I
do, Leonore, of all my infidelities. As
for myself, I wish to learn to whom I am
indebted for the poignard stroke which
struck me to the earth."</p>

<p>"Gaston," replied the Duchess de Nevers,
"you deserved death for having
betrayed the secret of those men, who,
for many years, have furnished you with
more money than would have enriched a
prince. Still, they were willing to pardon
you, but there was one of the number,
who feared lest he who thus heedlessly
divulged the secret of his fortune,
might as heedlessly betray the secret
of his love, and this one has directed
that the law should be meted out to you."</p>

<p>"The law!" said D'Auterive, with
savage scorn, "that is to say, six inches
of steel. I think I can divine the charitable
soul who has so justly condemned
me. Thanks, Leonore."</p>

<p>"D'Auterive! D'Auterive!" replied
the duchess, disdainfully, "this blow, had
it come from my hand, would have been
inflicted justly, but another has undertaken
to avenge me."</p>

<p>"A successor!" said the chevalier.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gaston!" cried the duchess,
with an expression of alarm, "we are
upon the brink of a precipice! D'Auterive,
you do not comprehend, then, that
all is discovered?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> Leonore," said the chevalier,
"since this morning, I have lived
in a world of illusions, of mystery, of
folly, of which I comprehend nothing.
I answer you as if I found no cause for

<!-- page 78 col 2 -->

surprise in what you have just told me.
And still you were in that house when
they questioned me, and when some one
condemned me to undergo the law of this
mysterious society, into which I was enrolled
in my own despite. Are you a
member of it, then?"</p>

<p>"If you had listened to me more attentively,
D'Auterive," said the duchess,
while a blush covered her cheeks, "you
would have heard me tell you, that you
hold in your hands, not only my honor,
but that of more than twenty of the noblest
families in France."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember," said the
chevalier, turning pale, "I remember
that you said something of that sort, but&mdash;I
confess&mdash;all this seems so confus&mdash;"</p>

<p>He breathed a heavy sigh, his eyes
closed, and he murmured:</p>

<p>"I told you truly, Leonore, that your
last message of love was mortal!"</p>

<p>"Gaston! Gaston!" cried the duchess,
bending over him.</p>

<p>He had fallen, again, into a swoon.&mdash;She
called, and Rosine entered. Three
men followed her; the one in the garb
of a lackey, he who had been addressed
by the title of comte, and a third, who was
clothed entirely in black. The latter
was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you learned?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. You see!" said the duchess,
with an expression of mingled grief
and anger.</p>

<p>The man in black approached the bed,
and having felt the chevalier's pulse, he
shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I told you that it was possible to save
him, but only if he were left completely
undisturbed. His wound does not seem
to be serious, but he has been so greatly
agitated, that he may die in one of these
swoons."</p>

<p>"What matters a moment of repose
for one condemned! the chevalier must
speak," said the false lackey. "Come,
doctor, you must have some powerful
means to restore this man to consciousness.
Give him strength for half an
hour, and then he may die."</p>

<p>"Brother," said the duchess, addressing
this man, "you are too cruel!"</p>

<p>And big drops fell from her eyes as
she gazed upon D'Auterive, who now
breathed again.</p>

<!-- page 79 col 1 -->

<p>The false lackey did not heed the
duchess' grief; he cried eagerly to the
surgeon:</p>

<p>"There! he is coming to himself,
doctor; employ all your skill, and give
him a little life for an hour, a half hour,
ten minutes&mdash;that will do!"</p>

<p>The surgeon took a flask from his
pocket and poured a few drops between
the patient's lips.</p>

<p>"It is your fault, monseigneur," said
the comte to the pretended lackey, "it
was you who directed this blow against
the chevalier."</p>

<p>"He had deserved it, sir; and besides,
do you think I would leave my
sister's honor in the keeping of a babbler
like this?"</p>

<p>The comte shrugged his shoulders,
and he whom he had addressed by the
title of monseigneur, added, with increasing
violence:</p>

<p>"And then were we not sure that the
papers had been removed from Barati's?"</p>

<p>"Vergnes had been entrusted with this
duty, sir, and he alone was sufficiently
familiar with the localities of Barati's
house, to be able to find them. Besides,
you were of the party, and you saw
Vergnes enter the apartment."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him enter, while we
carried off the president, but it was you,
sir, who answered for the fidelity of this
man."</p>

<p>"Demand an account of his fidelity
from her grace, the duchess, for it was
at her orders that he returned with me
from the castle of La Roque, to undertake
this business."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of this man, Leonore?"</p>

<p>"He has either been arrested, or he
is dead, or he has done what he promised,"
replied the duchess.</p>

<p>"We should have burned Barati's
house, as we burned that in which we
held our meetings. That was my advice,
sir; all would then have been
buried in ruins."</p>

<p>"In open day, and how?"</p>

<p>"Why, you have eyes for nothing,
then!" replied the pretended lackey.
"How! they have had time to inform
against the association, to deliberate
in parliament, in which one of <i>ours</i>

<!-- page 79 col 2 -->

holds a seat, and you have not had time
to take the precautions necessary to our
safety?</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, Belissane will tell you
what has passed, and you will then understand
that we have done every thing
that it was in our power to do."</p>

<p>"But Belissane does not make his appearance."</p>

<p>"The parliament is still in session,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>"We must wait for him then, for the
chevalier can tell us nothing."</p>

<p>"He remained at the councillor's after
us, and he knows, perhaps, what has
become of Vergnes."</p>

<p>"He did not know him."</p>

<p>"He at least knew him well enough
to let him enter. It was you, comte, who
arranged this affair, and it seems to me
quite suspicious."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," replied the comte,
"such a suspicion expressed toward a
man like myself, cannot be ended by
strokes of a poignard, as with the chevalier;
it is an insult for which you
should account to me, except for the
office which protects you."</p>

<p>"Brother!&mdash;M. de Frias!"&mdash;cried the
duchess, "is this a time to settle points
of honor, now, when we are in danger
of public disgrace."</p>

<p>"But we cannot remain longer in this
suspense," said the duchess' brother.
"Is this house even, perfectly safe?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied the duchess,
with an air of alarm.</p>

<p>"We have all lost our senses," said
her brother. "They have seen the
chevalier carried wounded into the inn
of this Vergnes, and if the parliament
wishes to secure him, it will, in one way
or another, discover where he is; not
finding him in Vergnes' house, they will
seek for him about the premises, and
will light, perhaps, upon the secret passage
which leads to this building."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," said the surgeon at
this moment, "the chevalier's senses are
returning."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Leonore, question him,
and make him speak; your follies must
at least serve us in something. To the
devil with women and their amours!
They ruin every thing!"</p>

<p>The Duchess made a sign of assent.

<!-- page 80 col 1 -->

The pride which usually dwelt upon her
face was lost in an expression of terrible
anxiety. At a new sign, the other
personages retired from the scene, and
withdrew into a corner of the apartment.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">EXPLANATIONS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chevalier unclosed his eyes, and
beheld the duchess still seated at his
bedside.</p>

<p>"You have not left me, Leonore,"
he said, "it is well; I thank you!"</p>

<p>"Gaston," replied the duchess, "I
would fain save you, for I love you!"</p>

<p>"Let us be silent of that, Leonore.
I approach a moment when we recall
these follies only to implore pardon for
them from heaven. But you said that
I held in my hands the honor of your
name, and of some of the most noble
families. By my soul's welfare, I do
not understand you. Explain it to me
clearly, deliberately; I will try to comprehend
what you say."</p>

<p>"D'Auterive," said the duchess, "do
you know the man who organized the
association of which you are a member?"</p>

<p>"I know <i>him</i>, only, whom, a while
since, I heard addressed by the title of
comte; I know Belissane, Doctor Lambert,
and the fat financier, Lavardiere,
who furnishes me with funds when my
purse is low. You know better than any
one that I had no idea that you were
mingled up in all this."</p>

<p>"This is impossible, D'Auterive, for
this very day you have been entrusted
with a commission which is very singular
in your position. Listen to me
attentively. Langlois' daughter, or the
most beautiful girl in Toulouse, if you
like this phrase better, has been instructed
by the President de Fourvi&egrave;res, whose
mistress she is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You believe it?" said the chevalier
with an air of vexation.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, chevalier. She
was instructed by the president to find
out if you had any knowledge of a

<!-- page 80 col 2 -->

society, which they have been striving
to trace out for the last week. As you
have been told, it was your foolish extravagance
which drew their attention
upon you, and the manner in which you
have pursued this girl, induced the
President de Fourvi&egrave;res to set this snare
for you. Now, with the suspicions
which he already entertained, your
heedless words concerning the manufactory
of taffetas and of diamonds at the
castle of La Roque, was no slight hint
for him."</p>

<p>"I understand you, Leonore, but the
devil take me if I should ever have imagined
that they could make use of a
pretty girl and a cavalier's caprice, to
help them ply the stupid trade of a
spy."</p>

<p>The duchess smiled bitterly, and
gazed at D'Auterive with a singular
expression of pity and of tenderness.</p>

<p>"Poor Gaston!" she said, "what a
child you are! But no matter. Well,
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res was looking about for
the means to push his inquiries farther,
when the shepherds of the mountain presented
their complaint against your
uncle, the Baron de la Roque. The
president had hitherto been secretly at
work, in order to reserve for himself the
honor of this important discovery, so
that when it was decided to send a
member of the parliament to the castle
to investigate the affair, Barati offered
his services without the least suspicion,
of the existence of any secret association,
and Belissane supported him, although
Barati was far from divining the
motive which induced him to do so.</p>

<p>"It would take too much time to explain
to you the causes of this proceeding,
but I can tell you simply, that we
were in possession of the means to make
Barati say what suited us, in case he
made any discovery. While M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, impelled by his bitter hatred
toward Barati, supported this choice also,
he contrived to associate with him his
instrument, Master Langlois, whom he
entrusted with a secret mission to watch
every step of his enemy. This was
the explanation which the president gave
to Belissane after the departure of the
councillor, whose purchases of land,
exceeding, as they did, the limits of his

<!-- page 81 col 1 -->

acknowledged fortune, mid whose eagerness
to undertake the mission to La
Roque, which was prompted by a simple
desire to distinguish himself, appeared
suspicious to the president. Either he
is connected with the society of La
Roque, he thought, and if this is the
case, he will reveal nothing, or he is
ignorant of it, and then he will discover
nothing. In the former case, this mission
will be the means of ruining him with
certainty; for being in the midst of his
accomplices, he will be led into some interviews
and some acts, of which Langlois
will render me an account. In the
latter case, I have the chance of destroying
him, by interpreting his silence
as a proof of his guilt. At any rate, he
will be unable to escape the reproach of
incapacity, when he has in person visited
the seat of this culpable association
without making the slightest discovery."</p>

<p>"These are the schemes of a poltroon,"
said D'Auterive, "but how have you
learned all this?"</p>

<p>"On the very morning of Barati's departure,
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res imparted to the
chamber over which he presides, his suspicion
concerning the existence of the
society of La Roque, yet without referring
to you, since, had he done so, he
would have been obliged to mention the
means which had been employed to draw
the secret from you."</p>

<p>"But how could he avoid mentioning
the source of his original suspicions, for
such he must have had, since he contrived
a plan to make me prate."</p>

<p>"That is a fact which has eluded all
our enquiries, and perhaps you can assist
us in discovering it."</p>

<p>"I see no probability of it;" said D'Auterive.
"No matter; proceed, Leonore."</p>

<p>The chevalier breathed a heavy sigh,
and added:</p>

<p>"Draw nearer, that I may hear you
more easily, for I suffer great pain."</p>

<p>A tear started to the eye of the duchess;
she seated herself upon the bed, and
bending over him, she said in a low and
hurried voice:</p>

<p>"It was not I, Gaston, I swear it."</p>

<p>And at the same moment she placed
her finger upon her lips, and cast a
glance upon him, as if to inform him

<!-- page 81 col 2 -->

that some one was listening to their discourse.</p>

<p>"I will proceed," resumed the duchess,
quickly. "Belissane, on hearing this
terrible revelation, feigned to be delighted,
and opposed the general opinion of the
chamber, which seemed disposed to decide
that the president had not acted in
accordance with his duty. He sustained
him with all his eloquence, which is
said to be very powerful, and it was by
this means that he obtained the confidence
of M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, who, after
the session, informed him of the snare in
which he had taken you."</p>

<p>The duchess gazed at Gaston with increased
tenderness, and said:</p>

<p>"At that moment, your life was forfeited,
and still the person who interposed
in your behalf, was more than any
one else entitled to take revenge."</p>

<p>A glance of gratitude was the sole reply
of the chevalier. The duchess continued,
holding one of the sufferer's
hands in hers:</p>

<p>"Belissane, thus warned, and fearful
lest chance might reveal something to
Barati, despatched a courier to the Comte,
who was then at La Roque in the vast
subterranean vaults, that lie beneath the
castle, and charged him to arrange matters
in such a manner as to impose silence
upon the councillor, if he discovered
or suspected the least thing. And,
but for the extravagance of your uncle,
it would have been the easiest matter in
the world."</p>

<p>"What did he do then?" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>The duchess briefly narrated the
events which had occurred at the castle,
and with which our readers are already
acquainted; she then added:</p>

<p>"If Barati had been placed in a suitable
chamber, they could easily have
found access to him, and without tricks
or conjurations could have warned him
to keep silence, not, concerning what he
had discovered, for he had discovered
nothing, but concerning the conduct of
the baron, which, by compelling the parliament
to avenge the insult which it had
received, might lead to a search in the
castle. In this state of things, it was necessary
to have recourse to the aid of
spectres, and this led to an explanation

<!-- page 82 col 1 -->

between your uncle and Barati, the object
of which, as Langlois imagined,
was to arrange the best means for protecting
the association.</p>

<p>"The error of the Comte was in sparing
this Langlois, whom Belissane has
denounced as a spy upon Barati's movements.
He was fearful lest his disappearance
might lead to a strict investigation.
But no sooner had the wretch
arrived at Toulouse than he repaired to
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, and related all that
had occurred at your uncle's castle. It
was natural enough that the baron's first
resistance and subsequent submission,
the readiness with which Barati forgot the
insult which he had received as a member
of the parliament, and the silence
which he seemed to have enjoined upon
Langlois, should in the eyes of the president
appear like the connivance of two
accomplices who had recognised each
other."</p>

<p>"Leonore," said D'Auterive with a
smile, "you talk of business as glibly
as a flat-cap, and I admire your clearness
in the midst of the danger which
surrounds us."</p>

<p>"Gaston, as I have told you, all the
infamy that can fall upon a noble house,
now totters over our heads, and I will
not perish, and suffer the honor of my
name to perish with me, without essaying
every means of defence."</p>

<p>"Proceed," said D'Auterive; "this is a
singular story, and one far better worth
listening to than mine."</p>

<p>"Well then," resumed the duchess,
"No sooner was M. de Fourvi&egrave;res informed
of what had passed at the castle
of La Roque, than he convened the
chamber of inquest in all haste. Full
credit was given, as you can imagine,
to the report of Langlois, when, at the
hour appointed, Barati failed to make his
appearance. Then, in open session, it
was resolved to send some one to the
councillor's to interrogate him, and to secure
his papers. Belissane gave us
warning of it, and sent word directing
me to manage it so that one of <i>ours</i>
should command the escort. In the
meanwhile the Comte, who had left La
Roque, and who had arrived almost at
the same time with Barati, repaired to
his house, but he was not admitted. He

<!-- page 82 col 2 -->

left a billet for him, but as on returning
he saw M. de Fourvi&egrave;res' carriage drive
up to the councillor's, he feared that Barati
would not have time to remove the
fatal casket, and he at once set about organizing
that riot, of which you were a
witness, while my brother made arrangements
to carry off the president."</p>

<p>"Your brother?" cried D'Auterive,
"Monseigneur de St. Croix!"</p>

<p>The duchess, who had been hurried
away by the rapidity of her narrative,
turned pale, and appeared agitated at this
interruption. A glance of despair admonished
D'Auterive of the imprudence
of which she had been guilty in thus
naming her brother, and of his still greater
imprudence in remarking it.</p>

<p>"I did not say my brother," resumed
the duchess. "Listen to me, I pray
you, without interruption. I had received
word that it was necessary that one of
<i>ours</i> should command the escort of the
president and, in truth, knowing the
snare into which you had fallen, I should
not have thought of you; the comte came
to tell me that it was too late, and that
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res was already at Barati's.
I despatched one of our number to learn
the name of the officer who had been
chosen, and you may judge of my surprise
at hearing that it was you; how
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res could have consented
to your appointment, I am at a loss to
understand, unless he hoped to take you
in the same net with Barati. Well, you
were there! you remember how the man
whom you now know under the title of
comte, warned you through Pierre Couteau
of the object of that visit; you saw
the president carried off, you saw Vergnes,
Rosine's husband, enter Barati's
apartment, and you must be able to give
us some information which will enable
us to discover the casket which he was
charged to remove."</p>

<p>D'Auterive raised himself somewhat
in his bed, and replied in a firm voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>pardieu!</i> and I have seen
him elsewhere," he muttered. "I begin
to comprehend."</p>

<p>"What would you?" said Leonore,
laying her hands on his arm to prevent
him from rising.</p>

<p>"<i>Morbleu</i>, madam, your surgeon is
an ass, and I have no thoughts of dying

<!-- page 83 col 1 -->

of this wound. only I had no objection
to feign myself nearly dead, that they
might not take the trouble to finish with
me, and I know very well all that has
been said here during my pretended
swoon. You can step forth from behind
the curtain, Monseigneur de St. Croix,
although the habit of a lackey becomes
you far less than the cassock of a
bishop, and you, likewise, Comte de
Frias, who, as my uncle thinks, lie
buried in eternal sleep, in the cellar into
which he hurled you, come forth!"</p>

<p>The persons whom D'Auterive addressed
at once stepped forward, and the
chevalier continued:</p>

<p>"In the first place, will you have the
goodness to explain to me the end which
you had in view by the abduction of
M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, and the errand of the
individual who entered Barati's apartment?"</p>

<p>"M. de Fourvi&egrave;res was carried off,"
said the Bishop de St. Croix, in a harsh
tone, "because it was his intention to
remain at the councillor's after your
departure, in order to make a search,
and find, if possible, some traces of Barati's
connection with us."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i> monseigneur," replied
D'Auterive, "you take your precautions
well. What had you to fear from this
search, since Barati was not one of yours,
or of ours rather?"</p>

<p>"He had in his house, though he did
not suspect it, some papers which could
destroy us."</p>

<p>"And these are the papers which
Rosine's honest husband was charged to
remove?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what are these papers, I pray
you?"</p>

<p>"I see no objection to informing you.
They are the documents of our association."</p>

<p>"The documents of your association?"
said the chevalier, in extreme astonishment.</p>

<p>"And which you have signed, sir,"
said the bishop.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed D'Auterive,
"that register to which they made me
affix my signature on page 121. I remember
the number, <i>pardieu!</i> I was

<!-- page 83 col 2 -->

sufficiently admonished to do so! This
register&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Contains also the signature of every
member of the association. Every leaf
is folded and sealed in such a manner
that the persons who are admitted are
acquainted with those who admit them,
and perhaps with three or four more
besides."</p>

<p>"And it is this register that has not
been found?" cried D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"It is, Gaston!" said the duchess.
"Your name, my brother's, the names
of these gentlemen are there, and many
that we do not know, as you did not
know ours."</p>

<p>"But how can I enlighten you concerning
the fate of this register?" rejoined
D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"There are many others in Toulouse
besides ourselves, who are interested in
its removal. If we had had time, we
should have chosen an officer who was
in our interest to accompany the president.
You were appointed; he then,
who proposed you, had doubtless the
same intent with us; therefore if you
would name him, we could obtain new
information. Did not some one designate
you expressly?"</p>

<p>"And if it were so," said D'Auterive,
he must be in the same dilemma with
you, since Vergnes has not found this
precious casket."</p>

<p>"Vergnes entered Barati's apartment,"
said the Bishop de St. Croix, "he,
or one of ours, for he ascended the
stairs with us, after having pronounced
the secret word; this man has since left
the house, for I met him as our carriage
turned into the deserted street, which
bounds Barati's garden, from the walls
of which he had just escaped. It was
Vergnes, was it not, sister? Without
doubt, he has removed the papers, but
we do not know what has become of
him."</p>

<p>"You do not know what has become
of him?" cried D'Auterive, in an angry
tone. "It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Upon my honor!" said the duchess.</p>

<p>D'Auterive reflected a moment, and
then resumed, in a more careless
tone:</p>

<p>"You do not, Leonore? It may be so:
but how the devil do you expect me to

<!-- page 84 col 1 -->

tell you more than you know of him
yourselves?"</p>

<p>"Because as he was acquainted with
a greater number of the associates than
we, he has gone, perhaps, to place the
papers in the hands of some other member,
in the hands of him who designated
you to accompany M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, and
if we knew who that one was, we should
be more tranquil."</p>

<p>The chevalier, who had not remarked
the entrance of the man who had thrust
aside Barati, imagined that he who had
been charged with the duty of removing
the papers, had been unable to accomplish
his errand, and was persuaded that
Clemence must have secured them, and
after a new silence, he resumed:</p>

<p>"Answer me frankly and without
evasion! perhaps I may be able to reassure
you more completely. How is
it that the papers were at Barati's?"</p>

<p>"They were deposited there five
years ago, as it seems; we do not know
by whom; we do not know wherefore.
It was not until yesterday that we were
warned to secure them in one way or
another. In other respects our instructions
were precise; we were told the
place where they were to be found, and
the shape of the casket which contained
them."</p>

<p>"A casket covered with shagreen,
was it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" exclaimed the comte and
Monseigneur de St. Croix, with one
voice.</p>

<p>"Placed upon the upper shelf of Barati's
bookcase?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>D'Auterive suffered an exclamation
to escape him, but as if a remnant of
doubt still agitated him, he merely answered:</p>

<p>"Well, then, be at ease, I know that
this casket has been removed by some
one, but it was neither Vergnes nor any
of those to whom you refer."</p>

<p>"And have you any idea who this
person is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth, but I cannot tell you.
and it will be necessary for me to find
the person myself," said D'Auterive,
who was unwilling to name Clemence.</p>

<p>"You believe him to be secure against
all inquiry?"</p>

<!-- page 84 col 2 -->

<p>D'Auterive appeared anxious, and
replied:</p>

<p>"I do not think it possible that any
one can suspect him, and he will have
sufficient prudence, I believe, to place
the casket beyond the reach of danger."</p>

<p>"It is probable," said the comte, "for
if he has he been charged with this mission,
he must be acquainted with the
contents of these papers, and as his life
is at stake doubtless, as well as ours, he
must have destroyed them, unless he has
been able to conceal them safely."</p>

<p>"God grant it!" said the duchess.</p>

<p>"As to his being one of ours, I doubt
it," said D'Auterive, "but I will answer
for him that he is incapable of treachery,
although I never knew him until to-day."</p>

<p>"You know him then?" said the
bishop, harshly. "I would give half
my fortune to see this casket again, and
to know who it is that holds us thus in
his power."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" said D'Auterive, who was
disturbed by a new fear, and was anxious
to leave the house on any terms, "I
think that you may sleep in peace, as I
should do if I were at home, for I am
not likely to do it here."</p>

<p>"You are too weak to return to your
dwelling," said Dr. Lambert, who had
listened to this discourse, without manifesting,
in the slightest degree, the anxiety
which agitated the others.</p>

<p>"Besides," said the duress, "you
are here under my safeguard; you have
nothing now to fear from any one."</p>

<p>"Yet I should like to know something
more positive respecting the condition of
our affairs," said D'Auterive, "for thus
far, scarcely a name has been mentioned
except my own," he added, raising himself
upon his bed.</p>

<p>"Your name is known only to M. de
Fourvi&egrave;res, who will be silent," said the
bishop, "and to Belissane, who is one
of <i>ours</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" said D'Auterive, "you
have strange means, it seems, to render
every body silent."</p>

<p>"Where is the man," said the bishop,
"in the history of whose life there is not
some act which he would conceal, and
which those who know of it, can use to
terrify him?"</p>

<!-- page 85 col 1 -->

<p>"You have none, then scored to my account,
monseigneur, since you have resorted
to a poignard stroke to render me
silent, for it was not Vergnes' fault if the
blow did not kill me outright."</p>

<p>"Vergnes! say you, sir? It was not
Vergnes who struck you."</p>

<p>"It was he, I swear it; I knew him
well."</p>

<p>"It is not possible, sir; it must have
been another!" cried the bishop.</p>

<p>A man in the habit of a boatman of
the Garonne entered the apartment.</p>

<p>"What took place when I despatched
you in pursuit of the chevalier?"</p>

<p>"When I overtook him, sir, the work
was done, and so thoroughly, as it seemed,
that there was no need of my lending
a hand to it."</p>

<p>All present looked upon each other
with an air of stupefaction, and even
D'Auterive seemed dismayed, as if he
had just made some terrible discovery.
Still he did not speak; he gazed upon
the duchess with. a strange mingling
of alarm and compassion, while Monseigneur
de St. Croix exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Another, then, has directed this
chastisement."</p>

<p>"Leonore," said the chevalier, "I am a
man of but slight importance, and they
will stick at nothing to get me out of
the way. But, <i>pardieu!</i> I will not die
thus without securing my own vengeance
and your safety."</p>

<p>"But if the duchess is in danger,"
said the bishop, "the same peril threatens
us, and you must speak out before us
all."</p>

<p>"You, gentlemen, have probably
nothing to fear," replied D'Auterive,
"and if I should name to you the man
whom I suspect, the man who has as great
an interest as ourselves in the destruction
of these papers, you would easily
comprehend that, except myself and the
duchess, the safety of no one here present
is endangered."

<p>"Gaston," cried the duchess, as a ray
of light flashed across her mind at
these words, "could it be&mdash;"</p>

<p>The same thought seemed to occur to
all present, for each one exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He!"</p>

<p>But all stopped ere they pronounced
the name or the title of the unknown

<!-- page 85 col 2 -->

chief of the association; they gazed one
upon the other, as if to inquire whether
each had the same suspicion, when on a
sudden, the man called Vergnes entered
hastily, followed by an individual of
about fifty years of age, of lofty stature,
and of a stern, haughty, and menacing
visage; he was wrapped in a long
mantle, which he threw quickly aside,
while Vergnes said in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"This is the nest, monseigneur!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">THE MISSING CASKET.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the sight of her husband, (for it was
he who had just entered), the Duchess
de Nevers sank upon the bed on which
D'Auterive lay stretched, while the remaining
actors in the scene appeared as
if stricken by lightning, and cast a glance
upon the chevalier, as if to implore his
aid. The latter, on the contrary, suffered
a smile of triumph to play upon his lips,
and he endured without the slightest
symptom of alarm, the stern and menacing
glance which the Duke de Nevers
cast upon him. Uncertain whether
Clemence had secured the papers in
question, or whether Vergnes had anticipated
her, D'Auterive felt that he had
no chance of safety against the two-fold
danger that now menaced him, except
to excite the duke's fears by pretending
to be in possession of the casket,
and by threatening to make such use of
it as would include him in the common
ruin which now impended over the association.
He looked him in the face
therefore, with impertinent irony, and
bowed slightly.</p>

<p>The Duke de Nevers, who, from his
name and rank, was accustomed to see
every one tremble before him, reached
his hand to the hilt of his sword, as if to
unsheath it, but he paused on hearing
the voice of D'Auterive, who cried in a
tone of mockery:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! monseigneur, you think,
then, that you will finish the business
better than that scoundrel Vergnes!
There is no need of such haste, my
lord duke; there are more people of

<!-- page 86 col 1 -->

your acquaintance here than you think,
perhaps."</p>

<p>The duke controlled his impatience,
and turning to his wife, said, in a firm and
imperative tone:</p>

<p>"Madam, you will this evening enter
the Convent of the Benedictines, never
to leave it. You, my brother, will, this
same evening, resign the exercise of
your episcopal authority into the hands
of the Archbishop of Toulouse, who will
name to you the place in which his holiness
requires you to do penance for the
unexampled crime of which you have
been guilty. As to you, gentlemen,
your business has been judged in full
session, and you can commend your
souls to God."</p>

"That is to say," cried D'Auterive,
"that we are to be butchered here like
dogs, and that in an hour, probably, this
house will be burned to the ground, as the
other was this morning, that no trace of
your atrocities may remain, my lord
duke."</p>

<p>The duke's brow grew still more lowering,
and he replied:</p>

<p>"Chevalier, I would I could invent
new tortures, that you might die a death
such as you merit."</p>

<p>"And wherefore, monseigneur, do I
merit such a death? Is it because I
have not yet repeated to these gentlemen
the name of the principal accomplice of
our society?"</p>

<p>The duke stood silent for a moment,
and then replied:</p>

<p>"It will suffice that the law is informed
of it, and they will learn who
he is from its sentence."</p>

<p>"That is by no means probable,
monseigneur," said the chevalier, "for
you vouchsafe him a protection so peculiar,
that, instead of being butchered
like myself, or shut up in a convent, to
do penance, like the Bishop de St. Croix
and the duchess, it is he who condemns
as well as executes."</p>

<p>"You are mad, fool!" said the duke, with
an emotion which he was unable to disguise,
"I do not comprehend you."</p>

<p>"Ah, you comprehend me well, monseigneur!
'Chevalier,' you said to me
this morning, 'they require of me a
trusty officer to execute a foolish arrest
for a silly affair, touching the dignity of

<!-- page 86 col 2 -->

the parliament. As I have some reason
to conciliate the good will of these
gentlemen, if it were, only for my suit
against the Riquets, I will grant their
request. But, as, on the other hand, I
am somewhat indebted to Barati for services
which he has rendered me in
times past, tell him secretly, and in my
name, to burn some papers which were
placed in his hands about five years ago,
and which might compromise him.
They will be found in a casket covered
with shagreen, placed upon the upper
shelf of Barati's bookcase.' Now, I
was disposed to obey you, monseigneur,
but I was unable, for could not deliver
my message to Barati under the very
eyes of the president; I could not even
make him a sign, but I secured these papers."</p>

<p>"You!" cried the duke, turning
pale, and casting a glance of alarm at
Vergnes, who hung his head.</p>

<p>D'Auterive saw at once that the duke
had been deceived, and that Vergnes
had not succeeded in removing the casket,
as he had doubtless asserted.</p>

<p>"Oh," resumed the chevalier, "I saw
master Vergnes enter the apartment, and
I plainly heard the pass-word, '<i>Speech
is silver, but silence is gold</i>,' which he
whispered in my ear as he ascended the
stairs, but the business was done, although
I did not suspect that this was
his errand to the councillor's; the idea
did not even strike me with the poignard
thrust which he dealt me on your part,
doubtless."</p>

<p>The duke cast his eyes to the ground.
D'Auterive continued:</p>

<p>"But I confess to you that within the
last hour, since I have questioned my
friends here, I begin to comprehend the
interest you take in the destruction of
these papers."</p>

<p>The duke raised his eyes as if
about to question him, but D'Auterive
continued in a tone of increasing impertinence:</p>

<p>"But as to these papers, they are under
my control, now, monseigneur, for
they are in the hands of a person who
will deliver them, not to Belissane, nor
to any other like him, but to some member
of the parliament, who has a strong
desire to humble your severity and your

<!-- page 87 col 1 -->

insolence, my lord duke; and we shall
see then, if, notwithstanding your title as
governor of the province, notwithstanding
your high birth, you will not, at last,
mount the stool of the vilest criminal&mdash;you,
who have granted your protection
to a band of coiners, who have deluged
Spain, Genoa, Venice, all the Levant,
and even the Indies, with false and
worthless money. For all of us are but
counterfeiters, and condemned by law,
to the gallows."</p>

<p>The chevalier might have continued in
this strain still longer. The duke seemed
sunk in the deepest dejection. The
rigidity of his face contrasted strangely
with the almost convulsive movements
of his eyes. He glanced alternately and
hurriedly at all present, as if counting
them, in order to learn the number of
blows which it would be necessary for
him to strike. At last, observing the
curiosity with which all watched the
expression of his features, he closed his
eyes as if to escape this scrutiny. An
entire minute (and this is a long time
under such circumstances), an entire
minute passed in fearful silence. Finally,
he seemed to have recovered somewhat
from his agitation, and affecting a
carelessness which was belied by the
expression of his compressed lips, he
cried:</p>

<p>"So, then! it was for this that the
duchess repaired hither, and not, as that
wretch declared, for an amorous meeting."</p>

<p>He looked around after Vergnes, but
the latter had disappeared. The duke
continued, turning to the duchess:</p>

<p>"Pardon my mistake, madam. Let
us speak no more of it. For the rest, I
can inform you that the affair is nearly
finished. Fourvi&egrave;res has declared that
he was deceived by false reports, and as
care has been taken to fabricate no
French coin, and as no one has discovered
the slightest traces of the enterprise,
the president will pass for a fool. Yet,
to give a color to Barati's arrest, M. de
la Roque will be called to an account for
having insulted the parliament, and Barati,
for not having at once given information
against the baron. The latter
will be amerced in a fine, which you will
pay, chevalier, and the councillor will

<!-- page 87 col 2 -->

be reprimanded so gently, that he will
have every reason to be satisfied. We
will arrange it."</p>

<p>While he spoke, the duke gradually
regained his composure. D'Auterive's
glance did not quit him for a moment,
and the duchess vainly endeavored to
assume that air of confidence, which becomes
a woman so basely accused. The
others, relieved from all fears for their
personal safety, began to breathe more
freely. The duke continued:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my brother, for the
alarm I have caused you. After all, if
any one is excusable in this affair, it is
you, for you have employed the profits
of our enterprise, in embellishing and
adorning your cathedral; you have assuredly
paid dear for the pardon which
heaven owes you. As to myself, you all
know, gentlemen, that the greater part
of my gains have been employed to
serve the vast projects of M. Riquet.&mdash;M.
de Fries, we have an account to
settle. We will arrange, at the same
time, that of these gentlemen. For the
present," he added, glancing at them in
a manner which proved that he was resolved
to be obeyed, "for the present, I
beg you to leave me alone with the chevalier;
he has been somewhat too prodigal
of his louis to a certain Mademoiselle
Langlois, and his purse needs replenishing,
perhaps. I beg the duchess also,
to lend me her advice in this affair; she
will remain with us."</p>

<p>No one present had been duped by the
manner in which the duke feigned, to
look upon the relations of the duchess
with the chevalier, after the latter had
named him as the chief of this band of
counterfeiters. No one, therefore, wished
to stand in the way of an explanation,
which would probably end in an amicable
arrangement, and a promise of mutual
forgiveness. Still, the Bishop de
St. Croix whispered to his sister:</p>

<p>"We will not leave the house."</p>

<p>The duke went with them as far as
the door. The Comte de Frias here
said to him in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, concede nothing until
my return."</p>

<p>On the other hand, D'Auterive raised
himself upon his bed, plucked the duchess

<!-- page 88 col 1 -->

gently by the robe, and said, hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Try to find me a sword!"</p>

<p>The duchess, without turning, put her
hand to her bosom, then, passing it behind
her, reached Gaston a poignard, which he
at once seized.</p>

<p>During this hasty movement, the remaining
personages of this scene had
left the apartment, and the duke, turning
towards his wife, perceived the hand of
the duchess near that of the chevalier.</p>

<p>"What pledge of love are you giving
to your gallant?" he said, in a tone in
which the haughtiness of a great lord
was blended with the rudeness of a man
confident of his personal strength.</p>

<p>D'Auterive raised himself to a sitting
posture upon his bed, and showing the
poignard to the duke, he replied:</p>

<p>"It is not a pledge of love, monseigneur,
but it is a pledge of safety to us
both. You were right; we have an account
to settle together, and it is well
that we can discuss it upon somewhat
equal terms, for if you wield a longer
weapon, I shall at least, thanks to this
steel, have a chance of refusing your
conditions, until I have told you ours."</p>

<p>"Ours?" cried the duke, darkly.&mdash;"Do
you hear him, madam? The chevalier
names your interests in common
with his own. Does it please you that it
should be so? If it contents you, madam,
I consent. You can quit my house
to-morrow, for that of M. D'Auterive,
and I swear to you that I will demand an
account of him, neither before the parliament,
nor at the point of my sword."</p>

<p>"Duke de Nevers," said Leonore
proudly, "your proposition is insulting;
you know me too well to think that I
will submit to voluntary dishonor."</p>

<p>"Must I submit to it then?" cried the
duke. "Must I receive you in my
house? must I honor, before all the
world, you, who have dishonored me?
You, on your side, madam, know me too
well to think that I will submit to it,&mdash;The
matter cannot terminate thus."</p>

<p>"Let us hear, then, monseigneur,"
said D'Auterive, in a tone of mockery,
"let us hear what you propose."</p>

<p>"In the first place," said the Duke de
Nevers, "let us set aside from this discussion,
all that relates to the business

<!-- page 88 col 2 -->

of the society. You will restore the papers
which are in your hands to those
whom they concern; this is a sacred
duty which you cannot fail to perform.
That done, we shall both stand, face to
face, free to settle matters as becomes
gentlemen in our position."</p>

<p>"I see no other objection to your proposition,
except my ignorance of the
mode in which we are to settle matters,"
replied D'Auterive. "Have the goodness
to explain this; then I am entirely at
your service."</p>

<p>The duke's features changed at this
question, a smile played about his lips;
he assumed an air of indifference, and
said to D'Auterive:</p>

<p>"Chevalier, you are a hare-brained
fellow, who, with your five and twenty
years, have committed those follies which
are usual at your age. But you have
mistaken for love, the triumph of your
vanity, and have said to yourself, that
the chief happiness of a gentleman, was
to be found in the favor of a dame of
noble birth&mdash;of a duchess!"</p>

<p>"My lord duke," said Leonore indignantly,
"From the manner in which you
commence, I divine your aim. Take
care lest I profit by your example, and
in my turn, grant you no mercy."</p>

<p>"At your pleasure, madam; we are
not here to exchange compliments."</p>

<p>"Suffer monseigneur to proceed,"
said D'Auterive dryly. "What he has
thus far said, appears quite reasonable,
and if he continues in this strain, we can,
perhaps, come to a perfect understanding."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Gaston?" cried the
duchess.</p>

<p>"Chevalier," resumed the duke, casting
a glance of irony upon his wife.
"You have dreamed the dream of all
young fools, who are ambitious of intrigues
with dames of high rank, and
you have beheld your dream realized.
You, a poor chevalier, have gained the
favor of a duchess. But what is the favor
of a duchess, when one cannot boast
of it? It is not worth that of the meanest
peasant girl, with sparkling eyes and
rosy cheeks, whom one can parade before
all Toulouse. Above all, when the
said duchess numbers some forty years,
and when she has a son scarcely younger

<!-- page 89 col 1 -->

than yourself. It is a net in which
a man is vexed to find himself taken, but
from which he extricates himself as soon
as possible, and I believe, my dear Gaston,
that I anticipate your desires in begging
you to resign your first and ancient
love."</p>

<p>Leonore cast her eyes to the ground
as her husband spoke; a burning blush
covered her face, and the duke continued:</p>

<p>"I do not say, my dear chevalier, that
Leonore does not well affect the airs of a
young and simple maiden; you see she
blushes admirably, but there is a tint of
rage in that dark flush which is no mark
of innocence."</p>

<p>At these words, a death-like paleness
took the place of that blush which mantled
upon Leonore's cheeks. Her frame
trembled, her hand was stretched convulsively
toward the chevalier, and she
muttered in a low voice:</p>

<p>"The poignard! give me the poignard!"</p>

<p>"Listen to monseigneur, madam,"
said D'Auterive, drawing back from her,
"all this does not yet tell us at what he
aims."</p>

<p>"It is this, M. D'Auterive," said the
duke; "You must give the lie to all idle
rumors, respecting you both, by at once
seeking in marriage the hand of some
young maiden who pleases you&mdash;Langlois'
daughter, for example. With her,
you must quit Toulouse and France, and
provided that you never cross my path,
I promise you to forget a folly that I attribute
solely to your extreme youth."</p>

<p>"That is but reasonable," said the
chevalier. "And madam, what is to be
her lot?"</p>

<p>"You ask too much, M. D'Auterive;
that is an affair for me to decide upon."</p>

<p>"Chevalier," said the duchess, rising,
"think only of yourself; I shall know
how to secure my safety."</p>

<p>"I know it, madam," said D'Auterive
in a respectful tone, "I do not doubt of
your courage. But even in regard to
you, there is something which concerns
me personally, in the future intentions of
the duke, as well as in the words which
he has just uttered."</p>

<p>"And what is it, then, chevalier?"
said the Duke de Nevers, laughing.
"Do you fear lest I should not secure

<!-- page 89 col 2 -->

you sufficiently against the amorous
claims of your superannuated mistress?
Do not be alarmed; the place in which
I shall confine her is not one where she
can steal out to repair to Rosine's after
having threatened her gallant with the
loss of his commission, through the influence
of her bleary-eyed husband, if he
does not keep the appointment. Fear
nothing for yourself in the measures that
I shall take."</p>

<p>"You speak amiss, monseigneur,"
said D'Auterive, giving way to the anger
which lighted up his face with scorn, wad
flashed in his burning glances, "you
speak amiss, sir; these measures will not
protect me; they will insult me."</p>

<p>"How?" said the duke.</p>

<p>"They will insult me as your words
have insulted me."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," cried the duke
in fury.</p>

<p>"You have thought, then, monseigneur,
that I would suffer the woman that
I loved to be outraged with impunity, and
that I know not how to protect her.
Culpable in your eyes, she is innocent in
mine. You have the right to punish
her, it is my duty to defend her. You
shall respect her, sir, you shall respect
her! You think you have made her
blush at her faults; you are deceived,
sir! she but blushes in my presence at
being the wife of a brute."</p>

<p>"Chevalier!" cried the duke, drawing
his sword.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur" said D'Auterive, rising
from his bed, "you are better armed
than I am, but I am the younger;
thanks to your assassins, I am wounded,
but my frame is not exhausted by the
basest excesses and the vilest debauchery.
The contest may turn against me
here, but to-morrow you will be vanquished
in your turn, for if I leave this
house a corpse, to-morrow your secret
crimes will be revealed to the tribunals
of the kingdom."</p>

<p>"You forget that this will implicate
the duchess also."</p>

<p>"Ask her, monseigneur, ask her if she
would not prefer the infamy of a prison
to the misery of living in dependence
upon you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Gaston!" cried Leonore:

<!-- page 90 col 1 -->

"Exile, the scaffold, rather than these
insults?"</p>

<p>"You see, monseigneur," said Gaston,
"and still she does not run this hazard,
for if she will but name the number
of the leaf upon which her name is written,
it shall be torn out."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By me, sir!" said D'Auterive "by
me, for those who are near us will defend
me if I summon them, since they
know that my death is their ruin."</p>

<p>"But they know likewise, that my
ruin is theirs also."</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, let us treat of affairs
seriously, and without rudeness."</p>

<p>"Is it because I have told you madam's
age that I have been rude?"</p>

<p>The duke well knew how sensitive
was the spot which he touched, and the
duchess trembled anew with rage.</p>

<p>"I knew it, monseigneur," said D'Auterive,
"how could it be otherwise, when
the birth-day of a princess of Puzzano
holds so fair a place in the catalogue of
the great names of Europe? It is the
misfortune of those of noble birth to be thus
publicly known. You yourself have experienced
it, since only after a formal
decree were you recognised as the heir
of the Duke de Nevers, who averred
that a lackey of your mother's had too
much to do with your birth."</p>

<p>"Chevalier!" cried the Duke de Nevers.</p>

<p>"It is your turn to listen, monseigneur,"
said D'Auterive; "yes; I knew
the age of the duchess, but when I saw
her, I forgot it."</p>

<p>The chevalier then assumed an air of
courteous gallantry, and added:</p>

<p>"The brightness of her beautiful eyes,
the perfection of her features, the admirable
proportions of her form, at once
effaced from my memory that date which
is true only in the book in which it is written,
but which becomes false in her presence."</p>

<p>The duke answered by a disdainful
smile, and a glance of contempt which
he cast upon his wife.</p>

<p>"And then," said the chevalier, "there
are secrets of the heart which are never
known to a husband who has been imposed
upon a woman against her will.
Monseigneur, I swear to you that among

<!-- page 90 col 2 -->

the fairest, the dearest remembrances of
my life, will be the love at which you
have just scoffed. Leonore, no woman
can compare with you in beauty," continued
D'Auterive, "and if I have ever
been false to the love with which you
have inspired me, it was because, in the
words of monseigneur, I was a fool, and
did not know in what my heart's pride,
my true happiness consisted."</p>

<p>These eulogiums, these protestations
were evidently intended to retaliate upon
the duke somewhat of that keen humiliation
which he had inflicted upon the
duchess, and it was a singular position
for a husband, to hear another, thus, as
we may say, do homage to his wife. But
between these two men, who were thus
heaping insults upon each other, stood the
woman who was the subject of this
strange discussion, and who, after having
been wounded in her pride by the gross
outrages of the one, now suffered in
her heart from the false eulogiums of
the other. She felt that they were false;
they were generous in their intent, but
this intent was too evident. She raised
her head, and elevating herself above the
cruel grief which tortured her, she said,
proudly:</p>

<p>"It is my turn, gentlemen, it is my turn
to tell you my conditions; and although
I wield neither sword nor poignard, although
I possess neither the public authority
which renders the duke so insolent,
nor the concealed power which has
given you, M. D'Auterive, the strength
to undertake my defence, yet I will tell
you my conditions, my resolve, and I
swear to you, you will accept them&mdash;I
swear it to you, whether they please you
or displease you."</p>

<p>At this proud address the Duke de
Nevers gazed at his wife darkly, but
with a glance which had lost its audacious
insolence. Gaston, on his part, watched
her with anxiety, for in his present position,
he could scarcely refuse to obey
her, and with his knowledge of her character,
it was impossible for him to foresee
what her decision might be.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, and you, M. D'Auterive,"
resumed the duchess with true
dignity, "do not occupy yourselves with
my future lot in so far as it concerns
myself alone: it will trouble neither of

<!-- page 91 col 1 -->

you. Monseigneur, you fear to see me
enter your house again; you are too
vain; you dream of impossibilities. Before
you uttered the gross insults which
you have inflicted upon a woman, who
is not too old to remember when you
begged for her hand upon your knees, I
had resolved that we should never again
dwell beneath the same roof. But, monseigneur,
I will leave your house, I will
not be driven from it. You have condemned
me to end my days in a convent;
I receive this destiny without accepting
it from you. I will not be hurried thither
as a criminal, I will retire thither as a
woman to whom the world has grown
insupportable."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon dieu</i>, madam!" said the duke
with a sneer, "I will not stick at words,
provided things are as I understand
them."</p>

<p>"You understand also, Duke de Nevers,
that within a month, you will resign
your government."</p>

<p>"You are losing your senses, madam."</p>

<p>"No, my lord, no. Since we have
begun to execute upon each other the
justice which we merit, each one must
have his share. I accept my condemnation,
I but disguise it; do you accept
yours, and you can disguise it beneath
the show of a proud disinterestedness, a
lofty renunciation of the grandeurs of
state."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said the duke, with a
smile. "And now I am curious to know
the sentence you will pronounce against
this gentle cavalier."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, M. D'Auterive did not
enter your association voluntarily; it
was to save his life that he submitted to
the conditions which were imposed upon
him."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten, in truth," said the
duke, "that M. D'Auterive has found
you quite innocent, and it was but fair
that you should render him the same
justice. Well, your chevalier will do
what he pleases, then, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, monseigneur; if M. D'Auterive
would act as a gentleman, he ought to
leave France, for upon this condition
alone can he render us our security
without danger to himself. Deprived of
the documents which now protect him,

<!-- page 91 col 2 -->

he would ever find in you an enemy, too
powerful, too implacable too unscrupulous,
perhaps, for his safety, and he would
tremble hourly for his life. Should he
keep these papers, he would possess a
power too great, a power that might
tempt him to abuse it against those whose
honor and life he held in his possession.
It is necessary, therefore, that he should
resign them. He will do it, I am sure;
I expect it, M. D'Auterive."</p>

<p>Gaston grew serious and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he said at last, "the
proposal of the duchess is honorable for
us both. Upon these terms I shall not
owe my life to you, and you will not
leave yours in my keeping; the thing is
simple on both sides. And since the
proposition that I should leave France,
comes to me as advice, as a prayer, and
not as a command, I am ready to subscribe
to it; but the difficulty lies in
executing these conditions."</p>

<p>The duke appeared to reflect in his
turn, and whether it were that he spoke
in good faith, or that he concealed a
thought of vengeance beneath his assent,
he replied:</p>

<p>"The difficulty is not so great as you
imagine; you know, doubtless, where
these papers are. Let us go together;
we will destroy them in the presence of
one another, and then each will be free
to act as he pleases."</p>

<p>"You are recurring to your former
proposition, monseigneur; your safety
first, and then mine and that of the
duchess will be at your mercy. No, my
lord, it shall not be so; you must confide
to my honor as a gentleman; and I
swear to you, you shall have no cause
to repent of it."</p>

<p>"You claim a right which you do not
yield to others, sir," replied the duke,
"my word is well worth yours."</p>

<p>"No, monseigneur, for you have not
injured me, and I have no debt of vengeance
to demand either of you, or of any
one of those whom I know as belonging
to us, while you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and then added suddenly:</p>

<p>"Stay, monseigneur, I see we, can
never settle it in this way. I have two
propositions to offer to you. In this house
there are cards and dice, and there are
also swords; by which game will you

<!-- page 92 col 1 -->

decide who shall be master of the other's
destiny? The question matters little to
our associates, for they are indifferent to
me as well as to you. They shall be
judge of the game, or of the combat."</p>

<p>"You are too skilful a gamester for
me, chevalier," said the duke.</p>

<p>"In that case bring the swords."</p>

<p>"You cannot hold yours, sir."</p>

<p>"And besides, I would not suffer it!"
said the duchess. "It is for me alone to
command in this house. I would gladly
have given one of you the opportunity of
displaying generosity, but you are so
busied with your mutual fears, that it
remains for me to say what you must do.
M. D'Auterive, you will tell me where
these papers are; when I know where
to find them, I will take it upon myself
to insure your departure; and when he
is in safety," she added, turning to her
husband, "I will place your honor beyond
the reach of danger."</p>

<p>The duke knit his brows at the proposition,
and D'Auterive made a gesture of
disapproval, then both glanced at the
duchess as if to satisfy themselves of the
honesty of her intentions. The air with
which, amid their fears and disquietudes,
they gazed upon her, and then at each
other, was so ludicrous, that D'Auterive
burst into a fit of laughter, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The devil seize me, if we do not look
like three robbers, who know not how
to separate after sharing their booty.
The first who goes is afraid lest the
others should assassinate him as soon
as he has turned his back."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the duke, assuming
an air of frankness. "Let us
despatch; and to convince you that I am
more disposed to arrange matters than
you are, I will accept the duchess' offer
upon the conditions that she has proposed
for herself, and for you also, sir."</p>

<p>"And for yourself likewise, monseigneur,"
replied D'Auterive, rising.</p>

<p>"It shall be my care to see that he
accepts them," said the duchess.</p>

<p>"On what day," said the duke, "will
you place in madam's hands the papers
in question?"</p>

<p>"That does not depend solely upon
me," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"How!" cried the duke, "are not the
documents in the keeping of a person

<!-- page 92 col 2 -->

who will restore them as soon as you
demand them?"</p>

<p>"At all events they are in the keeping
of a person who will not place them
in the hands of justice," said D'Auterive,
perceiving his error, "unless he does not
see me within two days."</p>

<p>At this moment a confused noise was
heard in the adjoining apartment, and the
Comte de Frias entered in haste.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he cried "while we
are wasting our time in endless discussion,
the parliament is prosecuting its
inquest, deterred neither by the threats
which have been used toward some of its
members, nor by lack of proofs. M. De
Fourvi&egrave;res has been arrested in full
session, for having retracted his accusation,
and he has basely confessed the
artifice which he employed against the
chevalier. The dwelling of the latter
has been entered, and a most active
search is on foot there. That of Barati's,
also, has been ransacked from top to bottom,
and the councillor's daughter has
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Disappeared!" cried D'Auterive,
with an air of terror, which was unobserved
except by the duchess.</p>

<p>"A formal accusation must have been
entered," cried the comte, "what else
can account for the pertinacity with
which parliament pursues this business?"</p>

<p>"How did you hear this?" said the
duke in alarm.</p>

<p>"From Belissane, who, as he told me,
stole from the chamber, on seeing the
turn which matters were taking. He
then went to his house, provided himself
with money, mounted his horse,
and must now be upon the road to
Spain."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n! D'Auterive, we are lost!"
cried the duke, "Speak! where are
these papers? we must have them
within the hour, either by craft or by
violence."</p>

<p>The chevalier, equally alarmed
with the rest, was about to speak, when
a glance from the duchess silenced
him.</p>

<p>"Still," said Frias, "there has been
no mention of names. In a word, matters
stand thus, or did, when Belissane
left the chamber. Information has been

<!-- page 93 col 1 -->

given of the existence of a vast manufactory
of counterfeit foreign coin, and not, as
it seems, to M. de Fourvi&egrave;res only, but to
several other members of the parliament.
Some of the principal personages
in the province, are accused of
being engaged in it, but no one has been
named; even the place where it exists
was not designated; and it was the
heedlessness of M. D'Auterive alone
which gave rise to suspicions on this
point."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" exclaimed the duke, "<i>sauve
qui peut!</i> Belissane is a shrewd knave,
he has watched the course of things, and
has taken a step which we would do
well to imitate&mdash;that is, to reach the
frontiers as soon as possible."</p>

<p>These words agitated all present.
Several stepped aside, and were about
to withdraw, when suddenly the woman
whom we have named Rosine, entered,
saying:</p>

<p>"Silence! I beg you! Two persons
have just entered my house, and they
might overhear you."</p>

<p>"How, woman," cried the duke, "you
left your den open, and we here?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," replied Rosine, with
an air far from respectful, "the den
which hides this house, where duchesses
meet with chevaliers, and dukes with
grisettes, this den is always open until
eight in the evening, and it is now but
half-past seven. What would the patrol
of the suburb say, if it were closed before
the usual hour? they would suspect
mischief."</p>

<p>"Who are these persons?" said M.
de Frias.</p>

<p>"A soldier of good mien, and as I
think of the company of M. D'Auterive,
and a young maiden who seems not to
know where she is. They have taken
up their quarters in the outer hall."</p>

<p>"But you can send them away," said
the duke.</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," said Rosine, "but
not before half an hour, when I put out
the light."</p>

<p>These replies were uttered with an
impertinence, which, to those who were
acquainted with Rosine's usual demeanor,
seemed to indicate that the arrival of
these new comers was not a matter of
indifference to some who were here assembled.

<!-- page 93 col 2 -->

D'Auterive understood the
matter thus, for he rose and said:</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, I will engage,
with the help of a few louis, to despatch
this gallant to entertain his lass in some
other inn of the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"But is there no other way of leaving
this place?" said the duke.</p>

<p>"No other, monseigneur," said Rosine,
"no other through my dwelling;
as to the doors of this house which open
upon the street, you would be obliged to
force them, for they have not been unlocked
these three years."</p>

<p>"Try again to get rid of them," said
the Comte de Frias.</p>

<p>"I have tried my best," replied Rosine
in a tone of ill humor, "but the soldier
does not look like a man so very easily
managed; he told me that he was resolved
to remain in the inn, since there were
others here also, and when I told him that
he was mistaken, he bade me listen to the
sound of your voices, which could be heard
quite distinctly, and he added:  'Take
care lest I call the patrol! for I saw a
man enter here just now, who looked
more like a thief than a gallant or an
honest tippler.' He meant the Comte de
Frias."</p>

<p>"See to it then, D'Auterive," said
the duke, forgetting in his alarm, cautions
against the chevalier's escape.</p>

<p>D'Auterive left the apartment followed
by Rosine, who whispered to him in a
low voice:</p>

<p>"Hasten! they are friends."</p>

<p>The chevalier hurried from the house,
crossed the garden, and as he entered
the hall, he perceived Pierre Couteau
and Clemence Barati.</p>

<p>"Here I am, mademoiselle," he said
to Clemence.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," cried the maid, "help me!
I know not what to do, nor what will
become of me."</p>

<p>"What has happened, then, my pretty
one?" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Are you ignorant?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly so."</p>

<p>"Why, my father," replied Clemence,
"do you know where he is? what they
have done with him? what danger
threatens him?"</p>

<p>"None," said D'Auterive, "none, if
you have followed the council that I

<!-- page 94 col 1 -->

gave you; none, if you had time to secure
the casket which I described to
you."</p>

<p>"I succeeded in doing so, sir; but
what does this casket contain?"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" said D'Auterive,
with an eagerness so remarkable that it
surprised Clemence, in spite of her
alarm.</p>

<p>"This casket concerns my father only,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"It contains the safety of a hundred
persons of the highest distinction; you
must place it in my hands, mademoiselle,
and at once."</p>

<p>Clemence hesitated for an instant, then
extricating her arm from the mantle
which enveloped her, she said:</p>

<p>"Here it is, chevalier!"</p>

<p>When D'Auterive held in his hands
this precious casket, which rendered him
at last the master of his destiny, and that
of so many others, his bosom was thrilled
by an emotion of joy and terror, almost
indescribable; he gazed at it for a while,
and although stimulated by no motive
of vengeance or of cruelty, yet he was
seized with one of those desires which
bewilder the brain, the desire of using
the power which he held, were it only
to see for a moment so many lofty heads
bend humbly before him.</p>

<p>Pierre Couteau gazed at him with
astonishment, and said, roughly:</p>

<p>"Chevalier, this is no time for reflection;
I have other news to announce
to you. Your uncle, the Baron de la
Roque, must now be in Toulouse; my
father, who preceded him by an hour,
has been to your house and found it
closed by the authority of parliament.
He then came to the barracks to inquire
of me where he could find you, for it
seems that the baron has important tidings
for you. I went out in quest of you,
promising to bring you with me to the
hotel D'Espagne, where the baron was
to alight on his arrival. As I passed
your house I found this maiden wandering
around in search of you, and, <i>ma
foi!</i> when she told me she knew not
where to go, I brought her here."</p>

<p>"Alas! yes sir," said Clemence,
"when I had secured this precious casket,
having a presentiment that some
thing was about to happen, I left the

<!-- page 94 col 2 -->

house by a secret door, in order to deposit
it in a safe place. But afraid
to trust it with any of my friends or
relatives, I resolved to carry it to you.
I found your house occupied by the
officers of justice, and not daring to
return home, I entered a church, where
I remained until evening. At last,
forced to leave this asylum, I was on my
way to your house again, when I met
this man who brought me hither."</p>

<p>D'Auterive had listened attentively to
Clemence, whose mild beauty, agitated
as it was with fear and grief, and whose
confiding and simple accent had greatly
interested him, and he replied:</p>

<p>"You cannot remain a moment longer
here. Go hence with this honest soldier,
and wait for me at the corner of the
street&mdash;or rather, follow me; it is better
to fly from this accursed place at once."</p>

<p>He took a step toward the door, and
then paused.</p>

<p>"But the rest?" he thought, "I cannot
leave them in this uncertainty."</p>

<p>He was about to return to them, but he
paused again, muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Yet it were the act of a madman to
enter that chamber again, with the proofs
in my hand; they would cut my throat
without the slightest hesitation; and the
duchess, what would become of her?"</p>

<p>"Chevalier D'Auterive," cried Couteau,
in a tone of alarm, "it seems to me
as if I heard people passing and repassing
before this door."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" said the chevalier, "can
they be spies?"</p>

<p>"It is possible, yet we are strong
enough to escape them; but reflect," added
Pierre Couteau, in a lower tone,
"some one may recognise Mademoiselle
Barati, and her presence in this house
cannot fail to give rise to unpleasant
surmises."</p>

<p>"You are right, Pierre," said the
chevalier, "let us leave this place."</p>

<p>"It is too late!" said a man who now
entered, and closed the door quickly behind
him.</p>

<p>D'Auterive grasped his poignard, and
concealed the casket beneath his mantle;
Pierre Couteau drew his sabre, but both
paused, as they recognised the Baron
de la Roque.</p>

<p>"My uncle!" cried the chevalier.</p>

<!-- page 95 col 1 -->

<p>"Pierre," said the baron quickly;,
"your father Jean Couteau is watching
at a short distance from this house, to see
that no one approach it. Go and join
him, he has the pass-word for those who
ought to enter."</p>

<p>Pierre Couteau left them, and the
Baron de la Roque, turning to his nephew,
said:</p>

<p>"<i>Mordieu!</i> nephew, I did not expect
to find you in this place, and in such
pleasant company, after what I had heard
respecting you. Could you not send
this <i>demoiselle</i> elsewhere? for we have
to discourse of matters more serious than
affairs of gallantry."</p>

<p>"Baron," said the chevalier, addressing
his uncle, "mademoiselle is the
daughter of Barati; a mischance I cannot
explain to you led her hither, and we
were about to leave when you entered."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" said the baron, "the
daughter of Barati! that is another matter;
let her remain, let her remain!"</p>

<p>D'Auterive gazed upon the baron with
astonishment, and at the same time with
the most anxious curiosity. He had
passed the last few hours amid events so
hurried, so extraordinary, that he asked
himself if the baron's presence had not
some reference to that vast association,
the members of which were for the most
part unknown to each other. He hesitated
to put the question, and watched
him as he quietly closed the door and
the windows, barricading all with extreme
care, and displaying an accurate knowledge
of the localities of the house.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, uncle?"</p>

<p>"I am securing us against the visits
of inquisitive persons, for we must be
alone with those who are about to repair
hither, and since mademoiselle is present,
there is no objection to her witnessing
our interview."</p>

<p>The chevalier lowered his voice, and
said to the baron:

"I have no idea of your meaning, sir,
but I feel bound to inform you that there
are a number of people about the
premises who may enter here at any
moment."</p>

<p>The baron gazed at D'Auterive, as if
to divine his thoughts, and said:</p>

<p>"You are pale, nephew; are you terrified
because the parliament has meddled

<!-- page 95 col 2 -->

somewhat with our affairs?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear uncle," replied D'Auterive,
with an air of disdain, "one of those
who are in this house has sent me a
thrust here, which, had it not struck a
rib, would have slain me outright. Although
the wound is not dangerous, yet
the pain and loss of blood have made me
slightly pale."</p>

<p>The baron appeared saddened and surprised,
but his emotion seemed to refer
to something else than the wound which
the chevalier had received.</p>

<p>"One of those who are in this house
has stabbed you?" he rejoined, "what
secret have you betrayed, then?"</p>

<p>"It concerns you, little, uncle; but if
you will be guided by me, you will quit
this house at once, or, at least, suffer me
to leave it with mademoiselle, as this is
scarcely a proper asylum for her."</p>

<p>"That was true," replied the baron,
roughly, "when she was here with such
a mad-cap as you, but my presence is a
sufficient warrant for her. Besides, my
nephew, if the demoiselle here present
is Mademoiselle Barati, as you say, she
might have found twenty other more
suitable places to which she could have
retired, after her father's arrest. She
must have been led here, therefore, by
motives of which I wish to be informed."</p>

<p>"M. de la Roque, this maiden is under
my protection, and notwithstanding
the respect I owe you, I will not suffer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gently, gently! my nephew," said
the baron, casting a peculiar glance
upon the chevalier, "do not shout so
loud; you are acquainted, perhaps, with
the adage of the Arabs: <i>Speech is silver,
but silence is gold</i>."</p>

<p>D'Auterive started backward, and returning
the baron's glance, he reached
him his open hand, and replied:</p>

<p>"Without doubt; but the hour is
coming, when the adage may be reversed,
when we can say that speech is gold."</p>

<p>"The hour has come!" cried the baron,
warmly, as he struck the palm of his
hand in that of his nephew's, "all the
members of the association will be here
in an hour. We can now strike the decisive
blow."</p>

<p>D'Auterive did not seem to understand
him, but the baron continued:</p>

<p>"All that we needed was money.

<!-- page 96 col 1 -->

Well, now, my nephew, we have it, in
sacks, in barrels, in mountains. The
vaults of La Roque are filled with it;
we will all start this night for the mountain,
and will carry off as much as we
can, and with that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The baron darted a triumphant glance
toward the ceiling, and D'Auterive, who
referred his words to the society of
counterfeiters, was convinced anew that
the baron was a member of the association.</p>

<p>The latter, almost wild with joy, cried
suddenly:</p>

<p>"And those above, are they in the business?"</p>

<p>"All," said the chevalier.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur Duke de Nevers, the
Duchess, Monseigneur the Bishop de St.
Croix&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" cried the baron,
"the Duke&mdash;the Bishop de St. Croix&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, it is true, they are of
higher rank than we, but we are of the
old noblesse as well as they, and they
might very well belong to the association
of which we are members."</p>

<p>"We are talking Greek, nephew; they
have not the same interest that we have;
the Duke de Nevers, and above all, the
Bishop de St. Croix would burn us alive
if they suspected the truth."</p>

<p>"What do you say, uncle? burn us
alive? If such a punishment were reserved
for such a crime, they would be
the first to mount the pile."</p>

<p>"No, no, far from it; they are men
who know how to take their precautions.
If the affair succeeds, they will reap the
lion's share, and if it fails, we shall have
to pay for the broken dishes."</p>

<p>"There is no fear of that, uncle; I
hold in my hands the proofs of their
participation of the crime, and now that
the affair is discovered, they must save
us or perish with us."</p>

<p>"What is that? the affair discovered!
Why, what evidence have you of that?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> Why, Barati's arrest."</p>

<p>"That is no proof."</p>

<p>"I know it; but they suspect him."</p>

<p>"I comprehend; his conduct in parliament
at the time of the revocation of
the edict of Nantes."</p>

<p>"Why, we are talking Hebrew now,

<!-- page 96 col 2 -->

uncle. What the devil has the revocation
of the edict of Nantes to do with all
this?"</p>

<p>The baron gazed at his nephew with
stupefaction and distrust, and said:</p>

<p>"Among the men who are above, are
there none of the reformed faith?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, uncle," replied D'Auterive,
"I think that religion has nothing to do
with this affair; so far as I know, they
are all good catholics."</p>

<p>"In that case, nephew, we are talking
neither Greek nor Hebrew; we do not
understand each other at all."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, uncle," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"But then, why are you here?"</p>

<p>"Will you permit me, uncle, to inquire
first the cause of your presence?"</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a traitor, chevalier?"</p>

<p>"I was about to ask you the same
question."</p>

<p>At this moment Rosine appeared at
the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Chevalier, they are growing impatient
above; you must resolve upon
something. Go hence, it is the most
prudent course, for the duke maintains
that it is safest to despatch you upon the
spot, happen what may."</p>

<p>"You are right, my child," said the
chevalier; "but reassure the duchess, tell
her that I possess the papers in question,
and that she need not be uneasy, about
the duke's anger."</p>

<p>"By all the saints!" cried the duke,
who had followed Rosine, and who now
rushed into the chamber, sword in hand,
"you shall not quit us thus, M. D'Auterive!"</p>

<p>"By all the devils!" said the Bishop
de St. Croix, advancing in his turn, "we
must have the papers."</p>

<p>The chevalier, finding himself no
longer unsupported, and sure of being
able to summon Jean and Pierre Couteau
to his assistance, thought it the best
course for himself and his accomplices,
to destroy all traces of their association,
by placing the casket in the hands of the
duke.</p>

<p>"Here is that," he said to him, "which
will save you, and which ought to save
us all&mdash;all, do you understand me, monseigneur,
and, forget not, that if a single

<!-- page 97 col 1 -->

person is forgotten in the general pardon,
should it cost me my life, I will have
vengeance."</p>

<p>"All that has been arranged by a
better mediator than yourself," said the
duke. "M. de St. Croix is one to whom
I can listen. He has my promise."</p>

<p>The bishop gave a sign of assent.</p>

<p>"Despatch, brother!" he said, at the
same time, "let us destroy these papers."</p>

<p>"Rosine," said the duke, "bring a
brazier, and inform the persons who are
above that we hold our safety in our
hands, and that they are entitled to be
present at the ceremony."</p>

<p>In the mean while, the baron had approached
the chevalier, and had said to
him in a low voice:</p>

<p>"By my soul, I could never have believed
that the duke was concerned in
the business."</p>

<p>"He, and many others, uncle."</p>

<p>"M. de la Roque also!" cried the
duke, with a joyous air, "why, all the
province is engaged in the affair; <i>ma foi</i>,
baron, I had imagined they had dispensed
with you, and had taken possession
of your castle without your suspecting
it."</p>

<p>The baron assumed an air of suspicion,
and his nephew, who, notwithstanding
the gay bearing of the duke, feared
some error and some mischance, said to
him in an under tone:</p>

<p>"Be silent!"</p>

<p>"But <i>mordieu!</i>" cried the duke, "who
is that young girl concealed in the corner
yonder?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," said D'Auterive
quickly, "it is to her that we all owe
our safety, it was she who removed the
papers from her father's house."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Barati!" exclaimed
the duke.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Barati; she came here
to place these papers in my hands."</p>

<p>The duke's brow lowered.</p>

<p>"Chevalier, she knows more than she
should, methinks."</p>

<p>"Her father's life is in our hands,"
said the baron, "and I will answer for
her silence."</p>

<p>"True, true; but here is the duchess,
my brother, M. de Frias, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M. de Frias living!" cried the baron,
starting backward.</p>

<!-- page 97 col 2 -->

<p>"The Baron de la Roque here!" exclaimed
M. de Fries.</p>

<p>These exclamations were at first
drowned by the voice of the duke, who
continued to announce the persons as
they entered, but probably an explanation
would have followed immediately,
when a knock at the outer door threw
the assembly into a state of anxious suspense.</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque alone spoke:</p>

<p>"It is Jean Couteau," he said, "it is a
friend and brother."</p>

<p>He stepped to the door, and Jean Couteau
thrust in his head, and speaking in
a low voice, said:</p>

<p>"There is a group of seven or eight
persons without, who demand to be admitted;
they have repeated the password:
'<i>Speech is silver, but silence is
gold</i>.' "</p>

<p>"It is the rest of the band," said the
duke; "let them enter. I confess I am
anxious to see all our comrades, and,
above all, to know the one who has so
cunningly knotted this association that he
alone was master of us all."</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque, who stood at
the door, admitted five or six men, one
after other. The first who entered, on
perceiving the duke, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Treason!" and he placed his hand
upon his sword.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the duke, laughing, "M.
de Lancy! <i>Pardieu!</i> for a man of the
religion which attacks the morality of
our holy faith, you seem to have made a
good bargain of your principles."</p>

<p>Others now entered; the duke called
them all by name, jesting pleasantly
with each one, while they gathered
around M. de la Roque, and said to him.
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have not led us
into a snare?"</p>

<p>"At all events," replied the baron,
"we are armed, and as numerous as
they are, and we shall see if they will
take us as easily as they think. Besides,
he holds the deed of our association, and
it is much better that D'Auterive should
have given it to him here, than in his
palace."</p>

<p>"Silence, gentlemen!" cried the duke,
"do not let us keep up the force among
ourselves, I beg you; what is done, is

<!-- page 98 col 1 -->

done. And since the affair is discovered,
it is better to finish matters, and
protect ourselves against treachery, by
destroying these 'papers.' "</p>

<p>While the duke spoke, he placed the
casket upon the table, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Par l'enfer!</i> this casket has been
opened, the seal is broken!"</p>

<p>"What matters it?" said the Bishop
de St. Croix, "if the lock is uninjured,
and the papers are found in it. It is an
accident."</p>

<p>The duke, with the aid of his poignard,
forced the lock, and beheld a book,
each leaf of which was folded and sealed.
He held it up, and showing it to all
present, said:</p>

<p>"Here it is, gentlemen! do you recognise
it?"</p>

<p>The book was enclosed in a covering,
upon which were drawn various hieroglyphics.
All present crowded around
it, and the new comers as well as the
rest, declared that it was in a similar
book that they had inscribed their signatures.</p>

<p>The duke still held it in his hands,
and slightly opening the first leaf, he
said:</p>

<p>"You know, gentlemen, that in case
of a dissolution of the society, whether
by the general will, or on account of
outward constraint, the deed itself regulates
the division of the sums which
belong to the society."</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque and his friends
gazed at each other with an air of wonder
as they heard these words. A sudden
thought seemed to strike the baron,
and he muttered in a low voice:</p>

<p>"They are the men!"</p>

<p>The duke now cast his eyes upon
the page which contained, as he said,
these regulations. Scarcely had he
read a line, when he exclaimed in a
voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"What is this! a deed of association
to profit by the death of the king, and
the disposition of the regent to re-establish
the reformed religion! A plot
against the state, gentlemen! a crime!"</p>

<p>At these words M. de la Roque and those
of his party grouped themselves in a corner,
while the baron, who, from his conversation
with D'Auterive, suspected that
the duke was entangled in some serious

<!-- page 98 col 2 -->

affair, and who, from his words concerning
the division to be made, had in part
divined its nature, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What did you think to find in this
casket then, monseigneur? Ah! it
was the deed of an association of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, for heaven's sake!" said
D'Auterive, who was now convinced
that the baron, having discovered what
was passing in the vast vaults beneath
the castle, had resolved to apply the
wealth of the counterfeiters to the accomplishment
of the plot of the Protestants.</p>

<p>"Lay down your arms!" cried the
duke, "lay down your arms! You are
my prisoners!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," they responded, unsheathing
their swords.</p>

<p>"M. D'Auterive," said the duke,
drawing his weapon, "I demand your
aid; I will look upon each one as a rebel
who refuses to assist me in securing
these traitors!"</p>

<p>In the warmth of his zeal and hatred
against the protestants, and his eagerness
to chastise them, the duke forgot
his own safety, and a sanguinary struggle
was about to commence, when suddenly
the door was thrown open with
violence, and Jean Couteau, pale, agitated,
and trembling, rushed into the
chamber, and pointing toward the door,
said, in a broken, stifled voice:</p>

<p>"There he comes! here he is!"</p>

<p>"Who?" cried all present, apparently
with equal terror.</p>

<p>"He! the dead man! the sorcerer
Pastourel!"</p>

<p>At the same moment, the shepherd,
with whom our readers are acquainted
under the name of Pastourel, made his
appearance. He was clothed in a
brown riding hood, and he bore his iron
pointed staff, upon which he leaned; he
then cast a mild glance upon all
present.</p>

<p>The duke started with terror, as he
beheld the pale face of the shepherd,
and some exclamation would doubtless
have betrayed the secret of his alarm,
when Pastourel made a sign which imposed
silence upon him. Then in a
calm, but authoritative voice, he said:</p>

<p>"Return your swords to their scabbards,
gentlemen! Rosine, bring hither

<!-- page 99 col 1 -->

the brazier. Monseigneur, cast into it
the papers which you hold."</p>

<p>The duke hesitated. Pastourel drew
from beneath his mantle, a casket resembling
that which had been placed in
the hands of the duke, and took from it
a book, the envelope of which was exactly
similar to the former. At this sight
the duke obeyed, and Pastourel imitating
him, cast also into the brazier the
register which he had brought.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said while the deeds
were burning, "there is no longer any
crime, either on the one side or on the
other. Monseigneur, you have heard
nothing; Baron de la Roque, you have
divined nothing."</p>

<p>"Be it so!" said the duke.</p>

<p>"Willingly!" said the baron.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," resumed Pastourel,
addressing the others, "retire with the
most perfect confidence as to the results
of this affair; every trace is effaced."</p>

<p>"Are you certain?" said the duke
respectfully.</p>

<p>"I assure you of it."</p>

<p>"How the devil," cried the baron,
"would you have me trust to the word
of a keeper of sheep?"</p>

<p>"Comte de Frias," said Pastourel,
"tell this man that he may trust me."</p>

<p>"I think he will do so," said the comte,
"when I conjure him by that hospitality
which he offered me so strangely fifteen
years ago.</p>

<p>"You are right," said the baron, casting
his eyes to the ground. "But, <i>pardieu</i>,
should it cost me my head, I will
know the mystery of that vision, which
I beheld night before last in my castle."</p>

<p>"Do not wish to know it," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"I have said that I would venture my
head! Besides, if the matter is not explained,
I should never dare to enter my
dwelling again."</p>

<p>"You will never enter it again; the
castle of La Roque is burned to the
ground."</p>

<p>"My castle burned!" cried the baron,
"Who has done the deed? who has
despoiled me of my sole remaining
wealth?"</p>

<p>"Who could thus destroy the vast riches
which were still buried in its vaults?"
exclaimed the duke.</p>

<!-- page 99 col 2 -->

<p>"I!" said Pastourel, "and when you
hear the reason, you will both thank
me. The parliament can send thither
now, if it will; it will find there neither
the arms and munitions which you have
collected there, gentlemen of the reformed
faith, nor the machines which
you used to coin false money, gentlemen
of the <i>noblesse</i>. Leave me, sirs, with
the duke and M. de la Roque; we have
some matters yet to arrange together."</p>

<p>Then turning to each one in particular;
he said, first to D'Auterive:</p>

<p>"M. D'Auterive, you can escort
Mademoiselle Barati to her father's
house; he will soon be set at liberty,
for there is no one to support an accusation
against him. Monseigneur de
St. Croix, it is necessary that you should
be to-morrow in your palace which you
have not left. Comte de Frias, your son
is waiting to embark with you."</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute;!" cried the baron, "no,
no! we have a bloody account to
settle."</p>

<p>"M. D'Auterive," resumed Pastourel,
casting a threatening glance upon
the baron, "the duty which I impose
upon you once fulfilled, I counsel you to
profit by the permission which the Duke
de Nevers grants you, to travel in foreign
lands."</p>

<p>Then approaching the duchess, he
said:</p>

<p>"Madam, you are expected at your
palace; you will there give orders for
a grand festival, which will take place
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The duchess, who had not taken her
eyes from Pastourel since he had entered,
said to him submissively, and in
a low voice:</p>

<p>"Be it so, sir! be it so! but afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Do that which God inspires you to
do!" replied Pastourel.</p>

<p>All present having left the house after
having thus received a command, or
word of counsel from the mouth of Pastourel,
he remained alone with the
Baron de la Roque and the Duke de
Nevers. Their interview lasted until
morning.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE RUINS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will avail ourselves once more of
the privilege of the novelist, to overleap
time as we have overleaped space, and
will return to the old castle of La Roque,
or rather to its ruins. Sixteen years had
elapsed, since the day when the two associations
of which we have spoken, had
been so suddenly dissolved, and the memory
of this circumstance was entirely forgotten.
The noise of the accusation
entered by M. de Fourvi&egrave;res, had in
truth been spread abroad among the
people, but the result of the search set
on foot by parliament, in the dwellings of
Barati and of D'Auterive had caused
this accusation to be considered as an
illusion emanating from the president's
brain, and the secret information lodged
against them, as the trick of some malicious
intermeddler. The burning of
the castle of La Roque, occurring, as it
did, immediately upon this accusation,
had at first appeared as a proof of the
reality of the supposed crime; but
when it was known that the castle had
been surprised, sacked and burned by
the shepherds of the mountain, the deed
was viewed as an act of vengeance
against the persecutions which the
baron had inflicted upon the clothiers
of Lavelanet; and whether some higher
authority, or some secret influence had
checked the ardor of the parliament in
investigating this affair, the inquest was
followed by no results; besides this, it
was for the interest of too many individuals
that the business should be forgotten.
Vague accusations had been
current, insinuations had been aimed at
persons of even higher authority than the
Duke de Nevers, and were whispered in
some circles of the parliament, hints of
sorcery of apparitions were mingled with
these rumors, until after the lapse of a few
years, naught remained but a remembrance
so indistinct, that no one could
tell what in reality had occurred.</p>

<p>The greater part of the principal actors
in the scene, had one by one disappeared.
Thus, nothing had since been
heard of the Comte de Frias, or of his
son, Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<!-- page 100 col 2 -->

<p>The Duke de Nevers, after having
resigned his government, had returned
to Paris. But as there were at that time
no gazettes to announce the receptions
given daily by the king or by the regent,
it was not till long afterward, that it was
known that the duchess had not reappeared.</p>

<p>On the other side, Barati, after having
resumed his seat in the parliament, had
by degrees sold all the property that he
possessed; at the end of a year he had
resigned his place as councillor, and had
left Toulouse with his daughter Clemence.
It was known also, that he had
returned to Paris, but he had so well
concealed himself, that nothing had since
been heard of him.</p>

<p>It was known likewise in the country,
that D'Auterive had inherited some
estates, with the title of comte, which
had been bequeathed to him by a great
uncle on his mother's side; that he was
attached to the royal household, and
had married, but no one could tell the
name of the woman who was his wife.</p>

<p>The only person who had not left the
country, was the Baron de la Roque.&mdash;Still
he had not returned to La Roque,
as he had at first intended; neither had
he rebuilt his castle on the spot where
the former one had stood. His new
abode was situated about half a league
from the old one, and in a spot much
less wild and romantic. It was still indeed
the mansion of a seigneur, with his
seignorial rights displayed and verified
in stone; at each angle of the vast
structure stood a turret, but one of these
turrets enclosed a private stairway, the
three others served as store-houses for
fruit and grain. Wide ditches had been
dug along the main front of the modern
castle, but they were bordered with fruit
trees and planted with vegetables.</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque was blind.
His daughter Charlotte tended him with
a devotion, which the singular humor of
the old man did not altogether appreciate.</p>

<p>As to Charlotte's mother, the Baroness
de la Roque, she had also disappeared,
although the place of her retreat was
known.</p>

<p>Galidou, accused of having been the
first instigator of the burning of the castle,
had withdrawn into Spain, and his

<!-- page 101 col 1 -->

father never appeared to concern himself
about his fate.</p>

<p>Old Gali was dead, and his daughter
Catharine, having inherited all his property,
had espoused Pierre Couteau,
whose military air had fascinated her.</p>

<p>As for old Jean Couteau, he lived with
his son, whose flocks he drove to pasture
upon the mountain, for Pierre still carried
on the commerce in wool and cloths
established by his father-in-law.</p>

<p>But never, not for any price, could
Jean Couteau be induced to drive his
flocks to the pasturage where he had
seen Pastourel lying wounded upon the
earth, and when any necessary errand
led him in sight of the ruins of the old
castle, he passed them trembling and defending
himself against all evil influences
by making the sign of the cross, and
uttering the most fervent prayers.</p>

<p>We will be more courageous than
Jean Couteau, and will accompany to
these ruins, a cavalier of from twenty-eight
to thirty years, who repaired thither
without being in the slightest degree intimidated
by the bad repute of the spot.</p>

<p>The day was beginning to dawn, and
the sun was already upon the edge of
the horizon, when our young man, after
having fastened the bridle of his horse
to the branch of a tree, crossed the tottering
remnants of the drawbridge,
and boldly entered the court. He
reached a low gate, ascended a few steps,
and found himself in a vaulted hall,
which had been spared by the conflagration.</p>

<p>A man who had reached the verge of
extreme old age, was here seated upon
a tolerably comfortable bed. Books,
mathematical instruments, a furnace and
alembics adorned this apartment.</p>

<p>When the youth entered, the old man
saluted him with a gesture of his hand,
and continued to read in a folio which he
held upon his knees.</p>

<p>The youth, familiar, doubtless, with
the habits of the old man, signed to him
not to disturb himself, and commenced
playing with a large mountain dog,
which was lying in one corner of the
hall. The dog approached to fawn upon
him, and the young man, taking the animal's
head in his hands, and reaching

<!-- page 101 col 2 -->

him a handkerchief, said, as if the dog
could understand him:</p>

<p>"Smell it well, smell this handkerchief,
Greyfoot, smell it well, and if ever
a being that exhales this sweet and perfumed
odor, visits these ruins, do not
bite her, do you hear?"</p>

<p>The dog, as if he had comprehended
him, smelt the handkerchief, took it in
his mouth, and having tossed it into the
air and caught it again, he brought it to
the young man. The latter took it from
his jaws, and added:</p>

<p>" 'Tis well, Greyfoot, 'tis well! for
you are large enough to frighten one
more fearless than a young girl. Smell
it, smell it!"</p>

<p>The dog smelt the handkerchief once
more, wagged his tail, and then approached
the old man, who had closed
his book. The Solitary had crossed
himself after he had finished reading, a
proof that, notwithstanding his strange
abode, and the singular instruments with
which it was furnished, he meddled with
no cabalistic and damnable arts; he
turned toward the young man, and said
with a mild and firm voice:</p>

<p>"Well, Bernard! what news?"</p>

<p>"All is going worse and worse, master
Pastourel! worse and worse! The
Comte D'Auterive arrived last night, and
instead of stopping to lodge at his uncle,
Baron de la Roque's, he has ridden on to
the manor of Saint-Quintin, which was
purchased lately by that adventurer,
who calls himself the Marquis of Veroni,
a title that I thought extinct with the
last prince of Puzzano, who, as you
know, was burned forty years ago upon
the Chiaia at Naples, for the crime of
sorcery."</p>

<p>"What reason have you, Bernard,"
replied the old man, with emotion, "for
doubting the rights of this stranger to
bear the title of Marquis of Veroni?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, on account of what
I have just told you, master Pastourel,
and then the fellow murders the Italian
like a Swiss pedlar, chatters French like
a Toulousian, and speaks the dialect of
this province admirably."</p>

<p>"If you judged wisely, Bernard," replied
Pastourel, "you would see in all
this, so many proofs that he has a right
to the title, for if he is in any way the true

<!-- page 102 col 1 -->

descendant of the prince of Puzzano,
he has been abandoned to neglect and
exile, and his education cannot have been
as carefully attended to as yours, Marquis
de Velay: but it concerns you little
to know what he is."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, <i>pardieu!</i> it concerns
me much! In the first place, because
he visits the baron's far too often,
and then because, in spite of his forty
years, well told, although he pretends
to be but thirty-six, he pays his court to
Charlotte in a manner that does not
please me at all."</p>

<p>"Are you jealous to this degree?"</p>

<p>"Jealous of every body, master Pastourel,
even of that other adventurer,
who calls himself Vasconcellos, and who,
notwithstanding his gallows face, is forever
hovering about the outskirts of the
baron's manor."</p>

<p>"Has he been admitted there?" said
the old man with some disquietude.</p>

<p>"He tried it once, and announced
himself to the old baron as a neighbor,
who wished to make his acquaintance.
I cannot tell you the effect that the voice
of this Vasconcellos, produced upon the
old man, but it seemed, as if the baron
strove to pierce the darkness which surrounded
him, and he so overwhelmed
the said Portuguese with questions, that
the latter, after answering at random,
withdrew, and since that he has never
visited the castle, except at the hour
when the baron takes his afternoon's
siesta, from which the explosion of a
thousand guns about his ears, would not
arouse him."</p>

<p>"So, then!" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Every day at two o'clock, the baron
is drunk as a beast, and snores like an
organ pipe; now, Vasconcellos, in choosing
this hour, seems to me, to sin against
all the rules of good breeding, and I
would have quarrelled with Charlotte
about it more than twenty times, if at the
first she had not said to me, "it <i>must</i> be
so!"</p>

<p>"She is right" said Pastourel, "and
you do well to believe her."</p>

<p>"The devil take me if I do believe
her!" replied the young Marquis de Velay,
rising; "I think it must <i>not</i> be so;
but when Charlotte, with that sweet
smile, which pierces the very depths of

<!-- page 102 col 2 -->

my heart, or with that imperious glance,
which thrills me through and through,
says "it must!" I obey&mdash;I obey, like a
simpleton, and still that must have an
end, and it will soon be my turn to say,
"it must!" and if she does not obey me
as I have obeyed her, why, she is deceiving
me, she does not love me."</p>

<p>"And what is this command which
Charlotte must obey, if she would prove
that she love you?"</p>

<p>Young Bernard shrugged his shoulders,
and replied:</p>

<p>"A command to Charlotte! it would
be enough to banish me forever; it will
be a prayer, Pastourel, and a prayer as
humble as a man can offer."</p>

<p>"And what will this prayer require
of her, Bernard?"</p>

<p>"To follow me to Spain, if, as I anticipate,
the Comte D'Auterive does not
bring my father's consent to our marriage."</p>

<p>"And why do you suppose that this
consent will be refused?"</p>

<p>"For an excellent reason; because it
has been once refused already."</p>

<p>"True, but at the second request
which you addressed to him, did not
your father, the Duke de Nevers, answer,
that he would send the Comte
D'Auterive, with full powers, to settle
this affair? What do you find alarming
in this?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, I do not understand
this choice which he has made of
the Comte D'Auterive; he is a perfect
stranger to my family; in the next, because
he comes here with his wife."</p>

<p>"What matters that?"</p>

<p>"She leads him by the nose."</p>

<p>"And what matters that?"</p>

<p>"What matters that? Why, it is necessary
that this marriage should please
the comtesse, and I fear that it will not."</p>

<p>"And wherefore, Bernard?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> the boors of this district
are great fools to take you for a sorcerer,
if you cannot guess wherefore this marriage
will not please the comtesse."</p>

<p>A gleam of joy passed across the
withered face of the old man; and he said:</p>

<p>"Pah! the Comtesse D'Auterive!"</p>

<p>"She is, with her thirty years, the
most enticing, hare-brained, capricious,
petulant woman imaginable."</p>

<!-- page 103 col 1 -->

<p>A hollow, smothered laugh escaped
from Pastourel's lips, and he muttered:
"oh, it is heaven's vengeance!" but the
next moment, he appeared to repent him
of this ebullition, and he added, in a
meek and serious tone:</p>

<p>"Her own safety will induce her not
to evince too much obstinacy, or the
comte might suspect the motive of her
opposition?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you have no idea of Clemence,"
said Bernard. "One would think her a
duchess, who had espoused a boor, and
governed him at her will. One would
never have expected to see D'Auterive
tremble thus before his wife, especially
when it is he who has married beneath
his rank, in choosing the daughter, of
that pedant Barati, who heaps up farthings
upon crowns, and pence upon
livres, in a garret, in the Rue de la
Huchette, at Paris."</p>

<p>"He has become a complete miser, as
the baron has become a complete drunkard,"
muttered Pastourel. "Vice is
like the poison of Brabantio; when it attacks
a man, it eats into the very marrow
of his bones."</p>

<p>"Do not talk of poison, Pastourel, for
I fear that all your skill as a sorcerer,
consists in the art of compounding poisons."</p>

<p>If the light which penetrated this
vaulted hall, had been more vivid, the
young Marquis de Velay would have
observed that Pastourel turned pale, but
the youth spoke like a heedless man
who gives utterance to a thoughtless
word, rather than a real suspicion, and
Pastourel replied:</p>

<p>"So, then, you fear the influence of the
Comtesse D'Auterive?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am convinced that it is she,
who has prevented her husband from
alighting at the baron's, as was most natural
and proper."</p>

<p>"I do not see," replied Pastourel,
"why she should manifest any eagerness,
to lodge in the dwelling of a rival."</p>

<p>"But why," said Bernard, "has she
chosen the dwelling of this Marquis of
Veroni, who is in no wise entitled to her
esteem?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> cried the marquis, "I
should be delighted to hear that they really

<!-- page 103 col 2 -->

fancied one another, and that the vaporing
airs of the marquis had fascinated
the comtesse."</p>

<p>"It is scarcely probable as to the past,
for I think that they have never met before."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Let it suffice that I know it. And
have you any thing else to tell me?"</p>

<p>"One thing, and a very strange thing;
in truth. Charlotte intends paying you
a visit. I was not so much surprised at
that, for every woman is curious to see
a sorcerer; but what astonishes me is
this, she intends to come hither alone,
and she has plainly told me, that if I attempt
to follow her, all our intercourse
is at an end, and she will never see me
again in her life."</p>

<p>"Are you jealous of me, as well as of
Veroni and Vasconcellos?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mio Padre</i>," said the marquis in a
singular tone, "<i>mio carissimo padre</i>, I
know too well what trade you ply; why,
you are the general confidant of all the
inhabitants of this district, and there is
not a soul of them, but comes to consult
you, when he is at a loss how to extricate
himself from some embarrassing
affair. I have seen Veroni and Vasconcellos
come here, and that has not surprised
me, for I imagine that they are
both troubled by some past action, which
neither the one nor the other has ever
entrusted to mortal ear, but I am surprised
and terrified at the thought that
Charlotte should have need of any counsel
from you. The devil fly away with
me, if it is for any honest matter, for I
myself have given her the only good
advice that a young girl can listen to&mdash;if
my father consents, we will marry&mdash;if
he refuses, we will elope&mdash;that is all
plain and proper."</p>

<p>"In your first counsel," replied Pastourel,
"there is one thing that you have
entirely forgotten, that is, that if your
father consent, it is necessary that the
baron should consent likewise."</p>

<p>"Hem!" said the Marquis de Velay,
"it seems to me, that it is too
great an honor for the old drunkard, and
that he will kiss my hands, when I tell
him that his daughter will one day be
the Duchess de Nevers."</p>

<p>"Sir Marquis de Velay, future Duke

<!-- page 104 col 1 -->

de Nevers," replied Pastourel, "you
are too presumptuous; the baron will
refuse."</p>

<p>"In that case, I will carry her off."</p>

<p>"Charlotte will refuse, notwithstanding
the propriety of the counsel which
you have given her."</p>

<p>"Ha! every thing conspires, then,
against my happiness!"</p>

<p>"Every thing, and you more than
all."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"By conducting yourself like the
loftiest seigneur that it has ever been my
chance to meet with; by imagining that
you do too much honor to the daughter
of the Baron de la Roque, in demanding
her hand, and by treating this Vasconcellos
and this Veroni, who are most
certainly your equals, as adventurers;
by your suspicion of Charlotte, who is a
model of virtue, and by speaking with
such levity to a man whom you ought
to respect."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> for the few bags of gold
which you have lent me, old sorcerer,
you are growing very impertinent," said
the marquis, cutting the air with the riding
whip which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Par l'enfer!</i>" cried the old man,
rising from his bed, and displaying his
lofty stature; "were it not for some
blood which flows in thy veins, that
word would have cost thee thy life."</p>

<p>The young man dropped his eyes before
the piercing glance of Pastourel,
and said in a humble tone:</p>

<p>"I was wrong; well then&mdash;yes I was
wrong! but I have not told you all."</p>

<p>"What? is there more?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday, on arriving at the castle
of La Roque, I inquired after Charlotte;
they told me she was in the garden with
Vasconcellos. That put me out of humor.
Well, at the corner of an alley,
I heard persons talking together, behind
a row of trees, and I recognised the
voices of Charlotte and Vasconcellos.&mdash;The
opportunity was a good one&mdash;I approached
to listen, and may the devil
confound me, if I did not hear the sound
of a kiss."</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Possible?" cried the marquis.&mdash;"She
is guilty then, and it was so: I was
not deceived?"</p>

<!-- page 104 col 2 -->

<p>"Did you not hear it?"</p>

<p>"I imagined I heard it, but if I had
been sure, I would have passed my
sword through Vasconcellos' body. But
the wind stirred the trees, and I thought
I might be mistaken. I approached still
nearer; they heard me, and when Charlotte
turned her face towards me, her
features were so calm, her glance so
confident, that I was ashamed of my
suspicion. But may the devil strangle
me if it did not sound like a kiss, only
there was no blushing, no confusion, no
emotion, but this accursed sound has
been ringing in my ears ever since. I
must finish with this Vasconcellos."</p>

<p>"I have forbidden you to speak to
him; a single rash act, and your happiness
is destroyed!"</p>

<p>"Ever the same threat!" said the
marquis. "I have been led long enough&mdash;yes,
long enough by your counsels;
I will free myself from this yoke&mdash;I will
act in my own way&mdash;I have need of you
no longer."</p>

<p>"Why have you come hither then,"
said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>mon dieu!</i> I have come to tell
you that Charlotte will pay you a visit
to-night."</p>

<p>"You did her errand, notwithstanding
your suspicions?"</p>

<p>"What in the devil's name, would
you have me do?" replied Bernard, "she
begged me to come."</p>

<p>"And you obeyed?"</p>

<p>Bernard assumed a melancholy air.</p>

<p>"Stay, old sorcerer!" he said, "you
are mocking me, and justly; but what
would you! I love her! Why? how?
I cannot say. She told me to come, and
I have come. On the way hither I said
that I was a fool, but I have come notwithstanding,
and when you have told
me the hour at which you will expect
her, I shall return and bear back your
answer, more obedient than your dog
Greyfoot. So then, let us hear, despatch!
tell me at what hour she can
see you."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you yet," replied Pastourel,
"that will depend upon the hour
at which Comte D'Auterive will visit me
to-day."</p>

<p>"The comte is coming here?" cried
Bernard in astonishment.</p>

<!-- page 105 col 1 -->

<p>"Did he not arrive last evening?"
said Pastourel, gravely.</p>

<p>"And the comtesse," said the marquis,
affecting a sneer, "perhaps she will
come also."</p>

<p>"It will be necessary for her to decide
to do so," replied the old man in the
same tone.</p>

<p>Bernard stood speechless for a moment;
Pastourel's assurance confounded
him. If the old man's words should
actually prove true, he might place some
confidence in him, he thought; although
far from being inclined to believe in sorcery,
yet he said to himself, "if I see
the comte come first to these ruins, and
then the comtesse, I will sell my soul to
the old fellow, were he the devil in person,
to obtain possession of Charlotte."</p>

<p>The young lover had not finished his
reflections on this subject, when Greyfoot
began to whine and bark joyfully, wagging
his tail, and at the same time a female
of about thirty-five years, tall and
slender, with a well turned foot and ankle,
a figure still elegant, and clothed in the
costume of a peasant girl of the richer
class, entered in haste, and threw herself
breathless upon the arm chair,
which a moment before had been occupied
by the Marquis de Velay.</p>

<p>"Well, Catharine Couteau," said Pastourel,
"what news? I expected to see
your husband."</p>

<p>"Ah, in truth," said Catharine in a
shrill voice, "he has not the courage for
that. I do not know what my good father-in-law
has put into his head, but
Pierre has grown as timid as a lamb; he
still goes up the mountain," she added,
turning proudly to Bernard, who had begun
to laugh, "and if he meets a wolf
there, or a bear, or a man, even if this
man wears a sword at his side, he will
not wink; but speak to him of approaching
these ruins, and he trembles and
turns as pale as a sheet. Old Jean
maintains that you are a spectre and a
sorcerer, and Pierre believes his father
as he believes the Gospel. But I, who
believe neither the old man nor my husband,
I have come to tell you the news,
although they have both forbidden me to
do it."</p>

<p>"Pierre likewise?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, before his father's face,

<!-- page 105 col 2 -->

for he is terribly afraid of him, as if he
were still young enough for the whip;
but no sooner had the old man turned his
back, than he told me to go as far as the
torrent, to see if our woodcutters were
at their work: he brought me my mantle
after he had wrapped a rosary in it,
and he knew well enough, the good man,
that I would not stop at the torrent."</p>

<p>"He knows you, Catharine."</p>

<p>"And I know him," replied the latter,
"he will not ask me where I went, but
he will burn to know it, and I will not
say a word of the matter."</p>

<p>"You will tell him, my child," said
Pastourel, smiling. "A woman should
not have any secrets from her husband."</p>

<p>"Bah! bah!" replied Catharine, with
a singular air, "if Pierre is inquisitive,
I am not talkative."</p>

<p>Bernard laughed again, and said:
"Poor Pierre!"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! sir marquis," cried Catharine,
"marry Mademoiselle de la Roque,
and after fifteen years of wedlock, you
will have your little secrets, forsooth;
unless you do like others that we know,
who have not waited so long as that."</p>

<p>Bernard blushed at these words, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What means this impertinent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" said Pastourel, "Catharine
is right perhaps, but that is not the
question now; I wish to hear the news
she brings me, and it must be very important,
for she is quite out of breath."</p>

<p>"It is not the news that puts me out
of breath, for it is not so very pressing;
but then," she added, lowering her voice,
"I met something strange."</p>

<p>"Have you met a magpie or a
monk?" said Bernard.</p>

<p>"Neither magpie, nor monk, nor marquis,"
replied Catharine. "What I met
was a man dressed all in black, with a
yellow face, hollow, flaming eyes, like a
light in a lantern, and long withered
hands; a true phantom of parchment,
dressed in serge; he stopped me at the
border of the torrent, and said in a hollow
voice:</p>

<p>" 'These are the ruins of the castle of
La Roque, are they not?'</p>

<p>"I was so frightened that I answered
him with a curtesy.</p>

<p>"Then he added:</p>

<!-- page 106 col 1 -->

<p>" 'Is there not a man there called Pastourel?'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, yes,' I said.</p>

<p>" 'Well then,' he answered, 'tell him
that I will visit him to-night:' "</p>

<p>At this news Pastourel seemed so astonished,
that Bernard, who watched his
features, saw at once that the sorcerer's
science was completely at fault. Pastourel
observed it, and wishing to restore
Bernard to the state of uncertainty in
which he had left him a moment since,
as to the extent of his power, he replied:</p>

<p>"He has arrived sooner than I
thought."</p>

<p>He then examined a sphere, and added:</p>

<p>"I have neglected this inclination by
the thousandth part of a degree. I was
wrong by a day."</p>

<p>Catharine clasped her rosary in her
hands; but Bernard, equally astonished
with the peasant woman, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And who is this man whom you expect!
You must know him."</p>

<p>"He wishes to remain unknown,"</p>

<p>Bernard was about to reply, but Catharine
at once exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is true, for I asked him his name,
and he said, 'I will disclose it to Pastourel.'
The man frightened me, and
not wishing to leave you alone with him,
I proposed that he should accompany me,
but he replied: 'We must see each
other alone, and at night. I will come
at eight this evening.' 'At eight in
the ruins?' I cried. 'Let him expect
me; it must be so; tell him that <i>speech
is silver, but silence is gold</i>.' "</p>

<p>"Let him come!" muttered Pastourel,
casting an involuntary glance upon his
dog, and then at a long oriental poignard
which hung near the head of his bed,
"let him come! But the rest?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. This morning the
Comte D'Auterive sent one of his lackeys
to tell my husband that he wished to see
him at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Marquis of Veroni's," said
Pastourel, quickly, as if he feared that
another name might be applied to the
person of whom Catharine spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she answered, glancing
at Bernard, "at the Marquis of Veroni's.
Pierre, who was formerly a soldier in M.
D'Auterive's company, went thither

<!-- page 106 col 2 -->

without delay, and when he returned, he
told me that the comte had directed him
to come and inform you that he would
visit you about eight o'clock this evening."</p>

<p>"It is well!" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"But what is most singular, just as
he was leaving the castle of&mdash;of the
Marquis of Veroni's, the Comtesse D'Auterive
stopped him in the hall, and commanded
him to announce to you that she
would come here at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>Pastourel glanced with an air of triumph
at the Marquis de Velay, and the
latter was scarcely able to conceal the
emotion of surprise mingled with fear
which stirred in his bosom.</p>

<p>"Let them come! let them come!"
said Pastourel. "Marquis, you may
tell her who sent you, that she can visit
me in the day time."</p>

<p>"I will tell her so," replied Bernard,
subdued by this strange concurrence of
circumstances. Then, as if ashamed of
his submission, he added, in a threatening
tone:</p>

<p>"But if you were Satan in person,
if aught opposes my happiness, forget
not that I shall look for an account from
you alone."</p>

<p>"Hence! madman!" said Pastourel.
"There is no obstacle to your happiness
but yourself. Hence! for a second menace
would cost thee too dear, and I
would long since have abandoned thee
to the savage brutality of thy character,
and to the misfortunes which it will draw
upon thy head, if I had not promised to
protect thee."</p>

<p>Bernard hesitated to obey; but as he
yielded in his own despite to the love
which he felt for Charlotte, so he bent
before the superstitious fear with which
Pastourel had inspired him; he left the
hall, muttering:</p>

<p>"<i>Par l'enfer:</i> I will know how matters
stand."</p>

<p>He at once quitted the ruins, mounted
his horse, and rode at a gallop towards
the castle of La Roque.</p>

<p>We will not follow him towards this
mansion; we will remain with Catharine
and Pastourel.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they alone, when the
tone of the conversation at once changed,
and Catharine assumed a more friendly

<!-- page 107 col 1 -->

air, as she replied to the questions which
the old man addressed to her:</p>

<p>"And the <i>fillou?</i>"</p>

<p>"Do not speak of him," answered
Catharine, "he is mad; he is positively
resolved to espouse Mademoiselle de la
Roque."</p>

<p>"Have you told him that which I
charged you to say to him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but he thinks himself a
marquis out and out, and he says that
his birth is such as might entitle him to
marry some one better than the daughter
of a baron, if it so pleased him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered Pastourel, "I have
been too hasty. I should have known
that vanity is the main spring of his character."</p>

<p>"And a dreadful vanity," said Catharine.
"It is true he was handsome some
fifteen years ago, and if I had not
thought he was my brother, I might
have found him to my liking, but he is
forty years well told, if he were as old
as you said when you brought him to my
father's; he is forty years old then, and
that is not the age when one should
think of a young girl of twenty."</p>

<p>"Catharine," resumed Pastourel,
"that is not the danger, if Charlotte loved
him, and were willing to be his wife,
the obstinate fellow might take the fate
it please God to send him."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said Catharine, "I know
well enough what fate it would please
his wife to send him, after a year of wedlock.
You have made a marquis of him
by some means or other, and he has more
money than many a real marquis, but as
to marking him a marquis out and out,
no, no, father Pastourel; he does not understand
it, he is plain Galidou."</p>

<p>"And if he will not listen to reason,
he shall again become so."</p>

<p>"That is what you told me to say to
him, and I did so, but&mdash;<i>basta!</i> 'Catharine,'
he replied, 'I will keep my rank.
I said once upon a time, that I would bum
and destroy the castle of La Roque, and
I did so; I tell you now that I will marry
the daughter of this old baron, and I
will do so. I will not be led by the
nose&mdash;tell that to the old patriarch that
kept your father's sheep; he knows better
than any one else that I will do as I
please.' "</p>

<!-- page 107 col 2 -->

<p>"Well then," said Pastourel, with
mingled anger and grief, "tell him to
come hither, for if he insists upon it, it
is necessary that he should succeed
without danger to himself and to us all."</p>

<p>"How?" said Catharine indignantly,
"will you aid in disappointing this pretty
Marquis de Velay?"</p>

<p>"By the tone in which you spoke to
him," said Pastourel, "I thought that
you were not to be counted among his
friends."</p>

<p>"Pah! pah! old father," said Catharine,
simpering and laughing primly,
"we detest a man who says soft things;
to us, when he is a mere boy, and then
neglects us when he is a man, but reason
comes with age, and I no longer remember
what passed eight years ago."</p>

<p>"Eight years ago?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you had not then returned
to the province, and he came to visit his
father's estates with his tutor. Poor
boy! he was very pretty in those days."
Pastourel gazed at Catharine with a
strange air, and said:</p>

<p>"And you were pretty then?"</p>

<p>"Why, then he was eighteen, and I
was twenty-seven, and I still went by the
name of beautiful Catharine."</p>

<p>"And he fell in love with you?" said
Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Does that surprise you, father?"</p>

<p>"No, no, but you, did you love him?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pecaire!</i> he was so smooth, so forward,
that I had the greatest difficulty
in defending myself against the passion."</p>

<p>"And did you defend yourself from
it long?"</p>

<p>"Always," said Catharine, rising,
with an air of dignity.</p>

<p>Pastourel did not reply, but he passed
his hand across his forehead, muttering
sadly:</p>

<p>"It is destiny!"</p>

<p>Then he added aloud:</p>

<p>"You are for him, then, against Galidou?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Galidou is a false marquis; he
plays the lordling, and forgets that he
was too happy to eat of our bread. It
is not he that will espouse Mademoiselle
de la Roque."</p>

<p>"I hope not; but he will not come
here unless he thinks that I will consent.
I expect you to persuade him."</p>

<!-- page 108 col 1 -->

<p>"I promise to do so. And he shall
not espouse her."</p>

<p>"That interests you closely?"</p>

<p>Catharine turned pale, and replied in
a strange tone of menace:</p>

<p>"If you love him, let him not marry
Charlotte, do you hear? or some misfortune
will happen to him, and to you
also."</p>

<p>"Do you forget," replied Pastourel,
"that I can punish you for such a
threat?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Catharine, "this tone
and air will do very well for others!
you are no more of a sorcerer or magician
than my shoe; or you would not
have believed the nonsense I just told you
about the young marquis. Well, mind
me, Galidou, or Marquis Veroni, as you
have baptised him at the font of Beelzebub,
will never marry Mademoiselle de
la Roque, I predict it, I! I will go and
send him to you; take good heed to
it."</p>

<p>With these words, Catharine departed
with an indignant air, and Pastourel,
gazing at her as she went, said:</p>

<p>"This creature will annoy me more
than all the others."</p>

<p>We beg the reader to remark these
words, "all the others."</p>

<p>There were others then? Who were
they? If the reader is willing to proceed
with this narrative, he will recognise
them perhaps as he has already recognised
Galidou, under the name of
the Marquis of Veroni.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">SCHEMES OF VENGEANCE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left Pastourel alone, Catharine
returning to her home, and Bernard de
Velay spurring toward the castle of La
Roque. We will enter it before him,
and witness the following scene, which
passed in a retired apartment on the
ground floor. We shall find there two
of our old acquaintances, the Baron de
la Roque and Jean Couteau. But they
were no longer the same men whom we
have previously described to our readers;
the former was no longer the stern

<!-- page 108 col 2 -->

noble, of lofty stature, savage glance,
always ready to mount steed, to draw
sword, cursing, swearing, using violence
to gratify his slightest caprices, and
pushing drunkenness to the wildest excess;
he was now a decrepit old man,
bent double upon his chair, which he
left only for the table or the bed&mdash;crippled
by the gout, acrimonious, but impotent,
and furious at a his impotence,
pondering upon a thought which seemed
to have taken complete possession of his
soul, although not a word escaped his
lips, except, at times, stifled acclamations,
all of which seemed to refer to
some project of vengeance. But for
what, and against whom did he meditate
this vengeance? This no one could
divine, not even Charlotte, whom, from
time to time, he seemed to designate as
its object.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau likewise was no longer
the vigorous, joyous huntsman, who had
acquired a name for intrepidity which
secured him the respect of all the shepherds
in the mountains. Less feeble in
body than the baron, he had reached a
state of almost complete moral decrepitude;
his memory was nearly gone,
but as is often the case with old men,
he would forget what had occurred on
the preceding day, while the remembrance
of that which had long passed,
was clear and distinct. Like his old
master, Jean Couteau was occupied by
a single, predominating thought&mdash;the
thought of his salvation. He passed
three-fourths of the day in prayer; his
rosary never left his hands, and he exercised
his ingenuity in devising modes
of penance, and imposing vows upon
himself which he fulfilled with the most
scrupulous exactitude. His former relations
with Pastourel had become a ceaseless
torment to him.</p>

<p>The resurrection of this man, whom
he had seen stretched upon the earth,
with his head wounded and bleeding;
his appearance in the Wolf's Niche; his
presence in Toulouse, in the midst of
those men who were assembled in the
house of Vergnes; the respect which
had been shown him by some, the obedience
which he had obtained from all, were,
in Jean's eyes, so many proofs that he
was a supernatural being, a sorcerer

<!-- page 109 col 1 -->

given over to Satan, and consequently,
an agent of eternal perdition for him
who had served him.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of these two
men at the moment when we bring
them again before the reader. They
were seated face to face, and the old
seigneur, with drooping head and anxious
mien, regretted more than ever that he
could not read in the face of the hunter
the effect of the words which he was
about to address to him. Suddenly he
raised his head with an air of resolution,
and turning to Couteau, he said, in a
calm, but gloomy voice:</p>

<p>"Jean, we should think of death!"</p>

<p>Old Couteau started and replied with
some agitation:</p>

<p>"Alas, yes, my lord, and happy is he
who is not disturbed by the thought
that he has not sometimes failed in his
duty."</p>

<p>"You are right, Jean, you are right;
and I am not angry with you for saying
so; but it cannot be of yourself that you
speak thus; you have always been prudent
and a friend of justice, while
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord," said Jean, with a
heavy sigh, "each one will have an account
of his own to settle with heaven
without thinking of that of others. I
did not dream of blaming any one; I
repent and do penance."</p>

<p>At any other time the baron would,
doubtless, have manifested some curiosity
to know the sins which weighed so heavily
upon the conscience of Jean Couteau;
but he had an object in view which he
wished to reach at once, and he said:</p>

<p>"It is well, my poor Couteau, but you
have not reflected that among the means
to obtain God's pardon, penance is not
always the most efficient."</p>

<p>These words uttered in a humble
and sanctimonious tone, seemed to
make an impression on the old hunter,
for he replied hastily:</p>

<p>"I know it, my lord, and if I were
rich enough to make some considerable
gift to the church, I would not fail to do
so."</p>

<p>The baron could not repress a smile
of scorn as he replied:</p>

<p>"Certainly in that way you would
obtain the absolution of a priest, but

<!-- page 109 col 2 -->

heaven is not at the orders of these
men."</p>

<p>"You blaspheme, my lord," cried
Couteau, making the sign of the cross,
and mumbling a Pater Noster.</p>

<p>The baron did not interrupt him, and
a moment afterwards resumed:</p>

<p>"Jean, you must pardon me, for when
a man's heart is tortured by remorse,
he doubts of everything; and still what
I said was just. Ah, yes, believe me,
there is one way to ensure God's mercy;
it is to repair as far as lies in our
power the harm which we have done."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Couteau, "I do not think
that I have harmed anyone in all my life;
at least knowingly."</p>

<p>This was a singular answer for a man
in such embarrassment respecting his
salvation, and still it was the truth.
The timorous conscience of the old
hunter depicted to him as an unpardonable
sin, that which could at most be
considered as an act of imprudence,
while beneath this semblance of repentance,
the inexorable soul of the baron
sought only to satisfy a last desire of
vengeance;</p>

<p>"I cannot say that," replied the latter;
"I have done too much harm in this
world to appear without dread in the
presence of divine justice, and it is
this harm that I would repair."</p>

<p>"Blessed be the hour, when this
thought entered your mind!" replied
Jean.</p>

<p>"And you can aid me, my good Jean,
in my devout and pious resolution."</p>

<p>"I do not see how."</p>

<p>"And it will be placed to your account,
believe me," continued the baron,
"you will be absolved from all sin when
you have aided in this good work, while,
if you refuse, you will burden your soul
with an additional crime, and your eternal
perdition will be sealed."</p>

<p>By an inexplicable and instinctive
fear, Jean felt himself by no means
tempted to join in the good works of the
Baron de la Roque, and he replied:</p>

<p>"I am too great a sinner to aid you to
repair your faults, my lord. Besides
you are rich, and you can easily do it
without my assistance."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Jean," said the
baron. "I can do nothing without your

<!-- page 110 col 1 -->

assistance, for you alone can tell me
where I can find those whom I have injured,
and whose pardon I would fain
obtain."</p>

<p>"Alas, my lord," said Jean Couteau,
growing more and more unwilling to become
an instrument in the baron's work
of reparation, "how can a poor man like
me know what has become of all those
with whom you have had dealings?"</p>

<p>"All those with whom I have had
dealings?" rejoined the baron. "All
have not had reason to complain of me,
I think."</p>

<p>"No, my lord, no, certainly," said
Jean with humility, "but at any rate, it
is asking more of me than I can answer."</p>

<p>"I shall ask you only that which you
can answer," replied the baron. "For
instance, there is one man whom I have
wronged out of his fortune, and whom I
forced to leave the country. I wish to
repair the injuries I have inflicted on
him."</p>

<p>"If he has left the country," said
Couteau, desirous of evading the baron's
question, "if he has left the country,
how can I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I suspect that he has returned."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my lord, send for him."</p>

<p>"But he conceals himself under a
false name," replied the baron, "he imagines,
doubtless, that I would persecute
him as in times past."</p>

<p>"Question him."</p>

<p>"But he would not answer me; he
would not believe me were I to assure
him of my kind intentions towards him,
and he would still conceal his real
name."</p>

<p>"What, then, can I do?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my good Jean, if God had not
taken away my sight, I should need no
assistance to recognise him, but although
from the sound of his voice, I think that
he is a man whom we have both known for
many years, yet I cannot say that it is
so. But if to this testimony of my hearing,
you would join that of your sight,
if you could say to me: "that is indeed
the man whom you seek," I would no
longer hesitate to restore to him by my
testament, that of which I have robbed
him, for, as I have said, my thoughts are
of death."</p>

<!-- page 110 col 2 -->

<p>"Is it no more than that, my lord? I
will tell you indeed, if you will show
me this man."</p>

<p>"It cannot be but that you must have
met him during the six months that he
has been in this province."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Jean Couteau suddenly,
"are you one of those who believe,
as my daughter Catharine wished
one day to persuade me, that the Marquis
of Veroni, who lives in such splendor,
is no other than the witch Galidou?"</p>

<p>"Galidou!" cried the baron, while
his features suddenly lost the air of sanctimony
which they had assumed, "Galidou!
that vile shepherd whom you saved
from the teeth of my dogs? that boor
who insulted me, and who, but for his
flight, would have been hung for burning
my castle? has he returned to place
himself within reach of my clutches?
Oh, <i>par le diable!</i> it shall cost him dear!"</p>

<p>"But you said, my lord, that you had
repented."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the baron, restraining
his fury, and making the sign
of the cross, as if in reproof of his violence,
"you must see, however, that
there is a great difference between the
repentance that I feel at having injured
a man of my own rank, and that which
would disturb me, at having flayed alive
a knave of that sort."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Couteau.</p>

<p>"But I do not now refer to Galidou,"
resumed the baron; "I am now speaking
of a man who should of right hold a
high rank, and whom I have driven
from his proper station, for he conceals
himself beneath a name which does not
become his birth."</p>

<p>"I do not know to whom you refer."</p>

<p>"And I do not wish to tell you, my
dear Jean, lest your judgment might be
influenced by the name which I should
utter, and thus you might decide less
justly. You know how easy it is to
form our opinions after the thoughts of
others."</p>

<p>"But how can I recognise this man?"
said Couteau.</p>

<p>"Give me your arm, Jean," said the
old baron, "reach me my crutch, and
come with me into the garden. Perhaps
you will be able to relieve me from my
sad uncertainty without going far."</p>

<!-- page 111 col 1 -->

<p>Jean hesitated; but forty years of
submission are not easily effaced from
the heart, and he obeyed the baron's
command. They entered the garden,
and following the directions of the old
man, they proceeded through winding
alleys, until they reached a small pavilion,
enclosed by green trees and bushes.
Some persons within were conversing
earnestly together, and the baron felt
Jean Couteau's arm tremble as they
heard the voice of a man who said:</p>

<p>"Well then, Charlotte, I will myself
conduct you to this place of meeting."</p>

<p>"God in heaven!" cried Jean, "that
voice!"</p>

<p>The man continued:</p>

<p>"But at what hour will you go?"</p>

<p>"Bernard is to bring me word."</p>

<p>"How if he should wish to accompany
you?"</p>

<p>"I will not permit it."</p>

<p>Couteau shuddered, and the baron
pushed him forward, saying in an under
tone:</p>

<p>"Look through the leaves."</p>

<p>"It is he!" muttered Jean Couteau, in
a smothered voice, and speaking to himself,
rather than to the baron.</p>

<p>The latter drew him hurriedly away,
and said in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Is it not he? is it not Don Jos&eacute;?"</p>

<p>Jean, without comprehending the danger
of the words which had escaped him,
already repented having uttered them,
and prompted by an impulse still more
heedless, perhaps, replied:</p>

<p>"I did not say that it was he, my lord;
I do not know, I may be mistaken, I certainly
am mistaken, I would not peril
my salvation by pointing out an innocent
man as a victim to your vengeance."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the baron, grasping Jean
more tightly by the arm to prevent him
from escaping, "I ought to take vengeance
upon him then, if it be Don Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"I do not know, I cannot say, my lord.
How should I know?"</p>

<p>"From the interview which you had
with Pastourel on the day when Don
Jos&eacute; attempted to assassinate him."</p>

<p>This reply recalled all Jean Couteau's
terrors, and he cried in a tone of supplication:</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord! my lord! the words

<!-- page 111 col 2 -->

of this man, if he is a man, are so many
temptations from hell. Do not believe
them! do not believe them! they will
lead to mischief. Is he not a sorcerer
and an impostor?"</p>

<p>Jean's alarm had given the baron time
for reflection, and he replied in the sad
and humble tone, which he had assumed
at the commencement of this interview:</p>

<p>"Ah, my old Jean, am I not as well
persuaded of this as you are, and was it
not these falsehoods which rendered me
so unjust toward Don Jos&eacute;, to whom I
owe and wish to make reparation?"</p>

<p>Jean Couteau's honesty was now assailed
on a different side. To see the
baron make reparation to Don Jos&eacute;, the
lover of the baroness, appeared to him
dishonorable to his old master; he felt a
violent repugnance at aiding in a step so
humiliating, and he replied with the
bluntness which formerly marked his
character:</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, do not be so anxious
to make amends to M. de Frias. If you
have wronged him, you are quits."</p>

<p>But the baron was listening no longer
to Jean Couteau; a new thought had taken
possession of him, and interrupting
his old servant, he cried:</p>

<p>"What was it he said to Charlotte?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember; they spoke of
a meeting."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the baron, "that
suffices; it is enough."</p>

<p>He then added, with singular vehemence:</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute; de Frias, my fine page, at
last you are in my power!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Away, away!" said the baron,
"they shall not always laugh at the
blind old man. Oh, the blood of Paula
has passed into the veins of her daughter.
Good! good! we shall see, we
shall see!"</p>

<p>"My lord, you terrify me," cried Jean,
shrinking backward. "You have made
me serve you in some horrid purpose of
vengeance."</p>

<p>"Well then!" said the baron, "you
shall do penance for it by ascending the
height of Saint Benoit, upon your knees,
and if when you reach the chapel, you
look through the grate, and see sister
Claude upon her knees in prayer, and

<!-- page 112 col 1 -->

smiting her breast, you can tell her in
my name, that she will soon hear from
me."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Jean, "the baroness
is a holy woman, and if she has sinned,
which I do not know, she has well redeemed
her faults, during the fifteen
years that she has passed in yonder convent."</p>

<p>"She is so holy," said the baron,
"that I would fain help to canonize her,
and you ought to be well pleased, Jean
Couteau, to assist in making her a saint,
and when she is in heaven, she will aid
you in entering, if you are not there before
her, or she will draw you from the
hell which you have merited."</p>

<p>All that ferocity which had formerly
characterised the baron's features, reappeared
as he uttered these words.</p>

<p>"For the love of heaven, my lord,"
cried Jean, "for the love of heaven! undertake
nothing, which may prejudice
my soul's salvation, I beg you, I implore
you! It would be wrong, it would be
base."</p>

<p>"Holla! holla!" cried the baron, in a
voice of thunder, "is there no one here
to rid me of this sniveller, this importunate
knave?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Jean Couteau, as
he withdrew, "I feared that the curse of
heaven would fall upon my head, when
I entered your house again."</p>

<p>"Hence! hence, old dotard!" muttered
the baron, dragging himself toward
the house, as well as he was able; "I
hold my vengeance in my hands, and it
shall be terrible! yes, yes, terrible!"</p>

<p>The baron's cries had reached the pavilion,
where Charlotte was conversing
with the man whom Jean Couteau had
recognised as Don Jos&eacute; de Frias, and of
whom Bernard had spoken to Pastourel,
under the name of Vasconcellos. Charlotte
hurried out, and beheld her father
proceeding with great difficulty, supported
by his crutch alone; she ran towards
him, and placing her arm beneath his,
she said with an air of lively interest:</p>

<p>"Lean upon me, sir!"</p>

<p>The old man started, as if at the touch
of an enemy, and replied roughly:</p>

<p>"Leave me, leave me, Charlotte; you
have something better to do, than to
think of a blind old man like me; you

<!-- page 112 col 2 -->

are at an age when girls lie to their fathers&mdash;when
they begin to be perfidious
and hypocritical."</p>

<p>"How, sir?" cried Charlotte, "how
have I deserved this reproach?"</p>

<p>The Baron de la Roque regretted the
violence which had thus hurried him
away; he repressed his indignation, and
after a momentary silence, replied:</p>

<p>"Charlotte, my child, when a man
suffers, when he is blind, when he feels
his inability to seek the aid of which he
stands in need, he is oftentimes unjust.
I was wrong to complain, for you are a
good child, and you have taken better
care of me than I deserve."</p>

<p>Charlotte was accustomed to the ill
humor of her father, but never before
had she heard him excuse it. She was
moved, for more than one reason, perhaps,
by the turn which the baron had given
to his violence, and she said;</p>

<p>"If any one is wrong, my father, it is
I, for not being near you when you
called."</p>

<p>The baron assumed an air of gay good
humor, and replied:</p>

<p>"And this fault you will repeat upon
the instant, for if I mistake not, I hear
the gallop of a horse. It is Bernard, is
it not? It is he! I feel your arm tremble
against mine."</p>

<p>"Father!" said Charlotte, in confusion.</p>

<p>"Well, well," cried the baron, "I
will wait until you think fit to tell me
the truth, for the marquis loves you."</p>

<p>Charlotte trembled still more violently.</p>

<p>"And you love him also, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let it pass! no more of it; but he
must not delay to ask me for your hand,
for I am hard pressed in another quarter."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father!" cried Charlotte,
"do not pledge your word before two
days have passed&mdash;this is all the delay
I ask."</p>

<p>"Why does he not speak at once?"
said the old man.</p>

<p>"Because I do not wish it," replied
Charlotte, proudly, "I do not wish that
he should ask for my hand, without the
consent of the duke, his father. You
can refuse him for a son-in-law, but I

<!-- page 113 col 1 -->

am unwilling, if you consent, to be refused
for a daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered the old man, "it is
her mother's pride! So much the better!"</p>

<p>They reached the door of the castle,
at the moment when the Marquis de Velay
leaped from his horse. He saluted
the baron, inquired after his health, and
by a sign, gave Charlotte to understand
that he wished to speak with her. As
if the old man had seen this signal, he
said:</p>

<p>"Go, my children, go! The society
of a sick man is not suited to those of
your years. Still, sir marquis, before
you leave the castle, oblige me by your
presence for a few moments in my chamber.
I have a favor to request of you,
relative to the Marquis of Veroni."</p>

<p>After having led the old baron to the
arm chair, which he had left to walk to
the pavilion, Charlotte rejoined Bernard,
and the following conversation occurred
between them. But, before we narrate
it, it is necessary to make the reader acquainted
with the young girl, whom he
as yet, knows only by name.</p>

<p>As the baron had said, Charlotte possessed
the blood and pride of her mother,
but not her mother's passions. Paula
had erred, and she had severely expiated
her fault, even at the time, when, as
would be thought, she was happy from
it. Agitated by remorse, and by the
fear of dishonor, she had even meditated
a greater crime, and still she had taken
refuge in penitence. But Charlotte's
character was very different from that
of her mother's. She had reached the
age of twenty years, and nothing had
yet disturbed the quietude of her heart.
Educated beneath the eyes of the baron,
she had scarcely passed the years of
childhood, when she formed her opinion
of him; instructed solely by the presence
of this wicked old man, she had
learned to look upon vice with aversion.
Yet the vices of the baron, instead of engendering
in the heart of his daughter,
those virtues which were opposed to
them, gave rise only to their opposite
faults.</p>

<p>Thus the baron was gross and licentious
in his language, while Charlotte
spoke with a reserve, which shrunk from

<!-- page 113 col 2 -->

the most innocent jest; the baron gave
way to anger, and raved and swore;
Charlotte was calm even to insensibility,
but the baron soon forgot his anger,
while Charlotte stored up her resentment.
M. de la Roque loved the pleasures
of the table and drank to excess;
Charlotte pushed sobriety to the verge
of the ridiculous. The father braved
opinion, the daughter would have preferred
any suffering, to the humiliation
of the slightest blame. The baron passed
for a brutal and tyrannical father;
Charlotte enacted the part of a most submissive
and devoted daughter; there was
much affected ostentation in the vices of
the baron, but there was a humility still
more affected in the virtues of his daughter.</p>

<p>Striving thus against the influence of
her father's character, perhaps, also, from
motives of calculation, Charlotte tried to
merit commendation in all those points
in which the baron was deserving of
contempt. But on the other hand, if she
gave alms to the poor whom he repulsed,
she was pitiless toward the vagrant
whom he sometimes received with kindness,
and we are obliged to confess that
there was more honesty and humanity
in this old man, whose whole life had
been a tissue of shameful or vicious
deeds, than in this young girl whose every
action was irreproachable.</p>

<p>When the baron directed some extravagant
expenditure of money, Charlotte
was careful not to countermand it or to
blame it, but she dressed herself more
plainly or sold some ornament of value.
This became known, and her conduct
was the subject of general eulogium.
But her virtues were so far from being
virtues, that but for the contrast of her
father's vices, she would not have
known how to appear virtuous. Pride
was the main feature, the very basis of
her character. Yet nature had thrown
an admirable veil over her lofty and
implacable spirit; the expression of
her face was sweet, her eyes were sad
serious, her form was slender, her
step careless, her voice languid and
plaintive. These outward attractions
would have deceived the shrewdest observers,
and the Marquis de Velay
could not be numbered among these.</p>

<p>"Your father is growing kind," said

<!-- page 114 col 1 -->

Bernard, "your angelic patience has
subdued him."</p>

<p>"My father," replied Charlotte, "is,
from his rank, acquainted with those
rules of good breeding which are indispensable
in the presence of a man of
your station."</p>

<p>"It is for this reason that I would
always be near you, to lessen your
trials, and to alleviate the cares of
your position."</p>

<p>This was very prettily said, but
Charlotte had something else to think
of.</p>

<p>"You are too often here, as it is,
Bernard," she replied. "I yield perhaps
too readily to the consolation of
having near me a heart that is not destitute
of pity."</p>

<p>"Destitute of pity!" said Bernard.
"Do you apply this term to the most
ardent affection?"</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay!" said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"The purest!" added Bernard.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," rejoined Charlotte,
"but that your presence here may
give rise to no comments, you must not
prolong it unless you have a valid
title to do so."</p>

<p>"And is not this my highest wish?"</p>

<p>"I am pleased to think so. Marquis de
Velay, but you are not ignorant that
your will is subject to that of the duke,
your father."</p>

<p>"D'Auterive has just arrived with
full powers."</p>

<p>"But you do not know their import."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Bernard, "he must do
as I would have him."</p>

<p>"Bernard," replied Charlotte, "there
is, as you are aware, a man more powerful
than us all, who as I know can
dictate the course of M. D'Auterive."</p>

<p>"Old Pastourel."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"And at what hour can I visit
him?"</p>

<p>Bernard was silent for a moment; he
then cried impatiently:</p>

<p>"Hold, Charlotte! I must own that I
cannot bear to be in the hands of a man
like this. What concern has an astrologer,
whose name and origin are
unknown, with the destiny of the son of
the Duke de Nevers?"</p>

<!-- page 114 col 2 -->

<p>"Bernard," said Charlotte, sadly, "it
is evident that you have always been
happy; you have not been taught to
bow the head to necessities which wound
at once the heart and the pride, but this
lesson must be learned."</p>

<p>"I know not what reasons the Comte
D'Auterive, the Marquis of Veroni, and
others, perhaps, may have to submit
their designs to the will of this Pastourel,
but I have none."</p>

<p>If Bernard had glanced at Charlotte
as he spoke thus, he would have observed
the change in her features, notwithstanding
her efforts to conceal it.
She was silent; she feared lest the agitation
of her voice might betray that of
the heart; but she scanned Bernard
with a piercing glance, as he added:</p>

<p>"Thank God, I have no secret to
conceal!"</p>

<p>"I believe it, Bernard, and it is for
this reason that I have accepted the homage
of your love. But do we know the
secrets of the past? Has not your mother,
like mine, retired to the Benedictines?</p>

<p>"And who knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bernard's face was covered with a
blush.</p>

<p>"I do not pretend to judge of the motives
which have induced my mother to
retire from the world; but whatever
they were, they cannot be honorable to
me, since&mdash;"</p>

<p>A disdainful smile played around
Charlotte's lips as Bernard continued:</p>

<p>"Since they are so to her, I am sure
of it. But in any case they are too far
above what this Pastourel can know to
compel me to have recourse to him."</p>

<p>Charlotte did not reply to this apology
for the duchess; she uttered merely
the words:</p>

<p>"It must be so."</p>

<p>Bernard made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>Charlotte resumed her most majestic
air, and said:</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do, that it
must be so."</p>

<p>"As you please," replied Bernard.
"This man will expect you to-day, at
the hour of five."</p>

<p>"I will go."</p>

<p>"You will not go alone?"</p>

<p>"I will go alone," said Charlotte.</p>

<!-- page 115 col 1 -->

<p>Bernard appeared dissatisfied, and
Charlotte added:</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay, the only apparent
relations which yet exist between us,
are those of ordinary friendship; if this
visit offends other sentiments in your
bosom, I regret it, but it is my duty to
admit no witness to this interview.
This ought to suffice; duty is meritorious
only when it is hard to fulfil.
I will fulfil this as I have fulfilled others,
should my happiness be the forfeit."</p>

<p>This speech, begun in a serious tone,
was ended with emotion, and accompanied
by a tear. Bernard, the repentant Bernard,
who knew with what pious devotion
Charlotte had accomplished the
most trying duties, was ashamed to manifest
the least dissatisfaction, and he at
once replied:</p>

<p>"Go then, Charlotte, go!"</p>

<p>The young girl did not reward her
lover with the slightest show of gratitude
for this compliance, but replied:</p>

<p>"You will not forget that my father
wishes to speak with you,"</p>

<p>"I will go to him, Charlotte, but the
hour of your appointment is still distant,
and you know that I cannot be too much
with you."</p>

<p>"Return to the pavilion, Bernard,"
said Charlotte, "you will find me
there."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">JEALOUSY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> our readers have not forgotten the
suspicions which the Baron de la Roque
had harbored concerning the culpable
intercourse of Don Jos&eacute; and the baroness,
they will understand perhaps, how
the following scene might have occurred
which otherwise would appear odious
beyond all probability.</p>

<p>When young Bernard entered the
baron's presence, the latter appeared
absorbed in profound thought; it seemed
as if he had not heard him approach, for
when the marquis said:</p>

<p>"I am now at your service, my lord
baron," the old man started and replied:</p>

<!-- page 115 col 2 -->

<p>"Ah, is it you, marquis! I did not
expect you so soon; I was recalling my
recollections, and they are so harrowing
that I have yielded to the pain which
these old wounds inflict, when after long
years they open afresh."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, baron!" replied Bernard,
who already regretted the concession
which he had made to Charlotte, "every
age has its cares, and those of the present
are far more keen than those of the
past."</p>

<p>"Do you complain, young man? and
of what? Of some amorous chagrins?
of your inability to gratify some caprice?
Wait until age and infirmity
come upon you, and you will then know
the meaning of misfortune. You are
young, wealthy, handsome, brave. If
a woman slights you, you can give
her a rival in one more rich and beautiful;
if a man insults you, you can
call him to an account, sword in hand;
if you are ambitious, the future lies before
you."</p>

<p>Were this anger and this sadness real,
or was it all a well enacted farce? But
the expression of the baron's features
was so melancholy that Bernard gazed
upon him with more attention as he continued:</p>

<p>"Wait, wait before you complain, until
you see the vengeance for which you
have tarried twenty years, escape you,
because you have no longer the strength
to accomplish it. Wait until a new outrage
threatens your old age, and you feel
yourself nailed to the chair, on which
you sit, without the power to avert it!"</p>

<p>For a moment Bernard imagined that
the baron's anger was directed against
himself, when he spoke of a new outrage
which threatened him. Had not the
young marquis ventured to speak to
Charlotte of flight? had he not whispered
the project to several persons? He was
greatly embarrassed therefore; he endeavored
to reply in a firm tone, but his
emotion did not escape M. de la Roque,
as he said in a stammering voice:</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend you, baron.
Of what outrage do you speak?"</p>

<p>The baron was unable to repress a
movement of undissembled anger, for,
notwithstanding his blindness, he divined
the cause of Bernard's agitation. He

<!-- page 116 col 1 -->

checked himself however, and continued
in a sententious tone:</p>

<p>"Marquis, marquis, all respect for the
noblest names of the kingdom is fast
vanishing, and we cannot wonder that
the boor and the menial mock at our
claims, when our own children show
themselves capable of this neglect."</p>

<p>"No one," said Bernard, still anxious
about himself, "no one, my lord baron,
has failed in respect toward you."</p>

<p>"Alas, my poor boy," rejoined the
baron in a paternal tone, "we men are
blind to mischief, when it is a woman's
mind that plans it."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" said Bernard,
who began to understand that the baron's
accusations were not aimed at him.</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay, I may die with
despair in my heart at seeing my dearest
hopes deceived, but I will not bear with
me to the tomb, the remorse which I
should feel for having assisted in deceiving
a noble family."</p>

<p>Bernard's agitation was visible in the
accent with which he replied:</p>

<p>"What is it? what has happened?"</p>

<P>"I may be deceived, Bernard, but if it
were true that Charlotte could so far
have forgotten the blood which flows in
her veins, as to be enamored of an adventurer&mdash;"</P>

<p>"Just heaven!" exclaimed the marquis.</p>

<p>"If, freed by my infirmities, from that
watchfulness, which is the chief safeguard
of a maiden's honor, she should
have forgotten the respect which she
owes to her name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baron de la Roque," said Bernard,
"it is impossible! I would swear it!"</p>

<p>Although blind, the baron knew from
the change in Bernard's voice, that his
defence of Charlotte was but the involuntary
cry of a man, whose mistress is
accused, while doubt, suspicion and indignation,
are making a tempest of his
soul.</p>

<p>He continued therefore, with that
smooth subtlety whose arrows penetrate
more deeply than the heaviest blows:</p>

<p>"Oh, it is well then, Bernard; I thank
you, I believe you, for you cannot be
deceived so easily as I might be, and
you can testify that it is from a motive
for which she need not blush, that she

<!-- page 116 col 2 -->

receives the Portuguese, Vasconcellos
every day while I sleep."</p>

<p>"Every day while you sleep?" cried
Bernard.</p>

<p>"Since you know it," said the baron,
"I need not be disquieted."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know your views, Bernard. They
honor me, and if aught disturbs the satisfaction
which I feel, it is the fear lest
you might one day reproach me, for
having abused the confidence of your
youth, but I am now tranquil."</p>

<p>For some moments Bernard had not
listened to the baron; he was absorbed
by the jealousy which the old man's
words had excited in his soul. The
baron had ceased speaking, and Bernard
was still occupied with his thoughts. M.
de la Roque impatiently endured this
silence, the movements of which he
could not watch, and he suddenly interrupted
it, by saying, in a tone of bitterness,
which contrasted strangely with
the air of content which he had affected
a moment before:</p>

<p>"Has your happiness put you to sleep,
sir marquis?"</p>

<p>Bernard started up with a bound, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Baron de la Roque, Charlotte is deceiving
me, Charlotte is deceiving you
also! I am sure of it! I would swear it!"</p>

<p>The baron rose suddenly, as if these
words had filled him with dismay.</p>

<p>"Marquis," he cried, "you are too
honorable a man to say a thing like that,
without believing it, without having
proofs of it."</p>

<p>"Baron," replied Bernard, "as you
said a moment since, men are blind to
mischief when it is woman's mind that
plans it; I am convinced of Charlotte's
falsehood, but if you ask me for proofs
I have none, none that are certain."</p>

<p>"It is proofs that I need, in order to
avenge myself, in order to inflict chastisement,"
rejoined the baron. "And
these proofs I demand of you, marquis.
She receives this Vasconcellos every
day, I am sure of it, but they escape
from me when I think to surprise them;
they laugh at the poor blind old man;
they insult him, and I have no one, no
one to avenge me!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bernard, "I will

<!-- page 117 col 1 -->

avenge you, and I will avenge myself!"</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay," relied the baron,
"I demand but one thing of you.
Whatever may be your determination
concerning this Vasconcellos, swear to
me upon your honor that you will not
take a step against him without my permission."</p>

<p>Indignant as he was, Bernard revolted
against this proposition, but the baron
added with a tone of authority which imposed
respect upon the young man:</p>

<p>"Believe me, marquis, I will not arrest
your arm when it is time to strike,
but my rights must precede yours, and
I will denounce you as a man without
honesty or honor, if, like them, you take
advantage of my infirmities, to anticipate
my justice."</p>

<p>The marquis promised to submit to
the guidance of the baron, and
the latter had no difficulty in inducing
him to play the spy upon Charlotte's
steps. An opportunity was near at hand;
the mysterious visit which she was resolved
to make to the sorcerer in the ruins,
must conceal, probably, some mischievous
project, perhaps the arrangement
for her flight with this Vasconcellos.
Bernard awaited the hour with
eager impatience, resolved to obey the
baron, and to recount to him faithfully,
all that he might discover. But the
hasty disposition of the young marquis
did not permit events to follow the course
which the baron had expected.</p>

<p>Before we relate the concluding incidents
of this so complicated, and still, so
simple narrative, it is necessary to inform
the reader more particularly concerning
the principal personage of this story, and
with this design, we will lay before him
the sketch of an old manuscript, in which
the history of this mysterious man is
recounted. We will extract from this
manuscript only such portions as have
particular reference to this narration.&mdash;The
life of the man to whom it relates,
would furnish matter for volumes.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE YOUTH OF PASTOUREL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Giacomo Leone Spaffa</span>, prince of
Puzzano, marquis of Veroni, was born
in Sicily, in 1655. The family of Puzzano
held a lofty rank, and lived in great
splendor, although the estates from
which they drew their revenues were
by no means considerable. It was a
matter of curiosity, therefore, to discover
whence these immense resources could
spring, which sufficed to gratify the most
costly caprices, and their origin was at
last discovered, or suspected rather.
The Prince of Puzzano, to wit, proprietor
of the palace of Pallianti, which was
situated on the sea shore, and owner of
a small bay perfectly secure, and reaching
to the interior of his gardens, was accused
of opening this asylum to smugglers
of every description, and, what was
still worse, to pirates from the coast of
Barbary, who took refuge here from
storms, and from the pursuit of Christian
vessels.</p>

<p>The charge was a serious one, and
might have ruined the family of Puzzano
when the prince, who was then forty-five
years of age, espoused the Comtesse
Fiamma de Landeoli; of whom many
things were said which we are unwilling
to recount, but who passed for a woman
to whom the viceroy refused nothing.
However this may have been, it was
from this marriage, and sooner than
would have been requisite in any other,
that Giacomo, our hero, was born. His
youth was passed as might have been expected
in a position like his, and Giacomo,
freed from all strict supervision, was
still almost a child, when he had all the
passions of a young man. At seventeen
years of age, he eloped with the daughter
of a certain Bruzzone, intendant of the
revenues of the Dominacale at Palermo,
and carried her on board a corsair,
where he remained with her nearly two
years.</p>

<p>This injury to a man of obscure birth
indeed, but who was connected with the
affairs of the church, was more fatal to
the family of Puzzano, than all the culpable
actions of which they had before
been guilty. The minds of the people

<!-- page 118 col 1 -->

were aroused by the long impunity
which they had enjoyed; the priests denounced
from the pulpit the infamous
protection granted by the prince to the
infidel pirates, and if he had not left
Sicily, he would have been exposed to
the resentment of an exasperated populace.
It was during this adventure of
Giacomo's, therefore, that the prince of
Puzzano retired to Naples, with a considerable
fortune, but deprived of the resources
which he found in the secret protection
that he accorded to the pirates of
the sea.</p>

<p>Now, while the father expiated the
follies of the son, the latter, safe on board
his vessel, had attacked a ship from Pisa,
in which was found a considerable quantity
of merchandise. Ignorant of that
which had occurred during his absence,
Giacomo brought his prize to the castle
Pallianti, and was greatly surprised at
finding it abandoned by his family, and
confided to the care of a steward and a
few domestics merely. Notwithstanding
this, he secured his prize in the harbor,
and confined his prisoners in the castle.
It was on this occasion, that the first adventure
occurred to our hero, which is
connected, in some respects, with the present
narrative.</p>

<p>Among the men whom he had taken
prisoners on board the Pisan ship, were
two individuals, very different in character
and appearance. One of them, named
Festavanti, did not appear in the slightest
degree afflicted at the sad destiny
which awaited him, for, like all his companions
in misfortune, he was to be re-embarked
on board the corsair, carried
to some island in the Greek Archipelago,
and sold as a slave. This Festavanti was
a sculptor of Verona, and was reputed to
be a skilful craftsman in the art of imitating
the human face by composition of
melted wax, colored like life. It was a
means of ensuring his fortune, he said,
in any country. This art, which is now
employed to adorn the hair-dresser's
shop merely, was then considered as
nearly allied to magic, and it was seldom
that these images were used, unless in
sorceries or conjurations. His reputation
had spread so widely, that it aroused
the suspicions of the inquisition, and
when Festavanti was taken by Giacomo

<!-- page 118 col 2 -->

Puzzano, he was flying from a summons
of this dreadful tribunal.</p>

<p>The other person whom Giacomo had
taken prisoner, was a Milanese Jew, who
had just realized a brilliant speculation
at Pisa, and had taken passage on board
this ship, with a view to settle some affairs
at Montpellier. This man, unlike
Festavanti, wept incessantly, and cursed
the fatal chance which had thrown him
into the power of Giacomo.</p>

<p>Our young adventurer was singularly
interested in Festavanti, who, when on
ship board, had shown him various specimens
of his art. Thus, he had fabricated
for Giacomo, a mask, which so exactly
represented the features of one of
the sailors, that in the evening twilight,
he had mingled with the crew, and had
been taken for the man whose visage he
had borrowed.</p>

<p>This talent of Festavanti's was very
welcome to Giacomo, and he promised
to make his fortune, if he would enter
his service, an offer which the artist
eagerly accepted. In the mean while
the day had arrived on which the prisoners
were to be embarked, and sent to be
sold as slaves. According to the bargain
made with the captain of the corsair,
every man retained by Giacomo,
was to be paid for as if he had been sold
at a slave market. They had agreed
upon a price of three hundred crowns
for Festavanti, when the Jew, who was
named Ben-Aissar, requested a private interview
with the Moorish captain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rapidity with
which we are obliged to hurry over this
recital, we will repeat the conversation
which passed between the Jew and Giacomo,
in order to show the origin, of that
strange association which we have met
with in the course of this narration.</p>

<p>Giacomo, when informed of the wish
of Ben-Aissar, received him in the presence
of Festavanti; he had covered
his face with a mask that represented the
features of the Moorish captain who commanded
his vessel, wishing to avail himself
of this opportunity to put the talent
of the artist to the test.</p>

<p>The Jew for a moment appeared embarrassed,
but Giacomo's first words
restored his courage.</p>

<p>"You have requested an interview

<!-- page 119 col 1 -->

with me, and I have granted it," he said
to Ben-Aissar, "but if your object is to
implore mercy, you need not waste your
time in idle supplications, or in tears, or
in useless assurances. If you should
promise me, nay, if you should give me
fifty-fold your value, I would not grant
your prayer. You shall never return to
Italy to inform against me; you are destined
to live and die in slavery."</p>

<p>"What has the Moorish corsair to
dread from the accusation of a poor
Jew?" said Ben-Aissar. "Giacomo
Spaffa alone might harbor such a fear,
and I know that he keeps near him that
man, who, as well as I, can give information
to the viceroy."</p>

<p>"You are deceived, Jew; this worthy
Festavanti enjoys one advantage over
you; he has had some dealings with the
Holy Inquisition, and he is too familiar
with the customs of the mild guardian of
the faith, to trust himself within the reach
of its clutches. Besides, I do not see
how your freedom can profit my associate,
and I promise you he will not expend
a single piece of gold for the sake
of keeping you with him."</p>

<p>"May God soften your heart!" said
the Jew, "you have robbed me of my
treasures, and I abandon them without
regret; but it is not merely because
Festavanti stands ill with the Inquisition
that the brave Giacomo keeps him near
him; it is because of his cunning talent in
moulding wax faces, which still deceive
no one."</p>

<p>"You think so?" cried Festavanti,
glancing at Giacomo with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"I do not say," replied the Jew, "that
at first sight this mask which hides the
face of signor Giacomo might not deceive
a man who had no interest in discovering
the deception; but if your
handiwork," continued the Jew, while
Giacomo removed the mask, "if your
wares were subjected to the test of the
microscope and the thumb, and if the eye
of a Lombard should scan them, feature
by feature, the truth would be soon discovered,
while those which I fabricate
would defy the most cunning usurers of
Italy."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the young prince, "what

<!-- page 119 col 2 -->

mean you, master Jew? What craft do
you understand so well?"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Ben-Aissar, "why, that
which gives to a bit of tin and antimony
the appearance and sound of a silver
crown. This is a disguise more profitable
than those which are made from the wax
of signer Festavanti."</p>

<p>"And probably," said Giacomo, "the
treasures that you abandon to us with
such generosity, are made of no better
materials?"</p>

<p>"They are of all kinds, my lord, but
this is a work which requires solitude
and secrecy, and if I were owner of a
castle like this, in a few years, I would
become monarch of all the Indies."</p>

<p>These words furnished Giacomo with
ample matter for reflection, and he said
to Ben-Aissar:</p>

<p>"How did you discover this secret?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>," said the Jew, "I have spent
thirty years of my life in prosecuting
the great work; I have lost over my
furnaces more gold and more years than
I have yet to hope for, and my experience
in alchemy has taught me this
truth&mdash;that to have gold, it is necessary
not to make it."</p>

<p>It was in the course of this interview,
that an association was formed between
these three persons, which, in after years,
included an entire province.</p>

<p>In order to reach his aim, Giacomo
was initiated into the secrets of alchemy
by Ben-Aissar, and into those of his
art by Festavanti. But too young to
employ with discretion the power which
he held in his hands, he made use of it
to gratify his passions. Concealed under
various masks, he had discovered
more than one domestic secret, and had
afterwards enjoyed the gratification of
divulging it. Some indiscretions of this
nature, together with his studies in
alchemy, gained him the reputation of a
man devoted to the occult sciences, and
in direct communication with the devil.
The prince, his father, had died after a
few days' illness, and rumor did not
hesitate to say that Giacomo had hastened
his disease. This was a fearful
calumny, but the most frightful suspicions
hovered over him, and while he
was pondering upon the means of escape,
he was arrested, and thrown into prison.

<!-- page 120 col 1 -->

His trial was prolonged for more than
two years, and what was very remarkable,
although almost all the instruments
which he employed in the fabrication of
counterfeit coin, as well as the masks
which he had worn, had been seized,
yet the minds of the judges were not for
a moment directed towards the truth.</p>

<p>The furnaces and alembics were employed,
as they thought, in the preparation
of philters and magical potions; the
masks were the images of those persons
whom he wished to devote to the powers
of hell; at last, after the most minute
investigation, Giacomo was condemned
to be burned as a sorcerer. His family
was implicated in this sentence; his
mother was exiled from Naples with her
daughter Leonore, then seven or eight
years of age, and nothing could save the
prince of Puzzano, even from the disgrace
of a public execution.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances, that
the inventive genius of Festavanti displayed
its resources. And if the fact
which we are about to relate, were not
attested by numerous witnesses, we
should hesitate to recount it. According
to the sentence rendered by the tribunal
of the Holy Inquisition, the Prince
of Puzzano, was taken from prison, and
led to the quay of the chiaia, where the
funeral pile was prepared. He was
placed upon it, the combustible materials
which surrounded him were kindled, and
he disappeared from the eyes of the multitude
in flames and smoke. Still he
did not perish. The stratagem by which
the friends of Puzzano rescued him from
death, was a very simple one. These
friends were already numerous, they
were already initiated, not into the secret
of the manufacture, the principal seat of,
which was at Pallianti, but into the association,
and Puzzano was their hope
and their chief. They lulled to sleep
the prudence of the judges and of the
civil authority; no petitions were made
to save him, no man&oelig;uvres to retard his
punishment. On the contrary, those
most interested in his safety were prodigal
of their anathemas against the vile
sorcerer, who had sold himself to the
prince of darkness. The pile was prepared
upon the quay of the chiaia, exactly
over the spot where one of the largest

<!-- page 120 col 2 -->

sewers in Naples, flowed beneath this
quay, and emptied itself into the sea.
An open space had been left in the centre
of the pile, which was strewn with
light loose pieces of wood, which the
condemned could easily thrust aside with
his feet.</p>

<p>During the night in which the pile
was erected, his friends had removed
the flagging with which the quay was
paved, excavated the around, and pierced
through the vault of the sewer.
A slight wooden ladder, which would
probably be consumed by the fire above,
led from the platform to the sewer, at
the outlet of which, a boat was in readiness
to bear Puzzano beyond the reach
of his enemies. All this succeeded admirably,
and the familiars of the Holy
Inquisition were still chanting around
the pile, which had been constructed so
as to spread abroad a dense smoke, while
Giacomo was already half a league from
the Bay of Naples, where he was taken
on board a brigantine, which bore him
in safety to the coast of France.</p>

<p>Giacomo was at this time twenty five
years of age, and the lesson which he
had just received, made but a weak impression
upon him, for instead of satisfying
his thirst for adventure, it inspired
him with a taste for strange and romantic
exploits.</p>

<p>This event took place in the year
1680, and it was at this time that Giacomo,
who was rejoined by his companion
Festavanti, fitted out several galleys and
resumed the trade of a corsair. To secure
the protection of some constituted
power, he turned Mahometan, and established
the seat of his operations at Tripoli.
It was here that he began to
establish relations with the various governments
of the Barbary coast, and it
was at this time that he became acquainted
with the Comte de Frias, who
was then governor of the <i>Pr&eacute;sides</i>.
From the indulgence which the latter often
showed to Puzzano, it was evident
that, even at that time, he was one of his
accomplices. Still, Giacomo's attention
was wholly occupied with piratical
cruises, when the following adventure
gave a different direction to his enterprises.</p>

<p>From the description which we have

<!-- page 121 col 1 -->

given of Pastourel in the commencement
of this narrative, we cannot but believe
that in his youth, he must have been endowed
with remarkable beauty. This
beauty was Giacomo's greatest enemy
(for Giacomo and Pastourel are one and
the same person). He encountered few
females, in truth, who were not fascinated
by that determined mien, that bold
glance, that lofty, commanding tone,
which he had acquired by the exercise
of a power almost unlimited, and beside
this, neither anxiety for his own safety,
nor any enterprise, however profitable,
could tear him from the bands which he
had imposed upon himself. We are not
called upon to recount all the strange
adventures which marked the extraordinary
career of this man, but we must
relate one which has a direct reference
to this narrative. We request our
readers to remember that the Princess
of Puzzano, Giacomo's mother, had been
exiled. She had retired to France,
where the city of Toulouse had been
assigned to her as a place of residence,
and she dwelt there with her daughter
Leonore; here Giacomo often visited
her, sometimes under one disguise,
sometimes under another, while even his
sister was kept in ignorance of the name
and character of this stranger, whose
visits were accompanied by the most
magnificent presents. This premised,
we will relate the adventure which
proved, if we may so speak, the point of
departure for all the events which we
have recounted to our readers.</p>

<p>As we have said, the Prince of Puzzano
made frequent visits to his mother,
now in one costume, now in another, but
that which disguised him still more effectually
than this diversity of attire,
was the art with which he changed the
expression, nay, almost the features of
his face, without resorting to the masks
of Festavanti. But whether he wore his
hair of a light or dark hue, whether he
gave to his features a tinge of the most
delicate fairness, or of the brown and
olive complexion of Spain, whether he
bent his frame, and furrowed his brow
with the wrinkles of old age, or whether
he presented the aspect of a young student
of the university, Giacomo always
displayed an air of authority, of command,

<!-- page 121 col 2 -->

of moral force, which marked
him as a man of no ordinary pretentions.</p>

<p>One evening, after an absence of three
years, he was proceeding through a deserted
street, disguised as a muleteer,
when he paused on hearing some one
advance cautiously behind him, for he
was of opinion, that it is better to have
one's friends as well as one's enemies
in front than at one's back. The night
was dark, for, at this time, Toulouse, as
well as every other city in France, was
not lighted by lanterns of any kind.
Every man carried about him his weapons
of defence, and Giacomo was armed
with a long Catalonian cutlass or poignard,
and a large knotted club.</p>

<p>The individual whom he had heard
was probably of the same opinion with
himself as to the respective position
which should be maintained by two individuals
who have cause to fear each
other, for Giacomo had no sooner stopped,
than the steps which he had heard behind
him stopped also.</p>

<p>This circumstance induced our adventurer
to suppose that he had been
observed and perhaps recognised; for
his costume was by no means adapted
to excite the cupidity of ordinary thieves.
He was aware that it had been suspected
for some time past, in Naples,
that he was still in existence, and it was
not unlikely that the information had
been transmitted to the magistrates of
Toulouse.</p>

<p>The parliament of Toulouse, like all the
parliaments of the kingdom, had inherited
the claims of the estates; and although
the absolute sway of Louis XIV.
had greatly reduced these claims, still
some few prerogatives, rather tolerated
than recognised, had escaped the jealous
authority of the king, and among
them must be numbered that of
the general police of the city, which,
according to the interpretation of the
parliament, embraced the right of surrendering
criminals to a foreign state.
The Prince of Puzzano knew this; he
knew that if an agent of the Neapolitan
government should come to demand his
arrest, parliament would grant it, less
indeed from a love of justice, than for
the sake of exercising a power which

<!-- page 122 col 1 -->

was daily gliding from its grasp, and
of confirming it by an act which could
not fail to attract attention. This
was the cause of his alarm, when he
heard the footsteps which followed him
stop at the same time with his own, for,
as we have said, his apparel was not
calculated to inspire robbers with the
hopes of reaping profit from an encounter
with him.</p>

<p>The spot where Giacomo paused was
close by a garden wall, and at a short
distance from him he observed a gate
set deep in the thickness of the stone work.
He stole cautiously into this recess, and
waited the approach of the individual
who had followed him. After a few
moments he heard steps anew, but these
came from an opposite direction of the
street, so that Giacomo imagined that
he was intercepted by two enemies.
His first thought was of flight. He now
resolved to rid himself of one of his assailants,
and he was about to leave the
embrasure in which he stood, when he
heard the bolts which fastened the gate,
drawn carefully by some one on the
inner side. By a mechanical movement
he pushed it, entered the garden,
and found himself standing face to face
with a woman who said to him in the
softest tone:</p>

<p>"You have come very late, monseigneur!"</p>

<p>Giacomo had been exposed to too many
dangers, he had risked his life in too
many hazardous adventures, not to have
acquired that presence of mind which
takes advantage of any circumstance
that presents itself. At her first word
he imagined that he had taken the place of
some gallant of high rank, since he had
been addressed by the title of monseigneur;
he divined that the female who
met her lover in this way, must have
reasons for secrecy, since she employed
such mystery, and he replied boldly:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur cannot come this evening,
and he has sent me to inform you
of it."</p>

<p>A cry of grief and terror was the
answer to these tidings.</p>

<p>"What! cannot come this evening?
Why, it is impossible!&mdash;Or will he forsake
me?"</p>

<p>The mind of Giacomo was so constituted

<!-- page 122 col 2 -->

that at this reply all fears for his
own safety vanished, and the only emotion
which disturbed him, was an eager
curiosity to understand the mystery in
which he found himself implicated.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur is incapable of forsaking
you, but business of great importance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has he told you nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur is not in the habit of
confiding his secrets to those whom he
employs, and although he judged me worthy
to be sent on this errand, yet he has
not told me the reason which prevents
him from coming."</p>

<p>A long silence followed this reply;
suddenly the female cried with a strange
accent of determination:</p>

<p>"Well then, tell your master that
since he cannot come this evening, it is
useless for him ever to return; my lot
is fixed, and I shall know how to accomplish
the sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Do not take this desperate resolution,
fair lady," said Giacomo. "I have some
influence with monseigneur, although I
appear to be far beneath him, and if I
knew what support, what assistance you
expected from him, perhaps I could determine
him to keep his promises."</p>

<p>"I thank you," replied the female,
"but I would not owe to the intercession
of a stranger that which his own gratitude
has not dictated in my behalf."</p>

<p>This word produced a change in Giacomo's
ideas; a forsaken mistress does
not speak of gratitude, and he now became
still more curious to understand
the nature of an intrigue, which was
carried on by nocturnal interviews, and
in which there was no question of love.</p>

<p>"Listen, madam," he replied, "I think,
nay, I am sure, that monseigneur desires
nothing more warmly than to prove to
you his gratitude, but it is necessary to
leave the time and means to him; and
if you will tell me where he can see
you to-morrow morning, and what you
wish him to do in the mean while, I am
certain that he will not fail."</p>

<p>Another silence followed these words,
but at the moment when the unknown
dame was about to reply, the steps that
Giacomo had heard approached the gate
from either extremity of the street, and
paused almost, at the same instant in

<!-- page 123 col 1 -->

front of it. It appeared as if the two
individuals had met, paused to observe
each other before proceeding farther. At
last one of them spoke and said:</p>

<p>"It seems that you have reached the
place where you wish to enter, for you
do not continue on your way."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, M. Barati," replied the other,
"but it seems we are both going to the
same place, since you have stopped as
well as I."</p>

<p>"It is he!" murmured the young female
in a tone of dismay; "what did
you tell me then?"</p>

<p>"He must have despatched his business
sooner than he expected," whispered
Giacomo, while he who was addressed
by the name of Barati, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord duke, I have reached
the spot to which I was going, though
not to enter, but to prevent you from
entering."</p>

<p>The sound of a sword leaving its
scabbard was heard, and the duke replied
quickly:</p>

<p>"Well then, sir advocate, I shall be
obliged to clear the way."</p>

<p>"Duke de Nevers," replied Barati,
"you know me well enough to be assured
that I am not terrified at a
sword."</p>

<p>"True, <i>pardieu!</i> for I have seen you
in full parliament present the sword of
honor, which is bestowed yearly upon
that student of the university who has
borne away the prize at fencing; but
we who wear it have a fashion of wielding
this weapon which will perplex your
skill; I counsel you, therefore, to give
way, or your blood be upon your own
head."</p>

<p>"We will not fight, sir; my blood
will be neither upon your head nor upon
mine, neither will you enter," said Barati,
"for there needs but one word from
me to make you pause. I know your
errand to this house."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>," said the duke, laughing,
"you have found here a reason, truly
diverting in my eyes. You know that
I am, going to the President Lostanges,
to break off your marriage with his
daughter, the beautiful Armande. I do
not wish to conceal it."</p>

<p>"But I know," replied Barati, "by
what means you expect to succeed."</p>

<!-- page 123 col 2 -->

<p>"I care as little to conceal these
means as I do my object. I intend to
tell the president that you, master Barati,
an advocate of parliament, have, from
among the documents of a suit entrusted
to you in my absence, suppressed a
letter from my uncle, the Marquis de
Soubise, to my mother, which established
my rights as his heir, and which annulled
the clauses of a prior will."</p>

<p>"This letter is in existence and in my
keeping, Duke de Nevers," said Barati.
"I can restore it to you, but it will be
necessary, to produce it as it is, if you
would revive this suit, and I declare to
you that this letter contains the following
sentence:</p>

<p>" 'Notwithstanding the acknowledgement
which you have made to me of
your error, and although I know that
your son has no right either to the name
he bears, or to the fortune that he has
inherited, yet I will destroy the testament
which I have made to his prejudice.&mdash;Now,
that a decree of parliament has
legitimated his birth, I am unwilling to
suffer the slightest suspicion to rest upon
the name that he bears, and I will sacrifice
my resentment to the honor of my
family.' "</p>

<p>The duke did not reply, and Giacomo
laughed within himself at the secret
which he had just learned, when Barati
continued:</p>

<p>"Why this testament has not been revoked,
is a question I cannot answer, but
you have heard the grounds on which to
base your title, and I thought that I was
doing my duty as a faithful advocate in
suppressing it."</p>

<p>"And you will do the duty of a friend
in placing this letter in my hands, master
Barati. But where the devil was my
mother's wit, when she wrote me that
she had left among her papers a letter
which secured to me my uncle's heritage?"</p>

<p>"She had forgotten, perhaps, the preamble
that preceded the declaration."</p>

<p>"My mother was not apt to forget
these things, master Barati; my mother
was a woman of sense; but however it
may be, let us go to your house, show
me the writing in question, and I promise
to meddle no more with your amorous
and matrimonial affairs, for, between

<!-- page 124 col 1 -->

ourselves, it was rather to punish your
misdemeanor, than to protect this silly
Armande, that I undertook this foolish
commission. Come! come!"</p>

<p>With this, the two individuals departed,
and Giacomo found himself alone with
Mademoiselle Armande de Lostanges,
with whose name and rank he was now
acquainted, although she had not the
least suspicion of his own.</p>

<p>During this interview, Armande had
kept profound silence, but when they
had retired, she muttered in a smothered
voice:</p>

<p>"The Duke de Nevers is a wretch!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> my fair demoiselle," resumed
Giacomo, in a tone very different
from that which he had hitherto assumed,
"had I been in his place, I should not,
perhaps, have resisted an argument so
direct as that which young Barati addressed
to him, but that which the Duke
de Nevers cannot do, another can do in
his stead, and that other is myself."</p>

<p>"You, sir," replied Mademoiselle de
Lostanges, "you cannot have that influence
over my father which the Duke de
Nevers could exert. It is not merely
by accusing M. Barati of suppressing
this document that he could have
brought about the rupture of a marriage,
resolved upon by my father, and which
my tears and my mother's prayers have
not been able to avert."</p>

<p>"If the means which the Duke de
Nevers possessed would have been effectual,
they would be equally so in the
hands of another. Do you know these
means?"</p>

<p>It was not until this moment that a
slight feeling of alarm disturbed Armande,
and that she was aware of the singularity
of her position in conversing
thus familiarly of an affair so private,
with a man with whom she was entirely
unacquainted, and one who had announced
himself as an emissary of the
Duke de Nevers.</p>

<p>She replied, therefore, with a faltering
voice:</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, for the protection
which you offer me, but I neither can,
nor ought to accept it from a stranger."</p>

<p>"And from a muleteer," said Giacomo,
laughing. "Well then, my fair
demoiselle, I ask you but one thing more.

<!-- page 124 col 2 -->

What day is appointed for the marriage
which you wish to avert?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow gives me but little time
to take my measures if you will not aid
me. If I had but a week, but three
days before me, I could promise you that
this marriage should not take place, for I
am greatly interested in your behalf;
I know not why, but I feel quite ill disposed
toward this M. Barati, and very
anxious to make the Duke de Nevers
repent of his baseness."</p>

<p>The tone in which these words were
uttered, was so like that of a man of superior
rank, that Mademoiselle de Lostanges
suspected that some personage of
importance was concealed beneath this
garb of a muleteer.</p>

<p>"Who are you then, sir?" she said;
"for you are certainly not in the service
of the Duke de Nevers, as you told me."</p>

<p>"Listen, fair demoiselle," replied Giacomo,
"to the story of my night's adventure."</p>

<p>He then related to her, but with the
reserve necessary to his safety, how he
had feared an assault in the night, how
he had concealed himself in the recess
of the garden gate, and had thus involuntarily
discovered her secret.</p>

<p>"All this does not tell me who you
are," replied Mademoiselle de Lostanges,
who now greatly regretted her confidence.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you that," rejoined
Giacomo, "for my name must forever
remain a secret. But it is not the less
true that I have the wish and the ability
to serve you. The thought pleases me,
fascinates me, and perhaps the danger
which I may run, renders this desire
the more ardent. Confide in chance, then,
mademoiselle; it often protects us better
than the best contrived plans. Tell me,
then, this <i>ultima ratio</i>&mdash;I mean to say, this
last means by which the duke could induce
your father to break off this marriage,
and I pledge you my word of honor
that I will use it in your behalf."</p>

<p>Armande hesitated and replied:</p>

<p>"This means, sir, is a secret that I
cannot reveal to the first comer, for it
concerns persons who are already exposed
to too many dangers, and I am unwilling
to increase them. This secret,

<!-- page 125 col 1 -->

sir, would, I am sure of it, have changed
my father's purpose, whose strict integrity
would never pardon M. Barati, for
an act of treason in favor of the enemies
of our king and our religion; but this
secret would remain without danger for
those whom it concerns, when confided
to a father, and not to a magistrate."</p>

<p>"I am no magistrate, mademoiselle,
and I shall no more abuse this secret
than the president your father. But
since you know it, why not yourself reveal
it to M. de Lostanges?"</p>

<p>"He would not believe me, sir; the
resistance which, until this day, I have
opposed to his wishes, would lead him
to look upon this disclosure as a calumny.
And while I think of this, I might
say that this charge would have no more
weight when coming from your lips than
from mine, for there is no one but the
Duke de Nevers who can know&mdash;with
such certainty, at least, as to convince
my father of the truth on this subject&mdash;of
the relations of M. Barati with the
Princess of Puzzano."</p>

<p>The effect which this name produced
upon Giacomo, may be easily comprehended.
Since he had left his mother
he was ignorant of any new connections
which she might have formed, whether
with Barati or with the Duke de Nevers,
and he now found himself thrown into
the midst of an intrigue, which at first
seemed to be in no way connected with
him.</p>

<p>"The Princess of Puzzano," he replied
warmly, "has interests in common
with this Barati, and doubtless with the
Duke de Nevers also! Well then, my
child, whether you tell me more or not,
I promise I will clog the wheels of master
Barati's project; what you have told
me suffices, for I shall go at once to the
Princess of Puzzano's."</p>

<p>"You do not know, then, that she left
Toulouse yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Left Toulouse!" cried Giacomo, in
a tone of dismay, so unaffected, that Armande
felt assured that the man who
spoke this must know the princess, and
was unfeignedly surprised and alarmed
at this departure of which he was ignorant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Armande, "and a
new residence more distant and more

<!-- page 125 col 2 -->

solitary has been assigned to her; the
town of Mirepoix has been allotted to her
as a refuge, under the penalty of exile,
if she leaves it for a single day."</p>

<p>"And this Barati has had a hand in
this persecution?" said Giacomo in a
gloomy tone. "I swear it&mdash;he shall
repent of it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! on the contrary, he was
the princess' friend; he was concerned
in the intrigues which she plotted at
Toulouse, the proofs of which are in the
hands of the Duke de Nevers."</p>

<p>It was now Giacomo's turn to be silent.</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" he said to himself, "if
this Barati is a friend of my friends, I
do not well see why I should set myself
against him."</p>

<p>Still his curiosity increased with every
moment, and he resumed:</p>

<p>"But what intrigues could the princess
of Puzzano, a poor, lone woman, plot
against the faith and against the state,
and intrigues in which this M. Barati is
implicated?"</p>

<p>"It is not for me to tell you."</p>

<p>"But I must know them!" cried Giacomo,
with such violence that Armande
was terrified.</p>

<p>She started backward and uttered a
cry.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, my child," said
Giacomo, in a softer tone; "chance, in
which a moment since, I begged you to
confide, has so ordered it, that I am perhaps
as deeply interested as yourself, in
knowing the secret of these intrigues&mdash;ha!
the Princess of Puzzano has been
exiled! <i>Pardieu!</i> I will know with whom
this new persecution has originated,
and the culprit shall rue it, I promise
you."</p>

<p>"You terrify me, sir," said Armande.
"I would not endanger the safety of any
one, and if you are a friend of the princess,
as your anger seems to prove, forget
not that I have refused to tell you
her secret, in order not to compromise
her."</p>

<p>"You are right, mademoiselle," replied
Giacomo, "but since you understand
so well that I have some cause to be interested
in the princess, you will tell me
this secret, that I may at least protect
her."</p>

<p>Armande hesitated, and after a moment's

<!-- page 126 col 1 -->

silence, replied with great anxiety:</p>

<p>"I cannot, sir! I cannot!"</p>

<p>"As you will, but I shall learn it then
from Barati whom I shall visit on the
instant."</p>

<p>Giacomo turned to leave the garden,
but Armande detained him, and said:</p>

<p>"Master Barati, sir, I am certain of
it, master Barati will accuse persons,
who, I assure you, are perfectly innocent.
Do not go to him."</p>

<p>"In that case, you must yourself tell
me the truth, for, I repeat it, I must
know it."</p>

<p>"Well then, promise me that you will
not avail yourself of it to injure my
father, and I will tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Giacomo, "I begin to
comprehend you. Is your father by
chance one of those who have persecuted
the Princess of Puzzano?"</p>

<p>"My father," replied Armande, "fulfils
his duties strictly, but he is incapable
of persecution."</p>

<p>"It is well," said Giacomo, "we shall
learn to appreciate his forbearance.
And M. Barati, what has he done in all
this?"</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, since it is necessary
to tell you all, he has abused the confidence
of my father, who revealed to him
the measures he was about to take, to
seize, in the house of the princess, the
proofs of the existence of her son, a
wretch who has been guilty of every
crime. Barati warned the princess of
it, and every search was ineffectual."</p>

<p>"But this Barati seems to be a very
gallant man," said Giacomo, laughing,
"and were I in your place, I should be
delighted to espouse him."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, if it were generosity on his
part, I should understand it; but it was
not to save an exiled woman that he did
this, it was to&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a voice was heard
calling Mademoiselle de Lostanges, who
said hurriedly to Giacomo:</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, if you cannot protect me, at
least do not use what I have told you to
the injury of any one."</p>

<p>"I will use it only to keep my promise,"
said Giacomo, "I swear to you, you
shall not espouse Master Barati; I will
see to it. But tell me where he lives."</p>

<!-- page 126 col 2 -->

<p>Armande gave the unknown the advocate's
address, and disappeared down
the garden, while Giacomo left it, and
turned his steps towards the dwelling
of the young advocate.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A quarter</span> of an hour after the interview
described in the preceding chapter,
Giacomo knocked at Barati's door.
The hour was untimely, and it was long
before the door was opened; the domestic
who appeared would have turned
away the importunate visitor; but Giacomo
thrust him aside quickly, entered
the house, and directed the servant in a
voice loud enough to he heard by Barati,
to tell his master that a muleteer of the
mountain who had passed through Mirepoix
desired to see him instantly. In this
way our adventurer wished to assure
himself of the truth of what Armande
had told him; and he could not doubt it,
when he heard the voice of Barati exclaim eagerly:</p>

<p>"Show him up! show him up!"</p>

<p>Giacomo entered Barati's cabinet; the
advocate was at this time about twenty-five
years of age; has face was marked
with care and thought, but his every
feature bore the impress of singular energy,
and his form was carved in proportions,
which denoted an unusual share
of physical strength and activity.</p>

<p>Near him, was seated a man, perhaps
one or two years older than Barati, of
lofty stature, and bearing in his port, and
in his visage, a consciousness of merit at
variance with the general expression of
his features. There was more insolence
indeed than intelligence in his handsome,
but gross and massive countenance, and
Giacomo, suspecting that it was the Duke
de Nevers, called to mind the imputation
which he had just heard cast upon the
legitimacy of his birth, an imputation
which had been the subject of a disgraceful
trial, an imputation with which
our readers may remember that D'Auterive
had reproached the duke when
speaking of his birth.</p>

<!-- page 127 col 1 -->

<p>"You call out rather loudly my
friend," said Barati to the muleteer,
"this is not the way to enter an honest
dwelling."</p>

<p>"Is the dwelling honest, in the first
place?" said Giacomo, "that is the question."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"And if it were so, was I wrong to
call out so loudly, when it was the only
means to obtain admission?"</p>

<p>"The knave has wit," said the duke,
laughing.</p>

<p>Giacomo, who, but a moment since,
had heard himself described as a wretch
by Armande, and without being moved
by this indignity when it came from the
lips of a young girl, who believed the horrors
which she had heard recounted of
the Prince Puzzano, Giacomo, we say,
felt irritated at the tone in which the
Duke de Nevers spoke of him, although
there was nothing strange in it, when uttered
by a nobleman in reference to a
muleteer.</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," replied Giacomo, "I
have wit; it is a family heritage, and
this heritage has been transmitted to me
inviolate."</p>

<p>The Duke de Nevers did not care to
understand this allusion, but Barati, who
was irritated at the unceremonious tone
with which the muleteer had accosted
him, gave force to the hint by a smile and
a glance, the meaning of which could
not be mistaken, and the duke exclaimed
angrily:</p>

<p>"What means the knave?"</p>

<p>"Less violence, my lord duke," said
Giacomo, "I fear neither great names
nor great airs, nor great swords. I have
serious affairs to discuss with you, and
calmness is necessary for us both. Master
Barati, arrange it so that no one can
overhear us."</p>

<p>Barati, persuaded that an emissary of
the Princess Puzzano stood before him,
carefully closed the doors, and said to Giacomo:</p>

<p>"What news do you bring?"</p>

<p>"Very important news, master; news
of the arrival of Giacomo Spaffa, Prince
of Puzzano."</p>

<p>Barati changed color, and cast a
glance of embarrassment at the duke.</p>

<p>"I know," said Giacomo, who divined

<!-- page 127 col 2 -->

the motive of the advocate's fears, "I
know that the Duke de Nevers is ill
disposed toward the family of Puzzano,
since he has promised Mademoiselle Armande
de Lostanges to break off your
marriage with her, by revealing to her
father that you had admonished the
princess to remove the proofs of her
son Giacomo's existence, but I know,
also, master, that you possess a letter
which can impose silence on the duke,
whenever you please to use it, and I
cannot suppose that you have been so
imprudent as to restore it to him, although
it is for that purpose that he is
here."</p>

<p>At these words the duke and Barati
gazed at each other as if stupefied, and
the latter replied hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Who has told you that? Whence
know you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That shall be explained to you in
due time and place," said Giacomo, "but
before we go farther, answer me. What
are these suspicions of the parliament
relative to Giacomo's existence, and
what measures should the princess adopt
for her son's safety?"</p>

<p>The tone and language of this man was
well calculated to produce the impression
that he was intimately acquainted
with the relations of the Princess of Puzzano
with Barati. Still the latter hesitated
to answer in the duke's presence,
but Giacomo, who divined the motive
of his embarrassment, added:</p>

<p>"If the Duke de Nevers is not one
of ours, it is merely because he has not
carefully reflected upon his interest:
I engage to prove it to him in a moment.
Speak in his presence then, speak without
fear."</p>

<p>"In truth," replied the advocate, "there
is but little to be said after that which
you have just told the duke yourself.
Information has been given that the
Prince Giacomo of Puzzano is still in
existence; his arrest has been demanded
of the parliament; parliament has engaged
to give him up, and it was expected
that a clue might be traced to
his movements by seizing the princess'
papers."</p>

<p>"I know all that," said Giacomo,
who for the last few moments had been
scrutinizing a rich casket which stood

<!-- page 128 col 1 -->

upon the desk of the advocate. "After
having been informed of this design
by M. de Lostanges, you gave the princess
timely warning, and for that service
she has richly rewarded you."</p>

<p>"How," cried Barati, "Compassion
alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And this casket, which was not
placed empty in your hands. It was that
which determined you."</p>

<p>"This casket," said the advocate,
turning pale.</p>

<p>"I know more about it than you, more
even than the princess," said Giacomo,
taking it into his hands; "your portion
was here," he continued, as he opened it,
while the duke and the advocate gazed
at him with astonishment. "That of monseigneur
was here," he added, raising the
false bottom with the point of his poignard,
and drawing from the casket a magnificent
necklace of diamonds, which he presented
to the Duke de Nevers. "The
princess has charged me to place it in
his hands, as a testimonial of her thanks
for the silence which he will observe
concerning this affair."</p>

<p>As we have said, Giacomo's great
art was, with wonderful quickness and
presence of mind, to draw advantage
from the slightest circumstances which
offered themselves. The sight of this
casket, which he had given to his mother,
and with the secret with which he alone
was acquainted, had explained the words
of Armande, when she said that it was
not from generosity that Barati had
saved the Princess of Puzzano. Still
the manner in which Giacomo assailed
the probity of the duke might have been
hazardous, if he had not previously
overwhelmed him as well as Barati with
astonishment, by revealing what he knew
of their secrets, and in such a way as
to lead them to believe that he was still
more accurately acquainted with them.
Giacomo had no sooner observed the
eager glance which M. de Nevers cast
upon the necklace, than he formed a
correct estimate of the man with whom
he was dealing. Whatever refusals,
whatever grimaces the duke's pride
might oppose to him, he was sure that
he had touched the weak spot in his
character, and he continued:</p>

<p>"And now, master Barati, let us hear

<!-- page 128 col 2 -->

no more of the past, with which I am
acquainted as well as you; let us speak
of the present. What does the parliament
know concerning the Prince of
Puzzano?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems," said Barati, who
spoke like a man in the presence of a
supernatural being, "it seems that they
are informed of the expected arrival of
the prince."</p>

<p>"I have just told you that he has
already arrived."</p>

<p>"Has he brought his crew with
him?"</p>

<p>"You interrogate, master Barati, and
you do not answer."</p>

<p>Barati cast another glance at the
duke.</p>

<p>"But the duke is one of our friends,
I say," replied Giacomo, "for if he does
not find the chain which binds him to us
of sufficient strength, it can at last be
lengthened by a few rows of pearls of
the purest lustre."</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried the duke.</p>

<p>"The galleon which the Prince of
Puzzano captured off the Canaries, contained
an admirable store of them," said
Giacomo.</p>

<p>The word galleon was applied at that
time to a vessel laden with gold, and this
remark opened a vast field to the hopes
of a man, whose silence it was necessary
to purchase. The effect of this
word was so powerful that the duke repeated
it and said:</p>

<p>"A galleon! he has seized a galleon!"</p>

<p>This exclamation of delight and surprise
was accompanied by a mechanical
gesture with which the duke thrust
the necklace into his pocket. Giacomo
observed it and resumed:</p>

<p>"Have no anxiety, master Barati, as
to what the prince has done with his
crew; he has placed them in safety, but
that which I wish to know is this.&mdash;What
information has reached the ears
of parliament concerning certain intrigues
against the State and the catholic
religion, and in which&mdash;"</p>

<p>This point was the point upon which
Giacomo wished to be enlightened, and
upon which he could not avow his ignorance,
having assumed the air of a man
so accurately informed of the princess'
secrets. Barati replied:</p>

<!-- page 129 col 1 -->

<p>"Why, you well know how matters
stand. Although an exile, the princess
of Puzzano is allied to families which
cannot be assailed without fair pretext.
They have taken advantage of some visits
made to the princess by a petty
seigneur of the mountain, a certain Baron
de la Roque, who is suspected of being
closely connected with the protestants
of the Cevennes, who are disposed, it is
said, to profit by the misunderstanding
which has occurred between the king
and the pope, concerning the declaration
of the French clergy to raise their heads
again. Hence the princess has been accused
of participation in their project of
revolt; but there is no truth in it. You
know that."</p>

<p>"It matters not," said Giacomo, "in
affairs of religion one cannot take too
many precautions, and it was imprudent
in the princess to receive the visits of
the Baron de la Roque."</p>

<p>"The business is ended, entirely
ended," said Barati. "The baron has
returned to his castle. But I am of your
opinion; I think that the princess will
do well to avoid all communication with
him, now that they dwell at some distance
from each other. But there is one
point upon which she should be upon her
guard; you know that the prince, who
was condemned for having devoted
himself to the occult sciences, kept a
laboratory in his mother's house."</p>

<p>"We are now in France," said Giacomo,
"and the royal decree, which
abolishes all accusations against sorcery,
that this accusation cannot be interpreted
as a crime."</p>

<p>"Without doubt," said Barati, "but
the existence of a chemical laboratory
would be none the less dangerous on
that account."</p>

<p>Giacomo did not comprehend him, but
he hesitated to question him more closely,
when the duke, desirous to display
his wit, interrupted them:</p>

<p>"Master Barati is right," he said,
"the king has just established a <i>chambre
ardente</i> to discover and prosecute the
band of poisoners, who now invest
France, and the gentlemen of the robe
are too eager to gain their fees, not to
see a manufactory of poison wherever
they meet with an alembic or a crucible."</p>

<!-- page 129 col 2 -->

<p>These words produced a strange effect
upon Giacomo; they recalled to his mind
the calumny of which he had been the
object&mdash;a calumny which accused him
of having hastened his father's decease,
and he muttered in a stifled voice:</p>

<p>"Oh! everywhere the same blind
and ferocious justice! It matters not,"
he resumed, "the Princess of Puzzano
will take care not to subject herself to
such a suspicion."</p>

<p>He was then silent. Barati, who had
divined that this man was more than he
appeared to be, now turned to him, and
said:</p>

<p>"Is this all that you wish to know?"</p>

<p>These words reminded Giacomo of
the promise which he had given to Armande,
and he felt somewhat embarrassed
how to keep it; but Barati's question required
an answer. Impelled by that
spirit of adventure, which took delight in
the most complicated intrigues, the prince
replied:</p>

<p>"It is indeed all that I wished to know,
sir; but it is not all that I wished to say
to you. You are desirous of espousing
Mademoiselle de Lostanges, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter known to all the
world."</p>

<p>"But it is known also to all the world
that she is greatly averse to this marriage."</p>

<p>"Maiden's caprice!" said Barati peevishly.</p>

<p>"A caprice which has not hesitated to
apply to the Duke de Nevers, to break
off this projected union?"</p>

<p>"A union which I oppose no longer,"
said M. de Nevers.</p>

<p>"But one that another opposes," rejoined
Giacomo.</p>

<p>"And this other?" inquired Barati.</p>

<p>Giacomo's visage assumed a singular
expression of joyous irony, as he replied:</p>

<p>"This other is a gentleman of passably
good mien, sir&mdash;a gentleman who
handles his sword indifferently well, and
who is infinitely interested in the beautiful
demoiselle de Lostanges."</p>

<p>"I know him," said Barati.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," rejoined Giacomo.</p>

<p>"It would be strange," said the duke,
"if M. Barati did not know him, since

<!-- page 130 col 1 -->

they have had an encounter together, and
the poor fellow is, in consequence of it,
lying in his bed at this very moment."</p>

<p>"But there is another," said Giacomo,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Another?" repeated the advocate.</p>

<p>"Another, Master Barati," said Giacomo,
"who has charged me to tell you
that if you present yourself to-morrow at
the hotel of M. De Lostanges to sign the
contract, you may indeed leave it for the
church; but in that case there will not
be a marriage service rehearsed there,
but a mass for the dead."</p>

<p>"You can bear back for answer to
him who has charged you with such a
message," said Barati, in a firm tone;
"that I shall repair to-morrow to the
hotel of the president, and that I will remain
for an hour before his door, in order
to await the man who may feel disposed
to speak with me."</p>

<p>"Sir advocate," said Giacomo, "if he
to whom I refer were inclined to honor
you so far as to measure swords with
you, he would not have directed me to
warn you, he would have come himself
in person, but he has other means to rid
himself of a rival."</p>

<p>"Assassination, perhaps!" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"He is not the man to stick at it,"
said Giacomo, "if you compel him; but
he thinks that you will be so accommodating,
as to listen to the reasons which
he has directed me to repeat to you."</p>

<p>"Sir, I neither can nor will listen to
anything on this subject," said Barati.
"I love Mademoiselle de Lostanges; I
have her father's promise, and she shall
be mine, or I will perish."</p>

<p>Giacomo smiled at the resolution displayed
by Barati, and he replied gaily:</p>

<p>"Well, then. Master Barati, since you
push things to this pass, and are ready
to brave death sooner than renounce your
bride, you shall receive no personal injury;
I promise this, and still you shall
not espouse the fair demoiselle."</p>

<p>"We shall see."</p>

<p>"Oh! all is arranged," said Giacomo.
"I observe, with pleasure, that there are
no means to terrify you; you will compel
us to force you."</p>

<p>"I despise your menaces," said Barati.</p>

<!-- page 130 col 2 -->

<p>"Very well, master advocate," replied
Giacomo, "the man who sets the
price upon his services, which you set
upon yours, should confine his scorn to
himself. Reflect upon my words; a
promise has been given to Mademoiselle
de Lostanges that this marriage
shall be broken off, and if by day-break
to-morrow, a letter from you has not dissolved
it, you will see that promise fulfilled
in your presence. As to you, M. de
Nevers, I have a few words to say to
you in private. Will you have the goodness
to follow me?"</p>

<p>The duke readily complied, and, accompanied
by Giacomo, left the dwelling
of the advocate. The latter was stupefied
at what had occurred, but firmly resolved
to brave the threats that had been
uttered against him.</p>

<p>Scarcely were Giacomo and the duke
alone, when our adventurer, with that
spirit of audacity which characterized
him, said:</p>

<p>"You have not surmised who I am,
M. de Nevers."</p>

<p>"In truth," replied the latter, "unless
you are the prince of Puzzano himself, I
do not see who you can be."</p>

<p>"Duke de Nevers," rejoined Giacomo,
"you have hit the mark, and I am
delighted to find that you have understood
me better than yonder gownsman; I have
hopes now that we can come to an agreement
on every point."</p>

<p>The duke hesitated to reply, and the
prince continued:</p>

<p>"You have seen my mother, have you
not? you are acquainted with my sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," said the duke, with a
warmth which proved that the subject
was by no means indifferent to him.</p>

<p>"You bear a noble name," said Giacomo,
"but to this name there is a
splendor wanting which you are unable
to give to it. A marriage with a rich
heiress could invest it with this splendor.
Leonore is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Without doubt," said the duke, "and
if I had listened to my heart alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is wealthy," interrupted Giacomo,
"and her wealth consists in a fortune
which should please you better than
any other; for it will not be necessary
to render an account of it, because it is
impossible to invest it in her own name.

<!-- page 131 col 1 -->

For if this were done, inquiries might be
made as to the means by which it has
been acquired, and it might be difficult
to give the requisite information.</p>

<p>"I comprehend you," said the duke,
"and it would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two millions shall be placed in your
hands on the day when the contract is
signed, and you will merely settle upon
my sister a dowry of a hundred thousand
crowns. Does the affair suit you?"</p>

<p>"Admirably."</p>

<p>"Well, then, be at Mirepoix to-morrow
evening; I cannot accompany you
thither, for in the morning I must keep
my word with Barati."</p>

<p>"You are resolved to prevent this marriage
then?"</p>

<p>"I have promised Mademoiselle de
Lostanges to do so."</p>

<p>"How did you become acquainted
with her?"</p>

<p>"That is my secret. To-morrow, then,
at Mirepoix."</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"One word more. Is this Armande
beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Very beautiful; but since you have
given her this promise, you must know
her."</p>

<p>"I have never seen her."</p>

<p>"You jest!"</p>

<p>"Do you forget that I have dealings
with supernatural beings?" said Giacomo,
laughing.</p>

<p>"That troubles me but little," said the
duke, "but do not forget that suspicions
are aroused concerning you, and that you
are very imprudent to meddle with an
affair, which is entirely indifferent to
you."</p>

<p>"That is the charm of it," said Giacomo.
"And then&mdash;you have told me
that this Armande is beautiful. Adieu
until to-morrow!"</p>

<p>With these words Giacomo departed,
and entered a house in which, at a later
period the events occurred which we
have already related.</p>

<p>On the following day, the young advocate
sallied forth in his gayest attire,
accompanied by a domestic, upon whose
fidelity he could depend. He wore concealed
beneath his dress, a long poignard,
and he had confirmed himself in his determination
to real force by force. As

<!-- page 131 col 2 -->

he walked from his own dwelling to that
of the President de Lostanges, he proceeded
onward with watchful eye, scrutinizing
the mien, the gait, the gesture,
and even the expression of the countenance
of those who passed near him.</p>

<p>Still he met nothing to excite his suspicions
that the menaces which he had
heard on the preceding evening, would
be put in execution, at least by any violent
means. When he reached the
hotel of M. de Lostanges, however, he
perceived, seated upon one of the benches,
which stood on either side of the gate,
a man, who rose when he beheld him,
and bowed to him with a singular expression
of sarcasm.</p>

<p>This individual was the inn-keeper
Vergnes, who was at that time young, but
who, even then, opened his house to the
gay suppers of the students of the University,
and to the wild revels of the
officers. Like all his fellow students,
Barati had been an occasional visitor at
this house, and it was not surprising that
Vergnes should smile at meeting one of
his old acquaintances, as he gravely entered
the abode of his affianced bride to
sign his marriage contract.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, however, Barati
was so alarmed at this encounter, that he
paused upon the threshold of the door,
and followed the inn-keeper with his
eyes, as the latter hurried onward with
rapidity. His fears rose to such a pitch
that he despatched his domestic in pursuit
of the man, and entered the hotel
de Lostanges alone.</p>

<p>With all the apparent, and oftentimes
real strictness which characterized the
morals of the magistrates at this epoch,
yet no father, in marrying his daughter
to a young man of twenty-five, imagined
that he was bestowing her upon
a youth who could not be reproached
with some slight follies. But follies
which a father knows in his own heart,
yet of which he feigns to be ignorant,
and which he readily pardons, may become
an insurmountable obstacle if they
are brought forward in a way to give
rise to scandal, and above all, if they
are cast as a reproach upon the bridegroom
in the presence of a bride, who
would gladly grasp at an opportunity of
branding as an unpardonable crime, that

<!-- page 132 col 1 -->

which the sex is usually ready to forgive,
namely, a few past gallantries.</p>

<p>While he slowly ascended the steps
of the hotel, Barati, disturbed in spite of
himself by the presence of Vergnes, recalled
to mind all the follies of which he
could be accused; he racked his brain
to recall, if, by any chance, he had left
in the hands of this man the unsettled
account of some jovial night, and sure
of having placed his affairs in perfect
order on this score, he was vexed at himself
for this strange and unaccountable
alarm.</p>

<p>When he entered the saloon of his
father-in-law, the latter, his wife, his
daughter and a few friends, were already
awaiting him. The reception which he
met with from M. de Lostanges was most
cordial. Barati seemed sure of success.
Madame de Lostanges appeared embarrassed,
but Armande received him with
an air of triumph. Her glance, her
smile was fraught with an ease, a carelessness
which recalled his fears again.</p>

<p>But he was one of those men whose
courage and obstinacy increase in the
face of danger; he cast a rapid glance
around him, and seeing none but familiar
faces, he felt convinced that the danger
had not yet appeared, although Armande
had doubtless been warned that some one
would come to her assistance.</p>

<p>After the usual compliments and congratulations,
Barati took from beneath
his habit a portfolio of considerable size,
and reaching it carelessly to the notary,
he said:</p>

<p>"I beg you to ascertain the sum
which is contained in this portfolio, and
which constitutes my <i>apport</i> in this contract.
You will find therein two hundred
and twenty thousand livres which
are to be at once converted into specie.
The two hundred thousand livres will
be specified in the contract. As to the
remaining twenty thousand, I offer them
as a gift of love to Mademoiselle de
Lostanges, to use at her discretion for
her attire and her pleasures."</p>

<p>Barati had counted upon the effect of
this princely liberality, and it was well
suited to the age. He was not deceived
in his expectation. All present cried
out in admiration; Madame de Lostanges

<!-- page 132 col 2 -->

cast a glance upon her daughter, as
if to say:</p>

<p>"My child, there are few husbands
like, this, mark me!"</p>

<p>Armande herself was greatly embarrassed;
she glanced stealthily at Barati,
and said to herself that, except for that
horrible black habit which she detested,
he was quite tolerable, and that with
such a husband, a woman would be
envied, at least, even if she were not
happy.</p>

<p>The notary now began to read the
marriage contract.</p>

<p>The terms in which it was drawn up,
accounted for the preference which M.
de Lostanges evinced for Barati, and for
the firmness which he had displayed in
bringing about the accomplishment of
this union. As the clauses of this contract
explain, and perhaps justify some
events which we are about to recount,
we request the reader's permission to repeat
the principal ones; firstly, and to
account for the interest which M. de
Lostanges displayed in this marriage,
the dowry which he allotted to his daughter
was but fifteen thousand livres, while
Barati's <i>apport</i> was two hundred thousand;
secondly, the <i>apport</i> of Barati fell
to his wife in case of his decease, even
if there were children; and this <i>apport</i>
fell to her as her own property, that is to
say, her rights took precedence of those
of the children, if there should be any,
and all claims on the part of Barati's
family were entirely excluded. Thus
much concerning the interests of the
family of Lostanges. As to those of
Barati, they consisted in a full and complete
donation of all the property of M.
de Lostanges to his daughter, but only in
case of the existence of children born
from the marriage of Barati and Armande.
In case there were no children,
Armande had merely a life interest in
this property, and at her death, it reverted
to the president's nephews.</p>

<p>The rehearsal of this contract had already
lasted for more than an hour, and
still nothing announced the slightest probability
of interruption. Barati took courage,
and it was now Armande's turn to
be agitated; that she was so, was evident
from the frequent glances which she
directed towards the clock which stood

<!-- page 133 col 1 -->

in a corner of the saloon. It seemed to
her as if the notary devoured the pages
of the contract, while Barati could
scarcely refrain from bidding him quicken
his slow and monotonous utterance.</p>

<p>The reading was at last ended, however,
and nothing now remained but for
the parties to affix their signatures to the
contract. As usually happens after a
prolonged sitting, all present rose, and
went one by one to pay the unmeaning
compliments which are expected on such
occasions. Armande's eyes were fastened
upon the door; she seemed to invoke
the unknown rescuer, whom she
expected, but who still delayed to appear.</p>

<p>The pen was presented to M. de Lostanges
and his wife; they both signed
their names; it was then passed to Barati,
who affixed his signature, and at last
the turn came to Mademoiselle de Lostanges.
All present gazed upon her,
for her aversion to this marriage was
well known. She took the pen, and casting
a despairing glance around the apartment,
advanced trembling toward the
table, but at the moment when she had
reached it, she paused, with her eyes
fixed steadfastly before her.</p>

<p>"Sign it, my daughter, sign it!" said
her father, sternly.</p>

<p>Armande confused, could only answer:</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The contract! this!" said M. de
Lostanges.</p>

<p>But he himself stood confounded at
seeing a large blank sheet of paper upon
the table. The contract had disappeared!</p>

<p>The occurrence seemed almost supernatural.
There was no one in the
saloon, except the family of Lostanges,
three or four friends, the notary, his
clerk and Barati. The effect may easily
be imagined which this singular disappearance
produced upon all the actors
in this scene, but particularly upon the
bridegroom, who thought every danger
had passed by, and upon Armande, who
at last had despaired of aid.</p>

<p>The first movement of each one present,
was to look under the table, to the
right hand and the left, the second was
to gaze in the faces of those around,

<!-- page 133 col 2 -->

though no one ventured to say to the
other:</p>

<p>"Did you remove the contract?"</p>

<p>"It is a silly trick!" cried Barati,
pale with anger, "and as some one present
must have practised it, I beg him
not to continue it so long as to compel
me to look upon it as an insult."</p>

<p>A universal cry of "M. Barati is
right! who has taken the contract?"
only increased the general embarrassment,
for it was an excuse for all. The
notary now began to feel uneasy, and
turning to his clerk, he said:</p>

<p>"Your eyes have not left the table;
they ought not to have left it! who is it
that has taken the contract? Speak out
at once, for I cannot think that you have
been guilty of such an act of audacity."</p>

<p>The clerk swore that he was perfectly
innocent.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, "I have not left
the saloon, you can search me, if you
please, for I cannot have swallowed it."</p>

<p>Barati was too familiar with the airs
of culprits, not to suspect the young
man from his very defence. The offer
of submitting to be searched is a common
trick of robbers, after they have once
conveyed their stolen goods to a place
of safety. He passed quickly behind
the clerk, and opened a small door which
was concealed by a piece of tapestry,
and was situated directly behind the table
at which the notary was seated. He
stooped hastily, and picked up a loose
sheet upon which the notary had taken
notes, and which had been left in the
contract, and must have been dropped at
the moment when the latter had been
removed; he pointed it out to all present,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"That is the spot through which the
contract has passed!"</p>

<p>"And this is the spot where it re-enters,"
answered the voice of a man,
who had opened the opposite door of the
saloon, so gently as to be unheard amid
the general disturbance.</p>

<p>Every eye was turned towards him,
and they beheld a man of lofty statute
and imposing features, standing in a
proud attitude before them. He was
richly clad, in Spanish costume, which
was covered with embroidery, and embellished
with diamond buttons, a silken

<!-- page 134 col 1 -->

net confined his long black hair, and a
poignard of rare splendor shone at his
girdle. In addition to this, he wore a
rapier, a weapon somewhat out of fashion,
but the richness of which well accorded
with the peculiar elegance of his
attire. Armande gazed upon him with
a delight which was soon changed to
timid admiration at the singular beauty
of this bold intruder. All present were
stupefied, when they beheld this man,
who announced himself with such audacity,
holding in his hand the contract
which had so strangely disappeared.</p>

<p>Barati turned pale, and his face assumed
an expression of fury, as he recognised
in the untimely intruder the
muleteer, of the preceding evening.</p>

<p>But the scene which followed deserves
a separate chapter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">THE INTERRUPTED MARRIAGE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance of the muleteer inspired
Barati with so much the greater
alarm, as it was impossible for the young
advocate to know how far this man was
acquainted with the secrets of his life.
Besides, from the little which he had already
revealed to him, from the singular
freedom with which he had spoken on
the preceding evening, Barati had reason
to fear that he might disclose his
connection with the Princess of Puzzano,
for it was evident that he was a man to
hesitate at nothing.</p>

<p>At this moment Barati felt a keen
sensation of regret that he had not yielded
to the menaces which had been uttered
in his house, but at the next, the
obstinacy of his character gained the ascendent,
and he resolved, since the contest
was once commenced, to sustain it
to the end.</p>

<p>The President de Lostanges equally
surprised, had been more highly irritated
than any one present, at the entrance of
this stranger into an assemblage so private,
and but for the astonishment which held
him breathless at the sight of the missing
contract in the hands of the unknown,
it is probable that the latter would not

<!-- page 134 col 2 -->

for M. de Lostanges and his daughter to
understand it, but it was like a ray of
light to Barati, and he felt assured that
the man who thus announced himself,
could be no other than the Prince of
Puzzano. His first impulse was a desire
for vengeance, and he was upon the
point of proclaiming aloud the name of
the proscribed man, but notwithstanding
his fury, Barati paused at the sarcastic
glance with which Giacomo seemed to
challenge his hostility; he could not
imagine that this man would have thrown
himself thus imprudently into a danger
so imminent, without having secured the
means of escape, and, above all the
have had time to take the precautions
which secured him a prolonged hearing.</p>

<p>In truth, no sooner had he crossed the
threshold, than he carefully closed the
door behind him, drew to the bolts, so
that it could not be opened from without,
and with folded arms leaned his back
against it, waiting for some one to address
him.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what would
you?" said the president.</p>

<p>"I am he whom you seek," replied
Giacomo, "he whom your daughter expects,
and he, whom master Barati will
regret having endeavored to save."</p>

<p>This reply was not sufficiently clear
means to punish those who took part
against him. He kept silence therefore,
and resolved to await the issue of this
bold step before forming his resolution.
M. de Lostanges continued:</p>

<p>"This tells me neither who you are,
nor by what right you enter my house
thus rudely."</p>

<p>"It rested solely with M. Barati, to
prevent my entrance here; he had only
to remain away himself."</p>

<p>"Master Barati would have failed in
all the duties of a man of honor, had he
remained away," replied the president.</p>

<p>"He has failed in all the duties of a
man of prudence, and of an advocate
devoted to&mdash;those who pay him well
by coming here."</p>

<p>"I do not know this man!" exclaimed
Barati.</p>

<p>"But who are you?" rejoined the
president, "we have heard enough of
insolence, and should I call my servants&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 135 col 1 -->

<p>"Your servants will not answer your
summon," said Giacomo, drawing his
rapier, "and you will have the kindness
to listen to me patiently. Reassure
yourself, madam," he added, addressing
Madame de Lostanges, "and you, likewise,
my beautiful demoiselle, more
beautiful than I could have believed you
to be. I have no desire to employ violence
here; but since master Barati has
thought fit to slight the counsel which
was given him yesterday, and has left
his dwelling, it has been necessary for
me to come and consult him here, concerning
an affair which greatly interests
him."</p>

<p>"This is not the proper moment, sir,"
said Barati, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know better than any one
else," replied Giacomo, interrupting him,
"that I cannot dispose of my time as
you can, and for an advocate, who should
set store by a client, who recompenses
him so liberally, you should have shown
more complaisance than you have done."</p>

<p>"Enough, sir," cried Barati. "If M.
de Lostanges will permit me, I am at
your service. Restore that contract;
Mademoiselle de Lostanges is about to
sign it, that done, I will refuse you
neither my time nor my counsels."</p>

<p>The tone in which Barati pronounced
these words had an accent of provocation
in them which showed with sufficient
clearness in what sense they were
to be understood by him to whom they
were addressed; but Giacomo laughed,
and replied:</p>

<p>"It is this very contract marriage that
I need, master Barati, and if you had
deigned to wait for me this morning,
I would have told you wherefore. But
since you have not thought fit to do so,
I will explain myself. Do not grow impatient
M. de Lostanges, my explanation
will not be very long, and perhaps
you, in your turn, will thank me for the
interruption which I have been obliged
to occasion to this ceremony."</p>

<p>"Speak! speak then!" rejoined M. de
Lostanges.</p>

<p>It is probable that the president would
not long have endured the presence of
this intruder, and that, at all risks, he
would have summoned his domestics;
but Barati's paleness, the agitation that

<!-- page 135 col 2 -->

was visible beneath the air of menace
with which he gazed upon the unknown,
the delight of his daughter; all seemed
to prove that this intervention was
prompted by a motive, which his honor
as a father rendered it his duty to learn.</p>

<p>"I thank you, M. de Lostanges," said
Giacomo, "the affair is pressing; you
shall judge to what extent, and I will
wager that M. Barati will comprehend
still more clearly than yourself, that it
is his interest as well as his duty to
assist me in arranging matters this very
day. He will comprehend also why this
contract which has been drawn up so
admirably, is the very one which we
need in the other affair to which I refer."</p>

<p>"You refer then to a marriage?" said
M. de Lostanges.</p>

<p>"Yes, in truth," said Giacomo, gazing
at Barati with so significant an expression
that the suspicion flashed across the
minds of ail present that the advocate
was entangled by some secret ties, "yes,
in truth, and I hope that master Barati
will understand how necessary the
present contract is to us, for the names
need only to be changed, and the position
of the parties reversed."</p>

<p>These ambiguous words excited general
astonishment. Barati like the rest,
pondered upon their true meaning with
the most anxious curiosity. The air of
meaning with which Giacomo uttered
these words seemed to convey a hint that
was by no means unwelcome to him.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," said Barati.</p>

<p>"The case stands thus. There is a
young maiden of high birth, who, during
the absence of her brother has received
the visits of a young man. Although
these visits have occurred in the
presence of her mother, yet her brother,
who has returned only within the last
two days, does not look upon them with
such indifference; in his eyes they appear
calculated to injure the good name
of his sister, and he insists upon their
marriage."</p>

<p>Barati gazed with open eyes on the
speaker; all present regarded him
with astonishment, but M. de Lostanges
replied with some warmth.</p>

<p>"Even if all this were true, I do not
see how this contract can be useful to
you."</p>

<!-- page 136 col 1 -->

<p>"Have I not said," replied Giacomo,
with an air of irony, "that it would suffice
to change the names, and reverse
the position of the parties."</p>

<p>"But to what position do you refer,"
cried Barati.</p>

<p>"In the contract required between
the young maiden and the young man
in question, it is not the bridegroom who
possesses some hundred thousand livres,
it is the bride who possesses millions;
but by a strange concurrence of circumstances
the husband is to be benefitted
at the expense of his wife, as
Mademoiselle de Lostanges is benefitted
in this contract at the expense of master
Barati. A better model for such a
contract cannot be found, since the notary
of the village where the ceremony
is to take place is far from being as skilful
as those of Toulouse, and it is for
this reason that I have come to obtain it."</p>

<p>During the last few moments the possibility
of a marriage between himself
and Mademoiselle Leonore of Puzzano,
had presented itself vaguely to Barati's
mind. Had he not visited her in
the absence of her brother? might
not the young girl have become enamoured
of him, and have declared her
passion when she saw the object of it
about to escape her by a marriage with
another? In addition to this, was she
not compelled to place in the hands of
her husband an immense fortune, the
origin of which could not be explained,
(for the mention of the galleon returned incessantly
to Barati's mind), did not all this
designate Mademoiselle Leonore of Puzzano
as the young girl in question; and
did not the opposition which the Unknown
offered to his marriage with Mademoiselle
de Lostanges, point him out as
the man for whom this illustrious and
magnificent alliance was reserved?</p>

<p>At that moment Leonore's millions,
necklaces of diamonds, and the galleon
danced before Barati's eyes, like so
many dazzling phantoms; he cast a
wandering glance around the apartment,
while all present gazed with astonishment
at the expression of indecision
which had succeeded the air of
gloomy resolve that shone in his features
at the commencement of this scene.</p>

<p>Giacomo, who saw that he was half

<!-- page 136 col 2 -->

vanquished, continued in the same ironic
tone in which he had hitherto spoken:</p>

<p>"We cannot dispense with master
Barati," he said, "in drawing up a deed
so important, and I have come hitherto
beg him to accompany me. A dowry
of two millions in favor of the bridegroom,
should not be bestowed without
due precautions. M. Barati's presence is
absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>"What have you to answer, sir?"
cried M. de Lostanges, indignant at the
advocate's silence.</p>

<p>"In truth," replied Barati, stammering,
"I did not know&mdash;I could not foresee&mdash;"</p>

<p>An appeal to the advocate's honor and
probity would still, perhaps, have restrained
him; but the president's indignation
decided the step to which the fascination
of these dazzling hopes so violently
impelled him.</p>

<p>"Enough, sir, enough!" cried M. de
Lostanges. "Go, and fulfil you contract
with some lost creature whom you
have beguiled and abandoned, and to
whom you return for the sake of gold.
Leave my house! leave it!"</p>

<p>Barati, thus addressed, raised his
eyes at this insult, and replied:</p>

<p>"The maiden of whom you speak is
worthy the respect of the universe."</p>

<p>"Come then!" said Giacomo, hurrying
him out of the apartment. Before
those present had recovered from their
confusion, they had both left the house.</p>

<p>Giacomo cast a glance of triumph on
Armande as he departed and he observed
that she wore an air of discontent; in
truth, she found herself abandoned with
extreme facility, and if one could have
read the secrets of her heart, it would
have been seen that Barati, chosen and
preferred by a rival like the one described,
no longer seemed so disagreeable to
her; then the man who whom she refused
appeared to gain by the exchange,
and it is always vexatious when those
we reject find a better bargain than that
of which we have deprived them. All
this so greatly abated the joy of Mademoiselle
de Lostanges that she was perfectly
sincere in the indignation which
she manifested at Barati's conduct and
tears which she shed at the humiliation
thus inflicted upon her.</p>

<!-- page 137 col 1 -->

<p>In the meanwhile Barati followed
Giacomo like a man in a dream, whose
steps are no longer guided by his reason.</p>

<p>When they reached the outer gate he
found a horse standing there, already
saddled and bridled.</p>

<p>"And now," said our adventurer, "to
Mirepoix! we must be there this evening."</p>

<p>The mention of the place where
the princess of Puzzano resided, served
to confirm Barati in the strange hope that
he had conceived; still, however, he detained
the unknown, who had exercised
so singular a power over him, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But who are you then?"</p>

<p>"Giacomo Spaffa, prince of Puzzano,"
replied the latter.</p>

<p>Barati gazed upon him for a moment
in alarm; every thing seemed at once
clear to him, and he said:</p>

<p>"Do you not accompany me?"</p>

<p>"I shall be at my mother's when you
arrive there, but I have some affairs yet
to arrange."</p>

<p>Barati mounted his horse, and spurred
upon the road to Mirepoix, but no sooner
had he left him, than Giacomo burst into
a fit of laughter, and cried:</p>

<p>"The jest is a good one, but the devil
seize me if I feel the courage to prolong
it during a ride of eight leagues; we will
bring it to an end this evening."</p>

<p>He still stood before the door of the
hotel de Lostanges, and turning towards
the window, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Yon maiden is beautiful as an angel;
I must see her again this very day."</p>

<p>Having taken this resolution, he wrapped
himself in the long Spanish mantle
that hung across his shoulders, and proceeded
toward the deserted street which
bordered the garden of M. de Lostanges.
The gate was locked.</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" he said to himself, "the
service which I have rendered this young
girl deserves some thanks, and if she had
the least wit she would have guessed
that I would return hither."</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken these words,
when he heard a slight cough behind
the gate. Giacomo took off his hat in
silence, raised his eyes to heaven, and
uttered these words:</p>

<!-- page 137 col 2 -->

<p>"Oh, woman! of whatever clime, of
whatever rank, you are and you always
will be, that portion of humanity, which
is the most crafty, and fondest of intrigue!"</p>

<p>Having said this, Giacomo knocked at
the gate. It was opened.</p>

<p>"Are you not contented with me?"
he said to Armande, as he beheld her
standing before him.</p>

<p>"Have you not kept your promise?"
she replied in a sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>"Not yet, for you do not think me so
stupid as to bestow upon this advocate a
happiness almost equal to that you have
refused him."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" cried Armande
in a tone of the liveliest joy.</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow at midnight, I
will be at this gate, and will explain all
to you."</p>

<p>"But I do not know that I can come,"
said Armande, blushing, "for I do not
know who you are."</p>

<p>"Who I am?" said Giacomo. "Why,
a man, who, to save you from suffering,
has risked his life, who will risk it again
to see you once more, were it but once."</p>

<p>"You terrify me!" said Armande.</p>

<p>"My name, if I should tell it to you,
would perhaps terrify you still more than
my words."</p>

<p>"But who are you? speak! that I may
know if I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, blushed, and dropping her
eyes to the ground, added:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A man whom you can send to the
scaffold, if you tell your father that he
will be waiting for you here day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Your name? for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Giacomo Spaffa, Prince
of Puzzano."</p>

<p>Armande uttered a cry, and Giacomo
closed the gate.</p>

<p>"If she does not leap from her window,"
he said as he withdrew, "rather
than fail to keep the appointment given
by the corsair, the sorcerer Puzzano&mdash;if
she does not put father and mother to
sleep with drugs, in order to hear and see
this detestable bandit, I know naught of
womankind, and will in future distrust the
curiosity and weakness of them all."</p>

<p>A moment after, Giacomo entered the

<!-- page 138 col 1 -->

abode of Vergnes, changed his dress, and
took the road to Mirepoix.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">DECEIVED HOPES.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left Barati spurring toward Mirepoix,
and Giacomo following him, after
having appointed a meeting with Armande
for the day after the morrow; let us accompany
them in their hasty journey,
which was replete with projects and reflections
for them both.</p>

<p>Giacomo, indeed, gave little thought to
the object of his errand to Mirepoix; his
plan had been traced out in advance; he
had performed the most difficult part of
his design, and he was on his way to
complete it, but during the interval it
scarcely entered his mind. It was the
peculiar characteristic of this man to devote
himself entirely to the present, and
to dismiss a purpose from his thoughts
as soon as he had arranged every thing
that could influence its result. The subject
which now occupied Giacomo's reflections
was a project which he had long
meditated, and which he hoped at last to
be enabled to put in operation.</p>

<p>But there was still another feature
in Giacomo's character, or rather in his
conduct, which in the eyes of others
might have appeared folly; at all times
and places he scattered words and gifts
about him, ninety-nine out of a hundred
of which were sterile, but one of which
coming opportunely to his aid at a time
more or less remote, amply repaid him
for his prodigality. We will notice some
which he strewed upon the road, in order
to explain our meaning.</p>

<p>He had scarcely ridden a league from
Toulouse, when his course was arrested
by the despairing cries of a mendicant
who complained that he had lost his dog,
and that he could no longer proceed upon
his way, as he was blind. He was
tall in figure, still young, and one, who,
but for this cruel infirmity, could certainly
gain his livelihood by the labor of
his hands. Any other than Giacomo
would have passed on without heeding
his cries, or would have been content

<!-- page 138 col 2 -->

with giving him a few sous; Giacomo
stopped, and having scrutinised the blind
man for a moment, he called to him.&mdash;The
poor fellow, guided by the sound of
his voice, made his way toward him as
well as he was able and Giacomo said
to him:</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend, I have vowed a
vow to St. James of Compostella, to
whose shrine I made a pilgrimage to obtain
the restoration of my sight, I have
vowed a vow, I say, to give a gold louis
to every blind man whom I might meet
upon my road. Stretch out your hand,
that I may fulfil this vow."</p>

<p>The blind man obeyed, and Giacomo
gravely placed in his hand a sou.</p>

<p>The mendicant's infirmity was not
proof against this disappointment, and he
cast the sou upon the ground, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"May St. James of Compostella render
you blind and deaf, forsworn pilgrim,
for having thus broken your vow."</p>

<p>Giacomo laughed aloud, and replied:</p>

<p>"I have made you a finer gift, knave,
than if I had bestowed upon you a louis,
for I have restored your sight. But listen
to me carefully. If to-morrow or
any time within twenty years, a man
accosts you, saying: '<i>To the rescue
of the black cavalier!</i>' then lend him
good aid, or the infirmity which you now
feign will become real, from the moment
when you refuse. Never forget either
this day or this hour, and that you may
be sure to remember them, here are three
bright louis."</p>

<p>Never did a man in the full possession
of his sight, cast a glance of greater astonishment
upon another, than the mendicant
cast upon Giacomo. He took the
three louis, while the cavalier said to
him:</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Fran&ccedil;ois Gali."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Fran&ccedil;ois Gali, remember
well that you have this day met with
a man who will make your fortune."</p>

<p>Giacomo now struck the spurs into
his steed, and disappeared. It may easily
be imagined that such an event must remain
forever engraved upon the memory
of the beggar. But how could this benefit
Giacomo? He did not know, but in
the adventurous life which he led, he
thus established so many points of support,

<!-- page 139 col 1 -->

so many chances of refuge and
safety. And such a mode of procedure
was the more likely to be useful
to him, as Giacomo remembered with
strange accuracy the words that he had
uttered in these encounters, the day and
the hour when they took place, and the
features of the individual whom he accosted.</p>

<p>During the short journey which he
took from Toulouse to Mirepoix, he profited
by every occasion which offered,
whether at an inn or farm house, to leave
behind him some unexpected and mysterious
token of his presence. We do
not intend to recount them all; but we
will mention one more, as it has some
reference to this narration.</p>

<p>While passing along a wretched road,
which led from D'Auterive to Sainte Gabelle,
Giacomo encountered a group of
individuals in festival attire; they were
some persons of rank, followed by a
crowd of peasants, all of whom seemed
very joyous and mirthful. Among them
was a tall and beautiful woman, holding
in her arms an infant who was clad in
rich swaddling clothes; it was evident
that this group were going to or returning
from a christening. Our adventurer
drew up by the road side, so as to stand at
the right hand of the little troop, and uncovered
his head. One of the individuals
who walked in the front of the band,
paused, saluted him, and said:</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, for your attention,
for I see from the station which you have
taken, that you know as well as we do,
that it is an unlucky omen, for a child
returning from a christening to encounter
a man upon a black steed on the left
side of the road."</p>

<p>"I not only wish, sir, that this meeting
may be harmless to the child," replied
Giacomo, "but I hope that it may
be fortunate for him. Whose child is
it, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is a son of M. D'Auterive's, and
that is his uncle and godfather, the Baron
de la Roque."</p>

<p>"I do not believe in ill omens," said
the latter, stepping forward, and speaking
in rather a scornful tone.</p>

<p>"But you will believe, perhaps, in the
kind wishes of a traveller toward this
child, when he pledges them in the name

<!-- page 139 col 2 -->

of his friends of the Cevennes," replied
Giacomo, with a mind always awake to
the slightest word which could recall a
reminiscence.</p>

<p>The astonishment which was visible
in the features of the young baron rendered
Giacomo an object of singular curiosity,
which was by no means diminished
by his subsequent words and actions.</p>

<p>He leaped from his horse, approached
the nurse, and presenting her with a
small golden medal, which was attached
to a silken cord, he said:</p>

<p>"Fasten this precious relic about the
neck of the child. It is one of the coins
from that treasure found by Raymond at
Antioch, a great number of which he deposited
upon the holy sepulchre, that
they might be distributed as objects of
sanctity among those of his vassals who
had followed him. He who wears one
of them is sure of success in every enterprise
he undertakes."</p>

<p>All present made the sign of the cross
at these words, and Giacomo, lowering
his voice, so as to be heard by the nurse
alone, continued:</p>

<p>"As to you, woman, you will teach
this child, as soon as it can speak, the
maxim which is written in sacred characters
upon this piece of gold. This
maxim is, that, '<i>speech is silver, but silence
is gold</i>.' And do you also observe
this precious maxim, and feel assured
that on the day when the child shall
hear these words pronounced, fortune
will not be far distant."</p>

<p>After having uttered this admonition,
which he accompanied with a few lines,
Giacomo departed, saying to the Baron
de la Roque:</p>

<p>"The seventh day from this, will be
a happy one for him who does not fear
to visit the exiles."</p>

<p>This incident, like the one previously
related, was calculated to make a lively
impression upon the mind, in a country,
and at an epoch which were far from being
destitute of superstitious notions, and
when those, who, like the baron, affected
to despise them, were considered as
godless and irreligious.</p>

<p>It was in this manner that Giacomo
employed his time while upon the road
to Mirepoix. He had rendered his journey

<!-- page 140 col 1 -->

much shorter, by passing through
Sainte Gabeile, thus avoiding Saverdun
and Pamiers, which were situated upon
the usual route, where he might have
encountered Barati. Beside this, Giacomo
did not spare the spur, and notwithstanding
his delays, and the late
hour at which he left Toulouse, he reached
Mirepoix before the advocate.</p>

<p>As to Barati, nothing could divert his
thoughts from the scene which had just
passed at the house of M. de Lostanges,
and from that which was about to take
place, doubtless, at the dwelling of the
princess of Puzzano.</p>

<p>Reflection convinced him of the unworthiness
of his conduct, and perhaps
of his imprudence, and if he could have
retraced his steps, he would have preferred
the union which he had so carelessly
abandoned, to that which had been
so suddenly and mysteriously offered to
him; but the rupture had been formal
and public, and his only hope now lay
in the success of the enterprise in which
he was at present engaged. Once in
this train of thought, he reflected upon
the prospect offered by the future, and
he adorned it with colors so rich and
glowing, that he reached Mirepoix in a
kind of pleasant intoxication, from which
he was destined to be but too rudely
aroused.</p>

<p>He inquired of a person whom he met,
if he could point him to the abode of the
princess of Puzzano. The individual
thus addressed was a round and ruddy
canon, but no sooner had he heard the
name of the princess of Puzzano, than
he scowled and answered:</p>

<p>"She dwells where such a woman
ought to dwell, for it was very natural
that the mother of a sorcerer should
take up her lodgings in the house of a
heretic."</p>

<p>"Let the house belong to whom it
may," said Barati, "I beg you to direct
me to it, for I must see the princess this
evening."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the canon, "retrace
your steps, and fronting the convent,
on your right hand, you will see
a large double door, with a devil's claw,
holding an apple for a knocker. That
is the house that belongs to that son of
perdition, called Bayle, and it is there

<!-- page 140 col 2 -->

that the princess of Puzzano has chosen
to dwell."</p>

<p>Barati pursued the path which had
been pointed out to him, but he could
not prevent himself from remarking the
singular concurrence of circumstances,
which, on every occasion, helped to foster
the prejudices which existed against
the family of Puzzano.</p>

<p>Barati reached the house, and knocked
at the door. It was opened in silence;
he entered, and it was closed upon him
with the same precaution. A domestic
led him through a long corridor until he
reached a saloon upon the ground floor,
which opened probably upon the garden,
but all the windows of which were carefully
closed.</p>

<p>When he entered he beheld seated
around a table, upon which stood lighted
tapers of green wax, the princess of
Puzzano and her daughter Leonore,
then scarcely fifteen years of age, but
already giving promise of that majestic
beauty, which she was destined to retain
to such an age, that the infant which
Giacomo had just met upon his journey
would one day become enamoured of
her. A man in black attire, was also
seated at the table, whom Barati judged
to be the notary. A gentleman whom
he did not know stood in the corner of
the saloon, conversing with Giacomo,
and to the advocate's great astonishment,
he beheld also the Duke de Nevers,
dressed with extraordinary splendor.</p>

<p>Still there was nothing yet which
could alarm Barati, although the presence
of the duke was disagreeable to him.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he entered the saloon,
when Giacomo advanced to meet him,
took him by the hand, and led him to his
mother.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "be grateful to
M. Barati for his presence here, since,
for the sake of rendering us the service
which we expect of him, he has left unfinished
the most important act of a
man's life."</p>

<p>"I am aware of the devotion of Master
Barati, and I thank him for the evidence
which he now gives us of it," replied
the princess with a dignity so cold
and icy that it seemed little in accordance
with the reception due to a future
son-in-law.</p>

<!-- page 141 col 1 -->

<p>Barati gazed at Giacomo, whose coolness
was imperturbable, and who then
led him to his sister, saying:</p>

<p>"You have not erred in your praise of
Master Barati, my sister; you see that he
wishes to show himself worthy of the
good opinion which you have formed of
him."</p>

<p>This address did not much resemble
the presentation of a bridegroom to his
affianced bride, and the reply of Leonore
was by no means calculated to reassure
Barati.</p>

<p>"I thank Master Barati for his zeal,
and I am delighted to see him here. I
know that he is a prudent adviser, and I
feel sure that he will agree with me in
thinking that this contract has been drawn
up with unnecessary haste."</p>

<p>In whatever sense Barati interpreted
these words, the inference was lamentable
for him. If they were addressed to
him as an advocate and a councillor, it
was evident that he could not be the
bridegroom; if he supposed them addressed
to him as a bridegroom, the bride
had just openly declared that she was in
no haste to accomplish this union.</p>

<p>Still, the tone in which Leonore had
spoken was kind and friendly; a suspicion
now flashed across his mind; had he
been deceived by the ambiguous words
of the Prince of Puzzano; and had these
words been framed with an intent to entangle
him in a ridiculous snare? An
icy tremor shook his frame, and he was
about to interrogate Giacomo, when the
latter said:</p>

<p>"I hope, Master Barati, that you will
excuse the singularity of my conduct under
the present circumstances, but you
well know that every moment is precious
to a man whose life may be perilled by
the slightest indiscretion; I pray you to
read this contract, and tell me if it fulfills
the intention of which I spoke to you
this morning."</p>

<p>Barati took the contract, not to obey
the prince, but to obtain time, while he
feigned to read it, to form his resolution.
He glanced over it at first, raising his
eyes from time to time, to catch some
sign, some gesture, which might warn
him of what was passing. But all were
motionless and silent. "It is, perhaps, a
jest," he thought. He then read the

<!-- page 141 col 2 -->

contract more attentively, and saw that
it was drawn up entirely to the advantage
of the husband.</p>

<p>But Barati had by this time found
means to learn the truth, without betraying
the wild hopes which he had fostered,
hopes which vanished one by one as he
read the enumeration of the titles and
immense fortune of Leonore. How
could he have imagined that a woman so
nobly born, and who was related to the
highest families of France, of Italy, and
of Spain, would be sacrificed to a man of
his station, notwithstanding the position
to which she was reduced by the crimes
and condemnation of her brother. Barati
felt enraged at his own folly, and at him
who had so dexterously taken advantage
of it, and although not yet convinced
that he had been deceived, he rose with
an air of calmness, and tossed the contract
disdainfully upon the table.</p>

<p>"Well," said Giacomo, "what think
you of it?"</p>

<p>"I think that the contract has been
drawn up with great foresight for the interest
of him whom it concerns; but I
think also that the mother who should
sign it would be wanting in every duty,
and the man who should accept it would
be a wretch, descrying ignominy and
contempt."</p>

<p>These words did not fail to produce
the effect which Barati expected. The
duke started from his seat, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Have you brought this advocate
hither to insult me?"</p>

<p>The truth was now evident. Barati
had been tricked; he had been deceived
by the ambiguous phrases of Giacomo,
and the latter had fulfilled the threat
which he had uttered to break off his
marriage with Mademoiselle de Lostanges.
It was like a thunderstroke to him.
He was upon his guard, however, and
did not evince the slightest emotion at
the words of the Duke de Nevers.</p>

<p>"If my remark is insulting, monseigneur,"
he said, "you should not find fault
with me, for I was ignorant that they
could apply to any one here present.&mdash;The
Prince of Puzzano can bear witness
that I was not aware that this contract
concerned you."</p>

<p>"He is right, and he is a man of
sense also," said Giacomo. He then approached

<!-- page 142 col 1 -->

Barati, and added, in a low
voice: "you will pardon the jest, I hope.
I had passed my word, and as I trifled
with my own life to keep it, I might well
trifle with your ambition, to which I promise
ample amends."</p>

<p>"Promise for promise, monseigneur,"
replied Barati, in an under tone. "I
swear to you at this moment, and I will
prove that I know how to keep my oath,
swear that I will have vengeance for
this insult, be it in ten years, in twenty,
or at the hour of my death."</p>

<p>"You can do it on the instant, Master
Barati," said the prince, "for, although
the guard of this city consists of but six
soldiers, yet they are enough to arrest a
single man, above all, were you to put
yourself at their head."</p>

<p>Barati smiled disdainfully, and rejoined:</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself, monseigneur,
you are at this moment committing a
cruel wrong against your unhappy sister,
and I do not wish to prevent it. But
counting from the day after to-morrow,
remember that there lives a man who
has sworn your ruin. Now, if you will
permit it, the advocate and councillor will
perform his duty, in pointing out some
omissions which have been left in this
contract."</p>

<p>"Do so," said the prince, who, in
spite of his resolution, had been disturbed
by this threat, "and I hope that, since
the advocate remains, he will not leave
us dissatisfied with the fee which his
kindness has so well merited."</p>

<p>"I accept the proposition, monseigneur,"
replied Barati, with a smile. "I
know of no better weapons than those
which one receives from his enemy."</p>

<p>Giacomo did not reply, but he muttered
in a low tone:</p>

<p>"I was mistaken in this man."</p>

<p>Barati at once entered into a conversation
with the notary, in which he manifested
his perfect acquaintance with the
details of his profession. He guaranteed
Leonore's rights in a manner much more
ample and secure than had been done in
the contract; he placed her dowry beyond
the reach of her husband, and ensured
her future independence.</p>

<p>"You are very careful of my sister's
interests," said Giacomo, smiling.</p>

<!-- page 142 col 2 -->

<p>"I am securing an asylum," he replied
calmly, "to her whom I have resolved
to deprive of her nearest protector."</p>

<p>"It is war, then, without mercy."</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur. And now," he
added aloud, "you can sign the contract."</p>

<p>Leonore cast a bewildered glance upon
Barati, but he stood calm and motionless,
as if he did not observe her. The
contract was signed; Giacomo, who had
disappeared for a moment, returned with
a casket which he reached to Barati.</p>

<p>"Does this appear sufficient?" he said,
opening it.</p>

<p>"With this, and a firm will," he replied,
"one might shake the throne of
France. Adieu!"</p>

<p>"Adieu then?" said Giacomo.</p>

<p>"Adieu!" repeated Barati.</p>

<p>And he left the house.</p>

<p>To leave no obscurity in the explanation
of the occurrences which have previously
been recounted, we must add
that Leonore, although her heart was occupied
by no other passion, felt a kind of
antipathy for the Duke de Nevers. Notwithstanding
his rank, and the education
which he had received, yet a germ of
rudeness and grossness was implanted in
his soul, which all his efforts were unable
to conceal, and which rendered him
almost repulsive to Leonore. Still, urged
by her mother and her brother, she had
at last consented to the marriage, but she
had obtained, as a special favor, that the
ceremony should be deferred for some
months, and that she should remain with
her mother until the duke had obtained
the king's consent to this union, which
might compromise his standing at court,
but which, by a singular chance, served
only to augment it. Louis XIV. already
nourished the design of placing his family
upon the Spanish throne; as we have
before said, the house of Puzzano was
allied to the most noble families of Spain
and Italy, and the great king would
doubtless be well pleased to see among
the nobles who depended upon his favor, a
man who might exert a considerable influence
upon the success of his design.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE MIDNIGHT MEETING.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now continue our narrative
and return to Barati. After leaving
Mirepoix for Toulouse, two thoughts
alone occupied his soul. The first was
to avenge himself against Giacomo, the
second to bring about his marriage with
Armande. He looked upon the alliance
as a certain, or at least very probable
step to the office occupied by the
president, and, born of an obscure family,
he had set his hopes upon the accomplishment
of this project.</p>

<p>In the hazardous situation in which
Giacomo now found himself he ought
doubtless to have given up the appointment
which he had made with Mademoiselle
de Lostanges, but although he
might have spared Barati if he had
known of his intention to renew this
alliance, yet when he heard the menaces
of the young advocate, he resolved
to pursue his project.</p>

<p>The sole precaution which he took
was to obtain a promise from his mother
that she would remove all evidence
of his existence. As to the casket which
he had placed in Barati's hands on the
preceding evening, it might have been
exceedingly dangerous if it had been
discovered in the abode of the princess,
and in giving it to the young advocate, he
had transferred that danger to him. In
addition to this, Giacomo advised his
mother to display great liberality towards
the convents and the chapter of the city
which was henceforth to be her place
of residence. Giacomo had too often
tested the power of gold not to counsel
its employment as a universal remedy
for all annoyances in this life, and the
result of this narrative will show that he
judged rightly.</p>

<p>Giacomo remained but two days at
Mirepoix, where he held a long and secret
interview with the Comte de Frias,
the stranger who was present at the
scene which we have described. Frias
remained at Mirepoix, where he was to
meet the Baron de la Roque, and Giacomo
departed for Toulouse. He did
not doubt but Barati had taken serious
measures against him, and it was for

<!-- page 143 col 2 -->

this reason that our adventurer disguised
himself in a costume, which, more
than any other, was calculated to protect
him against the scrutiny of those who
might lie in wait for him. He put on
the dirty tattered robe of a Capuchin
monk; a false beard, blood-shot eyes,
and a nose glowing with the hue of the
grape, so effectually transformed him,
that when, to test the security of his disguise,
he presented himself to his mother,
remembering her son's counsel, she
offered him her purse.</p>

<p>It was in this dress that Giacomo
reached Toulouse, and entered the city
on the very evening of his appointment
with the beautiful Armande. The garb
of a Capuchin was without doubt admirably
suited for the peaceful traveller,
but it was detestable for the lover; he
directed his steps therefore to the dwelling
of Vergnes in order to change it.
Giacomo's astonishment was extreme, at
hearing in the chamber adjoining the one
in which he had entered, the voice of
Barati, who was conversing with the
innkeeper and interrogating him as to
the motives which led him to the president's
hotel on the day appointed for the
signing of the contract.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Barati's threats,
Vergnes refused to answer, and declared
he was there by accident. The young
advocate, on the contrary, maintained
that he had been sent by some one, to
watch him, and without naming the
Prince of Puzzano, he described him so
that Vergnes could not mistake the man
to whom he referred; but as the innkeeper
persisted in his denials, Barati
seeing that he could obtain nothing by
threats, began at last to speak of a reward.
A change in the tone of Vergnes'
voice, warned Giacomo of the
weakness, of him whose fidelity was so
necessary to him; he pushed open the
door, and thrusting his head and hands
through the aperture, said in a nasal
tone:</p>

<p>"Forget not the faithful servants of
God!"</p>

<p>"The devil take the Capuchin!" said
Vergnes.</p>

<p>"Begone!" cried Barati, "these beggars
are as impudent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My son," interrupted Giacomo,

<!-- page 144 col 1 -->

"hunger chases the wolf from the woods,
and it compels me to enter this house
notwithstanding its evil reputation."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Barati, "here is a
louis: it is enough I suppose, to give
you strength to go and beg elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Ha," said the Capuchin, gazing at
the louis, "your generosity does not cost
you much; this louis is a counterfeit."</p>

<p>"A counterfeit!" cried Barati, retaking
it, and examining it without being
able to discover any marks to convince
him that it was spurious.</p>

<p>"It is counterfeit, I say, and I know
it, for I have been unlucky to-day;
I have already received one like it from
a muleteer as he was leaving Toulouse,
and you may be sure I was surprised
at his liberality. I stopped at the mint
as I passed to change it, and, but for
the sanctity of my garb, and the reputation
which the brothers of our order
have acquired for their virtues and sobriety,
they would have arrested me."</p>

<p>Barati had received this louis with several
others in the casket which Giacomo
had placed in his hands at Mirepoix.
All this gold was counterfeit then,
and his pretended liberality was but a
new trick. On the other side this Capuchin
had just declared, that he had
received a similar louis from a muleteer;
this muleteer then must be the prince,
who had resumed his former disguise.
Barati inquired after his age, his features,
and Giacomo described himself
accurately as he had appeared at the advocate's
house on the evening of his arrival
in the city.</p>

<p>"And you say, reverend father,"
cried Barati, "that he has left Toulouse."</p>

<p>"Yes, forsooth, mounted upon a shabby
mule, and jogging on towards Montauban."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Barati, "I will
overtake him though I ride night and
day."</p>

<p>With these words he hastened from
the house, while Vergnes gazed with
dismay at the Capuchin, and cried:</p>

<p>"Accursed Capuchin! why have
you meddled in the matter? why
tell this young man the route of that
muleteer?"</p>

<p>"Ha! gently, gently!" replied Giacomo,

<!-- page 144 col 2 -->

laughing heartily, "do not assume
that air of indignation; if I had
not entered in time, you would, for a few
false louis, have told this Barati that the
muleteer who pays you in fair and loyal
crowns, would return one of these days
to resume the costume of a Spanish
Don which he left with you."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, it is you then?" cried
Vergnes gazing at him attentively and
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, knave, but stay! try to furnish
me with something fit to eat, and prepare
a chamber where I can dress myself
somewhat more becomingly."</p>

<p>Vergnes obeyed, and the neighboring
clock had scarcely struck eleven, when
Giacomo left the house clothed and
armed as he had been when he entered
the saloon of the President De Lostanges.</p>

<p>About half an hour before midnight he
stood at the garden gate; he pushed it;
it was unfastened; he entered, but he
saw no one. This circumstance alarmed
him. It might be a snare set for him,
for with the gate once closed behind
him, a few resolute men would suffice
to overpower him.</p>

<p>Armande, however, did not appear capable
of such a piece of treachery; still
he kept near the gate, ready to fly
at the least sign of danger. He stood
for some time without hearing a sound;
he waited until the clock struck twelve,
but all remained quiet. A quarter of
an hour passed and Giacomo began to
think that his alarm was unfounded:
he was about to advance farther into
the garden when he saw a female coming
towards him, but it was not Armande;
this woman cast a watchful glance
on all sides, and seeing no one, she turned
and spoke to some person who followed
her:</p>

<p>"I was very sure mamselle, that he
would not come, that he would not dare
to come. We can fasten the gate."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Rosine," replied Armande,
with a faltering voice. "Alas! he
risked his life to save me, and it would
be the basest ingratitude to disappoint
him. Perhaps he has some favor to ask
of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could I doubt," said Giacomo
to himself, "how could I doubt but

<!-- page 145 col 1 -->

she would be here! and how careful she
has been not to breathe my name! how
she conceals the interest which prompts
her under a semblance of gratitude for
the service which I have rendered her.
Oh, woman! Still she is very beautiful,
and I will love her, if she will let
me&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>These reflections were interrupted by
several voices which were heard at the
further extremity of the garden. They
called Armande, who ran towards them,
while Rosine advanced hastily to close
the gate.</p>

<p>"In truth, Armande, I do not understand
your conduct," said M. de Lostanges,
"what madness has seized you, that
you leave your chamber at this hour to
walk in the garden? Go in&mdash;it is time
to shut the doors; you know that robbers
infest this part of the city, and they
might scale the wall, steal into our
apartments, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>All this was said at intervals, and interrupted
by Armande's excuses, who
replied that she had a headache, and
that she had gone down into the garden
to breathe the fresh air. The sound of
their voices gradually grew less distinct;
Giacomo heard the doors closed,
and he remained alone in the garden.</p>

<p>Instead of being disappointed, our adventurer
was delighted at this interruption.</p>

<p>"Unless her apartment looks upon the
street," he said, "she will open the casement,
and we will see if she does not
descend again, when I let her know that
I am here."</p>

<p>He approached the house, and saw a
light brought into one of the chambers.
But was this Armande's? This must
be ascertained. Giacomo's patience in
waiting for the proper moment was equal
to the rapidity with which he acted when
it arrived. He remained for an hour
leaning against a tree in front of this
chamber; he stood motionless, his eyes
did not leave the casement. At the
expiration of this time the light was
extinguished, and Giacomo was beginning
to despair of the success of his
adventure, when the casement was
thrown open, and some one leaned out
over the balcony. Presently a voice
murmured softly:</p>

<!-- page 145 col 2 -->

<p>"Giacomo Spaffa!"</p>

<p>"He is here!" replied Giacomo.</p>

<p>Armande was unable to repress a cry.</p>

<p>"Rash man!" she said, "fly! fly!"</p>

<p>"Not until I have spoken with you."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! my father's chamber
looks upon the garden."</p>

<p>"Come down then, I implore you."</p>

<p>"It is impossible! the doors are locked,
and my father has the keys."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Giacomo, "I will
ascend to you."</p>

<p>He approached the window, but the
wall was entirely bare and destitute of
lattice work by means of which he might
scale it, and the shutters which closed
the window of the chamber beneath
Armande's, did not offer the least support
by which he could raise himself to
the upper story.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is madness!" said Armande
in a whisper, "do not attempt it. Some
harm will befall you."</p>

<p>"Lose all, or win all!" thought Giacomo
at this moment.</p>

<p>"I must speak to you or die!" he said.
"Throw me down a cord, a ribbon&mdash;any
thing that I may ascend to you."</p>

<p>"I cannot! never!" said Armande.</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken when they
heard a door thrown open at the farther
side of the house, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Seek him, Pluto, seek him!"</p>

<p>"You are lost!" said Armande, withdrawing.
"They have loosed the watch
dog."</p>

<p>And Giacomo heard the noise made by
an enormous dog following his track
through the alleys of the garden. He
drew his sword to defend himself, when,
the next moment, he beheld a sheet cast
from the window; he grasped it and with
the dexterity of a corsair, familiar with
the most difficult feats of agility, he
mounted to the window, entered the
chamber, and drew up the sheet. At
this moment the dog came bounding and
barking beneath the casement.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Armande.</p>

<p>"It is I, mamselle," replied the gardener.
"I thought I heard a noise in
the garden."</p>

<p>"I opened the window to breathe the
fresh air," she replied.</p>

<p>A noise was now heard in the house;
Giacomo withdrew into the alcove, and

<!-- page 146 col 1 -->

the venerable president appeared in his
night dress, with a lighted taper in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to prevent the whole
house from sleeping?" he said. "Come,
get to bed, and shut the window, and do
not render it necessary for me to return
to see if you have obeyed me."</p>

<p>Armande closed the casement.</p>

<p>"I shall be employed in writing the
whole night, and if I hear this window
opened again, you will repent of it."</p>

<p>He went out, and Armande and Giacomo
were left alone.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE WEDDING NIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> days had passed since the evening
when Giacomo had so boldly entered
the chamber of Armande. During this
while, notwithstanding the silence which
M. de Lostanges had requested of those
who had been present when the marriage
of Barati and Armande was so suddenly
interrupted, rumors of the occurrence
had spread abroad throughout Toulouse,
and a thousand improbable tales were
invented to account for it. This, however
was universally maintained, that
Mademoiselle de Lostanges had received
a deadly and unpardonable insult.</p>

<p>The president's indignation had at
first prompted him to take some serious
measures to avenge himself, above all,
when he believed that his daughter had
been abandoned for another woman; but
when he was satisfied that Barati had contracted
no new alliance; when he knew
that the bridegroom had left the house of
his father-in-law so abruptly, solely to witness
the contract of marriage between
the Duke de Nevers and Leonora of
Puzzano, his anger was changed to
astonishment.</p>

<p>What duty, what obligation, what
oath indeed could have induced him to
act thus, could have led him to interrupt
a marriage which he had so ardently
desired! And for what? Apparently
for nothing. It was an inexplicable
enigma, which Barati's previous conduct
could scarcely explain; his relations to

<!-- page 146 col 2 -->

the princess of Puzzano were a subject
of general comment, and each asked the
other what powerful tie could so bind
him to this family, that the slightest word
was sufficient to summon him from a ceremony
of such interest. This supposed
obligation, combined with the singular
manner in which this summons had been
brought to Barati, seemed to indicate
some criminal plot between him and the
princess of Puzzano, and it was resolved
that the advocate should be summoned
before one of the chambers of parliament.
When he appeared before the chamber
which was to interrogate him, Barati
assumed an air of modest diffidence, and
said:</p>

<p>"I am prepared to obey the orders of
the parliament, and to render an account
of my proceedings, but I will venture to
ask a favor which can have no influence
upon the result of this inquiry. To
explain my conduct it is necessary that I
should reveal a secret which concerns
the honor of a noble family; I have taken
an oath to reveal this secret to the first
president of the parliament alone, in case
I should be interrogated, and I am not authorized
to disclose it in full session,
unless the first president is dissatisfied
with the propriety of my course. I venture,
therefore, to hope from the indulgence
of the chamber that it will permit
me to observe a sacred oath, for if
the first president refuses to answer for
the uprightness of my conduct, it will
then be in your power to demand a
stricter investigation."</p>

<p>This method of procedure sadly disappointed
the curiosity of the councillors,
but the strict integrity of the first president
left no room for cavil, and it would
have been an insult to decide that he was
unworthy of being the sole judge of the
validity of Barati's explanation.</p>

<p>Our young advocate had taken his
measures shrewdly; and he was sufficiently
sure of the first president's discretion
to know that if he could but convince
him of the truth of what he told
him, the secret which he was about to
entrust to him would never pass his lips,
and consequently that no one could test
its accuracy.</p>

<p>Barati's request was granted, although
his words had excited even greater

<!-- page 147 col 1 -->

curiosity than his conduct; he at once
retired with the first president, who led
him into his private cabinet. The following
was the fable which Barati narrated
to him:</p>

<p>"One night," he said, "as I passed
the hotel of the Princess of Puzzano, I
heard loud cries in the interior of the
building, and I stopped to learn the
cause. I heard the sounds of a violent
conflict, and I was about to knock at the
door, when I saw a man leap from the
window of the hotel. I at first thought
that it was a robber, and that having
been frustrated in his attempt, he had
wounded some female of the house, for I
had recognised the voice of a woman
begging for mercy. I rushed upon this
man to seize him, but, being unarmed, I
was assailed and beaten to the ground
before I observed that my antagonist
was the Duke de Nevers.</p>

<p>"I recognised him at the moment that
he drew his sword to thrust me through,
when he was disarmed, in his turn, by a
man who attacked him unawares. I
rose, and the duke took to flight. I was
about to thank my liberator, when he
asked me why I had been thus assaulted.
I related to him what I had seen and
heard, and did not conceal that this man
was the Duke de Nevers.</p>

<p>" 'The Duke de Nevers!' he cried, in
a gloomy tone, 'oh! I might have known
it.' Then he added: 'I have just saved
your life, and I have the right to
demand a recompense.' "</p>

<p>"I offered him money; he refused it,
and said:</p>

<p>" 'You do not understand me; promise
me only that, at whatever hour of the
day or night I come to seek you, in whatever
manner I warn you to follow me,
you will obey me on the instant.'</p>

<p>"I promised, and the man required me
to take an oath upon a sacred relic that
he wore about him.</p>

<p>"This was the person who came to seek
me at the house of M. de Lostanges, and
the moment that he spoke to me of a
marriage, I understood his meaning. I
had sworn to follow him, and I did so,
and in truth when I arrived at Mirepoix,
I found the Duke de Nevers at the house
of the Princess of Puzzano. The unknown
led me in company with her and

<!-- page 147 col 2 -->

the Duke de Nevers, into a separate
chamber.</p>

<p>" 'Here is a witness of the outrage
which you inflicted upon my sister,'
said the unknown, who then declared
himself to be the Prince of Puzzano;
'you would fain deny it, but he is here
to attest it.'</p>

<p>" 'I know him,' said the duke, 'and I
confess my fault.'</p>

<p>" 'Well then,' rejoined the prince,
'he is to be a witness of the reparation
which you will make to Leonora, by espousing
her; or he is to be a witness of
my vengeance.'</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding his audacity, the
duke consented to the terms which had
been offered to him, and I was present at
the signing of the contract. These are
the facts in all their naked simplicity,"
said Barati; "I have requested permission
to reveal them to you, in order to
justify my conduct; the prince has authorised
me to do so, though under the
restrictions which I have mentioned, if
they are found admissible. I acted as I
thought it my duty to act, for whatever
are the crimes of her brother, Mademoiselle
Leonore of Puzzano is worthy of all
respect, and again whatever opinion may
be passed upon the prince, I ought not to
forget that I owe my life to him."</p>

<p>"I knew," rejoined the first president,
"that you were present at this
marriage, and I could not comprehend
what interest could summon you thither
at such a moment. I understand it now,
and far from blaming your conduct, I
approve of it, and I will be warrant for
you in face of the whole parliament.
Are you content with this?"</p>

<p>"With your kindness, I am, sir, more
than I can express," replied Barati, "but
this affair has not the less cost me my
happiness. I venture, therefore, to request
a favor of you, my lord."</p>

<p>"What favor?"</p>

<p>"It is true I am not so mad as to hope
that M. de Lostanges will pardon me for
the insult, unintentional as it was, which
I have been guilty of towards him; yet
if I could hope that you would have the
kindness to say to him, that it has never
entered into my thoughts to fail in respect
towards him, that I venerate and

<!-- page 148 col 1 -->

honor him as I ought, this would console
me for the loss of an alliance so greatly
above my deserts, an alliance so dear to
me, that it required all the sanctity of an
oath pronounced upon a sacred relic, to
compel me unwillingly to disturb it."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Barati shed a few tears,
and the first president, charmed with his
modesty and grief, replied graciously:</p>

<p>"Console yourself, Master Barati, console
yourself; M. de Lostanges has
some esteem and friendship for me, and
I will, if possible, arrange the affair."</p>

<p>Barati having thus repaired the evil
which Giacomo had caused him, pondered
now upon the means of retaliation.
We will not relate the various useless
attempts which he made to discover the
prince; he suspected indeed that Vergnes
could give him important information,
but he found this man inaccessible
to his bribes; besides this, the young
advocate no longer dared to frequent his
house; for, thanks to the intervention
of the first president, he had resumed
the hope of espousing Mademoiselle de
Lostanges, and it was of importance that
no suspicion should be aroused as to the
correctness of his deportment. We also
will be silent concerning the respective
position of Armande and Giacomo, for
that which we are about to recount, will
sufficiently explain it.</p>

<p>Two months had passed since the
scene of the marriage contract, the same
preparations for a similar event had been
made in the hotel of the President de
Lostanges; the same persons were present,
and in addition, the first president
of the parliament, and as at that time
Barati repaired thither in the morning.</p>

<p>Armande, more terrified, more pallid
than on the former occasion, was seated
near her mother, when the advocate entered.
At this moment M. de Lostanges
arose, and said:</p>

<p>"I have invited you all, my friends,
to witness the completion of that ceremony,
which two months ago was interrupted
by the sudden departure of M.
Barati. He could not have entered my
house again, except to make this reparation.
And this reparation I would not
have accepted, had not the first president
assured me that the conduct of M. Barati
was prompted by no motive which

<!-- page 148 col 2 -->

could be offensive or insulting to me, or
to my family. Neither would this have
sufficed, for not the slightest stigma must
rest upon the man who is destined to be
the guardian of my daughter's happiness,
but the first president has declared, and
will declare it to you also, that M. Barati
was compelled to leave my house by an
imperious appeal of honor, having been
summoned to perform an action which deserves
praise instead of blame, and which
saved from ruin a young and innocent
maiden. It is for these reasons, gentlemen,
that I have consented to conclude
this union; it is for this purpose that I
have requested your presence."</p>

<p>All present testified their approbation,
and overwhelmed Barati with compliments.
As to Armande, she seemed to
have heard but a single sentence of her
father's address&mdash;that Barati had risked
his own happiness to save a young and
innocent maiden, and she murmured,
while the tears came into her eyes:</p>

<p>"Oh! every where deceit and falsehood!"</p>

<p>Still, however, it seemed as if she expected
some new interposition, but the
hour passed by, the contract was read,
was signed, and the pen was placed in
her hand. With a bewildered air she
approached the table near which Barati
was standing; she started back at first,
but the latter said to her mildly:</p>

<p>"Sign it, mademoiselle; I know how
to pardon disappointed hopes."</p>

<p>What was the meaning of these
words? was he aware of the liaison of
Armande and Giacomo, or did he allude
to her present state of suspense, which
was so plainly stamped upon her features.
Armande could not understand
it, but impelled by a feeling of despair,
she signed the contract, then rose, as if
startled at what she had done, tottered
forward, and fell in a swoon upon the floor.</p>

<p>The insult which she had received
from Barati, and which she had not pardoned,
perhaps, as her father had done,
seemed to be a sufficient explanation of
the anxiety which she had manifested,
of the reluctance with which she consented
to this union, and of the swoon
which followed the act which rendered
it irrevocable. M. de Lostanges seemed
to look upon it in this light, for turning

<!-- page 149 col 1 -->

to Barati, who stood gazing gloomily
upon Armande, he said:</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, the wife will
readily pardon in the husband, the
wrongs of the bridegroom towards the
bride."</p>

<p>Two hours after this, the marriage
ceremony was performed in the chapel
of the Capitol, and Armande returned
home with a calmness which seemed to
have originated in some settled resolution.
The remainder of the day passed
in quiet, and the bride appeared entirely
to have forgotten the grief which had
oppressed her in the morning.</p>

<p>When evening came she was led to
the nuptial chamber, whither Barati soon
followed her. He found Armande still
up, her features agitated, and she seemed
with difficulty to control some powerful
emotion.</p>

<p>Barati paused upon the threshold, and
Armande said:</p>

<p>"Enter sir, for it is certainly the first,
and perhaps the last time that you will
cross the threshold of this chamber."</p>

<p>Barati rushed toward her and gazed
upon her with an affrighted air, for he
imagined that her despair had prompted
her to make some attempt upon her life.</p>

<p>"<i>Grand Dieu!</i>" he exclaimed, in a
faltering voice, "what have you done,
and what means this paleness?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, sir," said Armande,
"there is a fearful account to be settled
between us."</p>

<p>Barati still gazed upon her; she directed
him by a sign to take a seat, and
sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"I have deceived you, sir," said Armande,
"yet I do not for that reason
think myself unworthy of you, for you
have obtained my hand by falsehood."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"It was not to save a young maiden
from a dishonor that you followed the
man who came to seek you."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed Barati.</p>

<p>"It was in the hope of connecting
yourself with a family whose wealth
could, more effectually than mine, assuage
your burning thirst for gold."</p>

<p>"Madam," exclaimed Barati, "who
has whispered such slanders in your ear?"</p>

<p>"He who knows as well as you do
that they are truths,"</p>

<!-- page 149 col 2 -->

<p>She paused, and Barati gazing sharply
upon her, slowly repeated the words:
"He who knows as well as I that they
are truths?"</p>

<p>"The prince of Puzzano," said Armande.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Armande, "I know him."</p>

<p>"Since when?" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"Since the night when you compelled
the duke to silence&mdash;he was near me
when you threatened him with the disclosure
of a letter, the publication of
which would ruin him."</p>

<p>"And since then?" said Barati, with
his eye fixed upon Armande.</p>

<p>"Since then," she rejoined, hesitating,
"since then&mdash;"</p>

<p>While she was striving to subdue the
emotion which agitated her, a slight
noise was heard below the window.&mdash;She
started, and glancing towards it,
said, in a faint voice:</p>

<p>"He is there! he comes too late to
save me, but he has come in time to tell
you, that between you and me there can
exist nothing in common but the name."</p>

<p>She at once threw up the window, and
Barati heard some one ascend the wall.
Confused and agitated, scarcely conscious
of what he was doing, he retired
into a corner of the apartment, and in a
moment Giacomo leaped in at the window.</p>

<p>"I received your billet this morning,"
he said, "when I was twenty leagues
from here, and I hastened hither with
all speed; it is not too late, I hope."</p>

<p>"Look!" said Armande, pointing to
Barati.</p>

<p>"What! this marriage is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is concluded," said Barati, advancing.</p>

<p>"And you have consented, Armande?"
cried Giacomo.</p>

<p>"It is now eight days that I have
been waiting for you," she said, trembling
and bewildered, "and when I
thought that you had forsaken me, what
could I do but hide my dishonor beneath
the name of a man, who is so skilful in
the art of acquiring that respect which
he deserves no more than I do."</p>

<p>A thrill of fury darted through Barati's
frame. He cast a wild glance around
the chamber, as if searching for a weapon;

<!-- page 150 col 1 -->

but Giacomo hurling him to the
floor with his powerful arm, and placing
his poignard to his throat, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Listen, Barati, if you value your
life, you must respect this woman.&mdash;Not
a word that can injure her&mdash;do
you hear? She doubted my fidelity,
she had not the firmness to resist this
union, and she will suffer the penalty
for life; but forget not this, Barati&mdash;I
know you, I can read the very depths
of your sordid and ambitious soul; at
my will I can dishonor you or slay you&mdash;I
permit you to live, honored, respected.
But Armande shall remain without
blemish in the eyes of the world..
Do you consent?"</p>

<p>"Do you love this woman?" said Barati,
with a strange accent of calmness
and resignation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I loved her, and so well, that I
would have made her my wife, had I
had a name to bestow upon her."</p>

<p>A savage smile played about Barati's
lips, and he replied:</p>

<p>"Well then, I consent, though without
prejudice to the vengeance which I have
sworn to visit upon you."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Giacomo.</p>

<p>"And now, remain if you will, for,
as she has said, this is the first and last
time that I cross the threshold of this
chamber."</p>

<p>"No one shall cross it more," said
Armande, "neither you nor he."</p>

<p>Barati left the apartment, and Giacomo
disappeared almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>"My life is dedicated to misfortune
now!" cried Armande, falling upon her
knees. "Oh, God! give me the strength
to bear it!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p class="small">DOMESTIC MISERY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the scene which we have related
in the preceding chapter, after the
words of Barati, "this is the first and
last time that I cross the threshold of
this chamber," the reader will readily
understand that some secret motive had
silenced his resentment, and that he expected
his vengeance from some future

<!-- page 150 col 2 -->

event. It is necessary also to inform
him that in the meanwhile Armande's
mother had died, and she had left her
father's house to occupy that of her husband.</p>

<p>The world in general is very ready
to pity those misfortunes which are the
result of some thrilling accident, some
evident catastrophe; but it refuses to
put faith in the sorrows which are concealed
beneath the outward show of an
even mode of life, and if it suspects
some griefs, from the anxious features
of the victims, it prefers to attribute
them to singularity and caprice of character
rather than to a real and sufficient
cause.</p>

<p>In truth, to look upon Barati and his
wife, the one young, full of activity, devoted
to his studies, and already rewarded
by considerable success; the other,
young also, beautiful, enjoying perfect
liberty, treated with respect by her husband,
mistress of a fortune above her
rank; to look upon them thus, it would
be difficult to imagine that they were
not happy. But from what we have
already related, the reader will easily
comprehend that a more miserable condition
could scarcely be found than that
of these two beings, chained thus for
life together.</p>

<p>It was in vain that they arranged their
domestic routine so as to meet as seldom
as possible; at table, in the world, they
were forced to endure each other's presence,
and at the same time to wear upon
their brows the calmness and serenity
which never visited their hearts. After
a while, an event occurred which augmented
the tortures of their life. Barati,
who had sought relief in excessive labor
from the thought which gnawed incessantly
upon his bosom, fell dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the duties
of a wife are plain and imperious; to
watch day and night at her husband's
pillow, to entrust to no other hands those
cares which are required by his position,
this is the duty of every wife, and this duty
Armande imposed upon herself. But
what was there to cheer her in this task?
Love? No! Hope? She had lost all
hope! And could her husband believe
in the sincerity of these attentions? did

<!-- page 151 col 1 -->

he not know that they were a farce, a
show, to blind the eyes of the world? his
condition was more wretched than the
poorest beggar, for the beggar, perhaps,
has a wife, a sister, a mother, to tend him
in sincerity, and to cheer him with love.</p>

<p>Often during this malady were those
undesigned cruelties committed on either
part, which crush and degrade those
who are guilty of them, and those who
suffer them. More than once when Armande
offered Barati a medicine or a
draught prescribed by the physician, he
stopped, when upon the point of taking
it, and gazing at his wife with a haggard,
timid glance, he said to her in an affrighted
and yet impetuous tone:</p>

<p>"Taste it, taste! drink it before me.
You would esteem yourself happy to be
rid of me!"</p>

<p>Armande, surmounting her disgust for
those nauseous draughts, obeyed, placed
the cup to her lips, and drank. Barati
would then gaze upon her with savage
joy, and say:</p>

<p>"It is well! we shall die together, if
it is poison."</p>

<p>On one occasion, driven beyond the
limits of that resignation which she had
imposed upon herself, Armande replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, would to heaven that it were
poison! I have no fear of death!"</p>

<p>These words, wrung from her by grief
and indignation, suggested to Barati the
thought that she would not recoil from
the sacrifice of her own life, in order to
avenge herself upon her husband. A
cruel and gloomy scene then passed at
the bedside of the sick man. Barati
would not receive a remedy from the
hands of his wife, until she had taken
the most solemn oaths that she would
not attempt his life; he compelled her
to devote her soul to eternal perdition
if she deceived him; then, when he had
tortured her with all his fears, he would
add:</p>

<p>"Drink! drink first!"</p>

<p>With persons of a less resolute character
than those of Barati and Armande,
one or the other would have put an end
to this mutual torture by refusing to grant
these cares, or by refusing to accept
them; but both had devoted all the power
of their souls, to conceal beneath a
false semblance of harmony and reciprocal

<!-- page 151 col 2 -->

affection, the chasm which existed
between them, and they sustained this
struggle until Barati's returning health
came to relieve them from it.</p>

<p>Armande's constancy, perhaps, might
have moved Barati; perhaps, in presence
of this devotion, so patient, so resigned,
the heart of the young advocate might
have been softened: and often during his
convalescence, he had said to himself
that it would be a happiness for him,
perhaps, should he generously pardon
the past, when an event occurred which
restored all the energy of his purpose,
all the cruelty of his vengeance.</p>

<p>One evening, Barati, already sufficiently
recovered to receive the visits of
a few friends, had felt impelled toward
this project of forgiveness by the sincere
eulogiums which had been showered
upon Armande's conduct during
his illness. The young wife, admirably
performing the fearful part which she
played, had had the courage to listen to
them without grief, without bitterness;
she had demeaned herself like a woman
who loves, and is loved in return; her
conduct had been simple and natural;
all were retiring, when the wife of one
of his colleagues, as she left the saloon,
approached Barati, and said in a confidential
tone:</p>

<p>"And now, oblige her to be more careful
of herself; I am much mistaken, or
Armande is in a condition which renders
such exertions dangerous."</p>

<p>She who uttered these words did not
remark the terrible effect which they
produced upon Barati; Armande had
not heard them. She was left alone,
then, with her husband, and as she usually
retired as soon as the fearful task
which she had to perform was ended, she
rose to leave the chamber. Barati, still
feeble, pale from his illness, still paler
from emotion, rose also, and closing the
door of the apartment, he arrested Armande's
steps, and said in a tone of
fury:</p>

<p>"Is it true?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Armande, recoiling at
the threatening glance of her husband.</p>

<p>He gazed long upon her; the words
seemed unable to leave his lips; language
seemed wanting to his anger. At
last he approached her, and grasping her

<!-- page 152 col 1 -->

by the arm, he replied in a low but exasperated
tone:</p>

<p>"Must I give my name then, to the
offspring of your guilt?"</p>

<p>Armande turned pale and trembled.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"It is true!" responded Armande,
falling upon her knees.</p>

<p>"And it was for this, then, that you
durst not kill me, durst not destroy yourself
with me?"</p>

<p>This dreadful accusation restored the
strength of which her husband's words
had previously deprived her; rising to
her feet, and offering her bosom, she
cried:</p>

<p>"Strike then, sir, strike! for if it is
destined to be as wretched as I am, better
that it should die before it sees the
light, better that I should die before I
see it suffer."</p>

<p>Whether from pity, whether from the
thought of a still more cruel vengeance,
or whether that he recoiled at such a
crime, Barati stood motionless; he was
long silent; then after having taken time
to form his purpose, he said:</p>

<p>"Begone, madam, begone! to-morrow
you shall hear my resolution."</p>

<p>On the following morning, Madame
Barati learned to her extreme surprise,
that M. de Lostanges had been summoned
by a letter from his son-in-law, in
which the latter had communicated to
him in terms of the highest delight, the
hope which he entertained of an heir;
this news was at once spread abroad, and
the day had not ended before she received
the congratulations of her friends
and family. These congratulations,
which are invariably accompanied by
slight railleries, were the commencement
of a new torture for Armande. What
was Barati's object? at what was he
aiming? what did he intend to do? Armande
would fain have questioned him,
but she had not the courage.</p>

<p>About six months had elapsed from the
day of their marriage; Barati took his
wife to a country house at a little distance
from the city. Armande accompanied
him without opposition; she feared
the commission of a crime, but resistance
was impossible, and she resigned
herself to her fate.</p>

<p>It was in this house, that, entrusted to

<!-- page 152 col 2 -->

the cares of Rosine, who had been the
confidante of her love for Giacomo, she
gave birth to a son, and it was while this
son was still in her arms, that the following
scene took place. Barati entered
the chamber, and in the presence of Rosine,
said to Armande:</p>

<p>"Now, madam, it is time that you
should know my will, and my steadfast
purpose. I will not give my name to an
infant which is not mine; neither will I
punish it more severely than the world
would punish it for the fault of its mother,
were I to speak the truth. It would
be the child of shame if I should speak;
it shall remain so still, but it shall never
be able to cast a stigma upon you."</p>

<p>"What mean you, sir?" said Armande.</p>

<p>"You shall never see this child again,
madam. The time and circumstances
of its birth will explain and lend sufficient
probability to the story of an accident,
and no one will suspect either your
dishonor or mine."</p>

<p>Armande listened anxiously, occupied
by a single thought.</p>

<p>"Would you destroy it?" she cried,
"would you destroy it?"</p>

<p>"This child," said Barati, "shall be
placed in the hands of this woman, your
accomplice, and she will entrust it to the
care of a man who will rear it."</p>

<p>Armande cast a bewildered glance
upon Rosine, who by a sign seemed to
assure her that she would be faithful to
the trust.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, you will not kill it? you will
not burthen your conscience with such
a crime? You are an honest man, sir!"</p>

<p>Barati's sole reply was a disdainful
laugh, and Armande continued, but in a
very different tone:</p>

<p>"I should be base indeed if the fear
of shame could make me hesitate; you
shall not take away this child, you shall
not tear it from my arms; let my fault
be known, but you shall not destroy it."</p>

<p>Barati was astonished at this resolution,
and he replied in a tone less imperious
and less bitter:</p>

<p>"I have told you that it shall live, but
I have told you upon what conditions,
and you ought to be aware that if I had
resolved upon a crime, I would not have
suffered this woman to be present at this

<!-- page 153 col 1 -->

interview. Your child shall live, I say,
but it shall live separated from you."</p>

<p>"And shall I never see it again?" said
Armande.</p>

<p>Barati hesitated: he was aware that
the success of his design depended upon
the hopes which he left to Armande, and
he replied:</p>

<p>"The future may lead to serious
changes in our respective situations, and
perhaps in our feelings; I swear that this
child shall live, but forget not the torments
which we have both suffered to
conceal our position from the eyes of the
world; and if the day shall ever come
when you are permitted to see it, I hope
that your affection for it will never lead
you to forget that prudence which is so
necessary, in order that no one may suspect
the motive of your attachment."</p>

<p>These words offered to Armande a
fairer prospect for the future than she had
dreamed of, and with her eyes filled with
tears, and a heart oppressed at the same
time by shame, by grief, and almost by
gratitude, she said:</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, conceal it from every
eye, and I swear in the face of heaven
that whatever you may henceforth require
of me, I will do it in return for
this generous indulgence."</p>

<p>Rosine took the child, and carried it
from the house; it was wrapped in swaddling
clothes which could afford no clue
to its origin, and following the directions
which had been given her, she carried it
to that house into which we have already
more than once introduced the reader.</p>

<p>This house was that of the inn-keeper
Vergnes. She reached it in the middle
of the night, and knocked at the door in
a peculiar manner, as she had been directed
to do.</p>

<p>But before recounting the scene which
passed in this house, it is necessary to
disclose the motives which had induced
Barati to select the dwelling of this
Vergnes. He was convinced that Giacomo
still kept up his relations with this
man, and he felt confident that when
once assured that a child had been placed
in his keeping, he would probably divine
its origin; he judged also, that if Giacomo's
suspicions were once excited on
this subject, he would be anxious to discover
the truths and might thus venture

<!-- page 153 col 2 -->

upon those steps that would enable Barati
to seize this enemy who had escaped
him, and who still foiled his pursuit.</p>

<p>Neither was it without an object that
he selected Rosine for this strange errand;
he had purchased her silence by
liberal gifts, yet it was probable that
Vergnes would recognise her as a domestic
of Madame Barati's, a fact which
would doubtless tend to attract Giacomo's
attention toward the child. Vergnes, on
the other hand, had been informed that
a secret service would be required of
him, that this service would be rewarded
beyond his expectations, and that he
would know the moment had arrived,
when he heard a peculiar knocking at
his door, which was described to him.</p>

<p>When Rosine, therefore, knocked in
this manner, Vergnes said to a man who
was with him:</p>

<p>"Some one is about to enter who has
a secret to confide to me. You know
that I spoke to you of the billet which
I received. Withdraw then, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"I know this secret," replied Giacomo,
"I alone ought to know it."</p>

<p>"But, monseigneur&mdash;" said Vergnes.</p>

<p>"Forget not that you are in my power,
and that I have rewarded you for every
service which you have rendered me, at
a price which would have enriched ten
men of your condition. Besides, you
shall have the promised reward, and I
will double it. Let me receive the person
who is about to enter."</p>

<p>Vergnes obeyed, and the prince, before
giving admission to Rosine, locked
the inn-keeper in a distant apartment.&mdash;He
then opened the door, and Rosine
entered.</p>

<p>"You have received information," she
said, "that you would be called upon to
render a service to a lady of high rank,"</p>

<p>Giacomo, with his eyes fastened upon
the little osier cradle, in which the infant
lay, did not answer, but exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is it a son, Rosine? is it a son?"</p>

<p>"You!" cried Rosine, who now recognised
Giacomo, although she was ignorant
of his name and rank.</p>

<p>"Yes, I! I was waiting for you."</p>

<p>"And how could you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I not know Armande's condition,
and the time&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 154 col 1 -->

<p>"But who could have told you that I
would come here?"</p>

<p>"I learned it from the billet that master
Barati sent to Vergnes; I recognised
the writing, notwithstanding the care
with which it was disguised. Give me
this child, and say to its mother, that I
will place it as securely as she could
wish, beyond the reach of her husband's
vengeance."</p>

<p>Rosine obeyed. Giacomo took the
infant, then, after having kissed it, and
gazed upon it for awhile, he said in a
tone of more emotion than would have
been expected from the sternness of his
character:</p>

<p>"And she consented to abandon it?"</p>

<p>Rosine then related the scene which
had passed at the country house.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Giacomo, "she hopes to
see it again. This depends no longer
upon Barati, it depends now upon me.
For the rest," he added, taking up a pen,
and writing a few lines, "give this to
your master, and tell your mistress that
she need no longer fear."</p>

<p>With these words he gave her a billet
which ran as follows:</p>

<p>"I have received from the hands of
your servant, the infant which you have
abandoned to misery and neglect. It is
beyond the reach of your hatred and under
the protection of its father. 20th
November, 1683."</p>

<p>It was this fatal date which had been
recalled to Barati in the castle of La
Roque, and at which he trembled and
turned pale.</p>

<p>And now, when we have briefly narrated
the precautions which Giacomo
had taken to ensure the safety of his son,
we will give an explanation also, of the
word <i>Uri</i>, which had terrified Barati no
less than that terrible date.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p class="small">HOPES OF RECONCILIATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> narrative already contains far
too many incidents to permit us to enter
into a detailed account of the precautions
which were taken by Giacomo to secure
the safety of his son. We will merely say

<!-- page 154 col 2 -->

that he sought out and found that Fran&ccedil;ois
Gali, whom he had met upon the road between
Mirepoix and Toulouse, in the character
of a blind beggar. His first step was
to unite him in marriage with a maiden
who had been brought up in the family
of the princess his mother. He then
established him as a fuller in the mountain;
he was the same Gali of whom we
have spoken in the commencement of this
narrative, and the unknown son of Giacomo
was that Galidou who bore the
name of his supposed father, with the
additional syllable, which, in the south
of France, generally distinguishes the
son from the father.</p>

<p>Besides this, in order to have in his
power those individuals who shared in
his secrets, he directed Vergnes to ask
for the hand of Rosine, who seemed to
him a very suitable wife for the innkeeper,
as a reward for the adroitness
and complaisance which she had displayed
in concealing his <i>liaison</i> with Armande.
Vergnes had but little difficulty
in obtaining Rosine's consent, and we
have since beheld her as the confidante
of the intrigue between the Duchess de
Nevers and the Chevalier D'Auterive.</p>

<p>These two points explained, we have
a new mystery to reveal to our readers.</p>

<p>After the disappearance of Giacomo's
son, Barati and Armande returned to the
city, and their mode of life was arranged
upon a new plan. The advocate seemed
to have entirely forgotten the past, and
although his manner was constantly constrained
towards his wife, yet he treated
her far more kindly than heretofore. Instead
of marching directly to his aim,
which was that of complete reconciliation,
he pursued a circuitous route, and
one, which, while he seemed to avoid
every concession, would be attended as
he thought with entire success.</p>

<p>Accordingly when they met, instead
of retiring as he had hitherto been accustomed
to do, Barati would commence a
conversation which had no relation to
their respective positions, and one which
Armande could scarcely refuse to engage
in. Thus, one day, after a discussion
with his father-in-law upon a subject
then under the consideration of parliament,
and upon which their sentiments
were not in accordance, M. de Lostanges

<!-- page 155 col 1 -->

having taken his leave, Barati after a
momentary silence, during which he
seemed absorbed in reflection, turned
suddenly to Armande, and said:</p>

<P>"Well, madam, you have here witnessed
one of the most vexatious results
of our profession. I refer to the discussion
which has just taken place between
M. de Lostanges and myself."</P>

<p>"There has been nothing unpleasant
in it, as it seemed to me."</p>

<p>"True," rejoined Barati, "but M. de
Lostanges has sought honestly to obtain a
just and correct view of this affair; I
have done the same; your father is certainly
one of our most enlightened magistrates,
I have studied the laws with
zeal and understand them passably well,
and still we are of a decidedly different
opinion."</p>

<p>"That happens often with the clearest
minds," said Armande.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, but do you know to
what this is owing! To these very studies
of which we are so proud. It must
be confessed that, in spite of ourselves,
the habit of deciding upon subjects, only
according to the written law, leads us to
base our conclusions upon authorities;
now, as oftentimes, there are twenty contradictory
authorities upon the same
subject, the mind becomes bewildered
and fatigued by collating and comparing
them, and thus it loses somewhat of that
natural clearness, which distinguishes at
a glance and without reasoning,&mdash;that
which is just from that which is unjust.
An ignorant man, I mean one unacquainted
with the law, unembarrassed
by its subtle distinctions, would have
touched the exact point of this discussion,
perhaps, in which we seem both at a loss.
Come, you have listened to this argument;
what is your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I, sir?" said Armande, with an air
of astonishment.</p>

<p>Barati did not wish to remark her surprise,
and assuming the appearance of
one deeply absorbed in the subject in
question, he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Women possess a firm
and decided judgment, that arrives at the
truth by the most direct road. I am
shaken by your father's arguments on
the one side, and on the other I am convinced
by my own. I may be deceived,

<!-- page 155 col 2 -->

I may be wrong, what is your opinion?"</p>

<p>Barati so well assumed the air of a
man who spoke merely of business, and
who would have spoken as he did to any
one who happened to be present, that
Armande replied in the same tone:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since you ask my opinion,
I think that my father is right in equity."</p>

<p>"Is that your opinion?" said Barati,
who had brought about the discussion
only to give rise to this incident.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, rising, "I will
plead the case according to this view;
equity should supersede all written authorities."</p>

<p>With these words he left the apartment.
Some days after, M. de Lostanges
said to his daughter with an air of
triumph:</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! your husband fell in with
my opinion, and we had perfect success."</p>

<p>And on returning home, Barati said to
his wife:</p>

<p>"You were right, madam; we have
gained our cause, and I owe this success
to you."</p>

<p>This example will show the steps
which Barati took to remove by degrees
the barrier which separated him from
Armande. Their conversation, it was
true, referred to subjects which had no
particular interest for them, but it was a
great point gained to break up in any
respect that isolated condition in which
they had stood toward each other. This
method of procedure was so skilfully
managed by Barati that his wife did not
remark it; she gradually became accustomed
to see those hours occupied,
which she had hitherto passed in sad and
cruel reflections, and on some occasions
she resumed all the gaiety and frankness
of her youth.</p>

<p>But a source of dissention lay hid
beneath this smooth surface. What had
become of Armande's child? The
greater the kindness with which Barati
treated his wife, the less courage did
she feel to approach this dreadful subject.
She would have done so twenty
times ere now if they had remained in a
state of hostility and permanent separation.
A reproach, a quarrel, an air of
coldness even, would have given occasion
to an inquiry or a complaint&mdash;but

<!-- page 156 col 1 -->

how to break this silence by recalling
a subject which would so keenly wound
Barati? Armande deferred her purpose
until to-morrow, and when to-morrow
came she had not the courage to commence
a discussion which would open
all their wounds afresh.</p>

<p>Her reluctance increased with time;
each day of delay rendered the subject
more difficult of approach, and six
months having thus elapsed, Armande
resolved not to apply to her husband, but
to make secret inquiries. She was
watched too closely, however, to be able
to conceal them from Barati; he knew
that Armande had asked after the dwelling
of Rosine, and that she intended to
visit her. He was aware of her object
in so doing, but the presence of his wife
in Vergnes' house could only be injurious
to her reputation. Under these
circumstances he tried a decisive stroke;
on the morning of the day when Armande
intended to pay this visit, a billet
from her husband was placed in her
hands. It ran as follows:</p>

<p>"I know whither you purpose to repair.
This step convinces me of the
thoughtless purity of your heart, for I
am sure that if you were aware that Rosine
was the mistress of a house of ill
repute, you would not venture to cross
the threshold. But you wish to see her,
and you shall. This woman will come
to-night, when she cannot be recognised.
Be in readiness to receive her,
and direct your domestics to admit her
as an unfortunate creature in whom you
are interested, and who is unwilling to
be known. This is the counsel of a
prudent friend rather than the command
of a husband."</p>

<p>This conduct surprised and touched
Armande; a thought of disobedience, so
common to suffering hearts, did not enter
her mind, and she awaited the evening,
but dreading the next interview with her
husband.</p>

<p>Barati understood the art of doing well
that which he had resolved to do, and
with a delicacy which affected Armande
still more deeply, he, wrote to her from
the house of one of his colleagues, informing
her that he was detained by important
business, and that he should not
return home until very late. Armande

<!-- page 156 col 2 -->

felt released from a cruel anxiety, and
for the first time perhaps, she reflected
seriously upon the change in her husband's
conduct.</p>

<p>Rosine was admitted in the evening,
but she had nothing to relate except the
scene which had passed in the house oi
Vergnes. As to what had become of
the child, what Giacomo had done with
it, she was in complete ignorance.
Vergnes, her husband, knew no more
than she, and the only means of obtaining
information was to apply directly to
Giacomo. But Giacomo was still the
same restless being, appearing at a
moment when he was least expected,
and disappearing at times, for whole
months, when his presence was looked
for with certainty.</p>

<p>From all this Armande could draw
but one conclusion; namely, that it would
be impossible for her to see her child
again without the permission of Giacomo,
and who could tell the price which he
would set upon this favor. On the other
hand, this child was in the care of its father,
and her own protection could never
be of such advantage to it as that of this
powerful and extraordinary man.&mdash;Whether
Rosine spoke thus, prompted
by Barati, or whether she told the truth,
her words sank into Armande's soul,
and acquired form and consistence.
She was distressed at the thoughts of
eternal separation from her infant, but
her own peace of mind and the happiness
of her child, perhaps, seemed to require
it, and she resigned herself to her
fate.</p>

<p>On the morning after Rosine's visit,
Barati appeared as if he were perfectly
ignorant of what had passed. His first
words, more free, more familiar, more affectionate
even than usual, restored Armande's
courage, who feared lest she
might be questioned concerning what she
had heard, and concerning the resolution
which she had formed. Perhaps, if at
this moment, Barati had made an appeal
to her gratitude, to her repentance, he
would have stirred an impulse in her
soul which might have given a different
color to the future, but, satisfied with
what he had obtained, he did not venture
to proceed farther.</p>

<p>He was contented to see this trial pass

<!-- page 157 col 1 -->

without destroying the fruits of his previous
labors. He was not sufficiently
aware that in certain circumstances
(and this is particularly the case in regard
to women), not to advance is to
lose much ground. The thought occurred
to Armande to reach her hand to
her husband and to thank him, but she
said only a few words which he did not
comprehend.</p>

<p>As he inquired after her health, she
replied, gazing steadfastly upon him:</p>

<p>"I will be ill no longer."</p>

<p>Barati either did not or would not understand
the meaning of this phrase, and
he responded without bitterness, indeed,
but without displaying any personal interest
in her words:</p>

<p>"It is a resolution which will gratify
your father."</p>

<p>Armande was not irritated at this reply,
but she checked the words which
were ready to escape from her lips.
This moment greatly deferred that reconciliation
which might and ought to
have been effected at once. Barati and
his wife resumed their usual mode of
life; it became more familiar, more convenient,
more habitual to each of them,
and fulfilled every wish that Armande
dared to hope for. A new incident was
necessary to interrupt this new routine,
and while Barati was pondering upon
the means to effect this, an event occurred
which at once destroyed all that he
had obtained. But this event and its
consequences are of sufficient importance
to be related in a separate chapter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE TESTAMENT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> a year had passed since the
day when Armande had renounced the
hope of ever seeing her child, and Barati,
thanks to the secret watch which he had
set upon his wife, satisfied that she had
not renewed her inquiries on this subject,
thought that the time had arrived
when he should grant that entire pardon
which her conduct had merited. Barati's
advances were made insensibly, and

<!-- page 157 col 2 -->

with a prudence which he thought the
sure guarantee of success. In his first
attempt he had, as it were, addressed
himself to her mind; he had established
between them an exchange of thoughts,
indifferent indeed, but familiar and almost
confiding; he next approached his
wife, not by assailing her heart, but by
interesting himself in her dress and the
adornment of her person.</p>

<p>One evening, after having returned
with her from a gay assemblage of
friends, he said to her in a tone of sadness
which excited her surprise:</p>

<p>"I am not contented with you, madam."</p>

<p>"In what respect, sir?"</p>

<p>"I almost fear to tell you, but I have
been too much chagrined at it to be silent.
It is childish, perhaps, but neither
you nor I can reform the world; it is
necessary to take it as it is, to live as it
lives."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, sir."</p>

<p>"Listen, Armande (it was the first
time that this name had passed Barati's
lips since the evening of his marriage),
I can perfectly understand that you care
but little for dress; it is an employment,"
he murmured with a sigh, "which interests
the happy alone; still it should
not entirely be despised."</p>

<p>"I think that I am suitably dressed,"
said Armande, who did not see at what
he was aiming.</p>

<p>"Suitably!" said Barati, "that is
true, but perhaps too simply."</p>

<p>"Too simply?" rejoined Armande.</p>

<p>"You are young, you&mdash;you&mdash;are
beautiful," said Barati, hesitating at this
word; "our fortune permits, nay, enjoins
a certain style, and it is impossible
that the extreme simplicity of your dress
should not be the subject of remark. It
is true the world will not know the true
cause, but it will account for it by imputing
to you, and perhaps to me, a vice
which is disgraceful at any age, but
which is degrading at ours. It will be
said that this simplicity arises from low
and sordid avarice. I am unwilling to
be accused of this vice, I am unwilling
that you should be suspected of it. Act
differently then, for the future. I overheard
some very annoying whispers on
this subject at the assembly this evening.

<!-- page 158 col 1 -->

They offended me, they grieved me.
Believe me, it cost me much pain to utter
a remark which you might consider
as a command, while it is in truth nothing
more than advice, yet I hope that you
will heed it."</p>

<p>The tone in which Barati spoke,
strangely disturbed Armande. The
words, "you are beautiful!" pronounced
with difficulty and with a deep sigh, revealed
to her more clearly than he wished
perhaps, that he had once admired
this beauty, which was now a stranger
to him.</p>

<p>This interview recalled to Armande's
thoughts the singularity of her position,
and from an impulse, entirely feminine,
when her husband had left the chamber,
she stepped to the mirror, and saw in
truth that she was beautiful, and she reflected
that she was scarcely twenty
years, and she began to weep over her
twenty years and her beauty. She repulsed
the thoughts that were thronging
upon her soul; she took refuge in prayer,
and when the day dawned, she left
her bed more destitute of courage and
resolution than ever. On the following
day Armande found in her chamber an
assortment of rich stuffs, of beautiful
laces, and of rare and precious jewels.</p>

<p>"You know," said her husband, "that
we have a celebration of the Floral
Games at the academy next week. All
the gay world of Toulouse will be present,
you ought not to go thither dressed
in a manner unsuited to your condition,
and it is right that you should appear
there in all the splendor of your beauty. I
beg you to think of it therefore."</p>

<p>Armande obeyed, and at the appointed
day, when she entered the saloon in
which her husband was waiting for her,
she was greatly embarrassed, her eyes
were cast to the ground, and her cheeks
were covered with blushes, for she felt
that she was beautiful. Barati gazed
steadfastly upon her, and remained silent.</p>

<p>This silence perplexed Armande;
tears came into her eyes, and she said
to Barati:</p>

<p>"I am too richly dressed, am I not,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, in a strange tone.
"Your dress is of the same material as

<!-- page 158 col 2 -->

that worn by the wife of my colleague,
Durand, and these jewels are not more
valuable than those of your acquaintance;
but it is not your fault if with
this attire your beauty gives you the air
of a 'queen.' "</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" said Armande in great
agitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Barati, in a tone of
sadness and repressed vexation, "yes,
yes, you are beautiful, more beautiful
than any woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and then added hastily:</p>

<p>"Come, come, it is time to go!"</p>

<p>When Armande appeared in the hall
of the Floral Games, she was received
with a murmur of admiration, and from
an emotion which she was unable to repress,
she cast a glance upon her husband;
he seemed sad and absorbed in
thought. She was alarmed and regretted
her triumph; she became sad in her turn.</p>

<p>When they returned home, Barati
said to her in a kind tone:</p>

<p>"You have done things only by half,
madam. Why did you appear so sad?"</p>

<p>"Were you not sad also?" she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! I, madam! it is very different;
I am very unhappy!"</p>

<p>"And do you think that I am happy?"
said Armande.</p>

<p>"No, certainly, madam, no," said
Barati; "but in addition to a past misfortune,
you do not suffer a daily torture;
you have had the courage to submit
to a great sacrifice, and whatever
grief may remain, it is but the grief for
a duty which you have accomplished.
But I have other sorrows."</p>

<p>Armande gazed upon him in astonishment,
and said:</p>

<p>"You, sir?"</p>

<p>"In truth," he rejoined, as if hurried
away by the violence of his emotions,
"in truth, you were very beautiful to-day,
and it seemed to me as if the world
now for the first time acknowledged it.
Every eye was fastened upon you, and
every glance seemed to say to me, 'You
are a happy man to be the husband of
so beautiful a woman!' and then, madam,
then you can imagine what I suffered!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," replied Armande, while
her eyes filled with tears, "you have
been so generous toward me of late&mdash;I

<!-- page 159 col 1 -->

will conceal myself from the eyes of the
world."</p>

<p>"And if you should conceal yourself,"
said Barati, "could you prevent
me from being a prey to the grief which
I have been unwilling to acknowledge
even to myself, but which has forced itself
upon my mind too sensibly to-day.
You will conceal yourself, you say? will
that prevent me from loving you, and
from being tortured at our separation?
for I do love you," he added, sinking
upon a chair, and concealing his face
with his hands, as if to veil from the
eyes of his wife the shame which he felt
at the confession of his weakness.</p>

<p>Armande was violently disturbed; the
most ardent declaration of love would
not have more deeply agitated the bosom
of the most innocent maiden. Her heart
seemed to cease its beatings; a kind of
giddiness seized her, and she was obliged
to support herself by a table to prevent
herself from falling. To call her emotion
joy, to call it grief, would be attributing
to a single sentiment, a throng of
confused hopes, of fears, of regrets, of
doubts. She burst into tears, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon dieu! mon dieu!</i> I am very
wretched!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" cried Barati, rising, "my love
terrifies you, it affrights you."</p>

<p>Armande turned towards him, and said
with, a faltering voice:</p>

<p>"I do not merit it&mdash;I no longer merit it."</p>

<p>"Armande," said Barati, taking her
hand, "all is forgotten!"</p>

<p>That hand was cold and tremulous.
Barati pressed it. Armande's limbs bent
beneath her, and sinking upon her knees,
she cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon dieu! mon dieu!</i> I would
give my life, if it could but wipe away
my guilt!"</p>

<p>Was this an avowal of the love which
the kind cares of her husband had engendered
in Armande's bosom? Was
it the voice of that gratitude which would
fain have repaid his generous forgetfulness
by a happiness unmingled with remorse?
Was it the terror which she
felt at a passion so suddenly revealed?</p>

<p>Barati replied to her exclamation by a
moral sentence.</p>

<p>"Armande," he said, "repentance is

<!-- page 159 col 2 -->

equivalent to innocence in the eyes of
the Deity."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that this fine maxim
was at this moment sadly out of
place; in what respect did Master Barati
resemble the Deity, that he should
look upon repentance as innocence?</p>

<p>He left Armande after this unfortunate
speech. She was not vexed with
him for having uttered it, but she grew
more calm, her emotion subsided, and
she resolved to await with resignation the
lot which the future had in store for her.</p>

<p>About this time M. de Lostanges was
attacked by a violent and dangerous illness,
and Armande wished to watch at
her father's pillow.</p>

<p>Barati approved of her resolution, encouraged
her to persevere in it, and even
went so far as to remind her of her cares
for him, and of his injustice toward her
under similar circumstances; he thus
drew Armande's heart a step nearer to
his own, but a single word was sufficient
to lay in utter ruin the enterprise which
he had hitherto pursued with such perseverance.</p>

<p>One day Armande returned home in
a state of extreme anxiety; her father's
malady had increased, and his life seemed
in imminent danger.</p>

<p>Barati appeared more alarmed at this
news than was natural in a son-in-law.</p>

<p>"And is he aware of his condition?"
he said.</p>

<p>"So much so that he has sent for his
notary and for a priest."</p>

<p>Barati gazed upon Armande with an
expression so extraordinary, so anxious,
and at the same time so menacing, that
she could not prevent herself from saying:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Barati, "if M. de
Lostanges dies in the position in which
we now stand, we lose his inheritance."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" said Armande,
endeavoring to comprehend her husband's
aim.</p>

<p>"I mean that you must declare that
you have a certain hope of becoming a
mother."</p>

<p>"But it would be a falsehood," cried.
Armande.</p>

<p>"Is not our existence a tissue of falsehoods?"
rejoined Barati, in a tone of

<!-- page 160 col 1 -->

smothered fury&mdash;"you must say this to
your father, madam. It is my wish;
it must be so. My indulgence for your
past errors deserves this service on your
part."</p>

<p>Barati's avarice had rendered him forgetful
of his address and patience.&mdash;These
words at once unveiled to Armande
all the horrible hypocrisy of his
pretended love. She must be a mother
to enrich Barati&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>This blow was so terrible, so unlocked
for, that Armande was stupefied and bewildered;
but she refused to lend herself
to the falsehood which he required
of her. Her resistance was vain, however,
for Barati, with the threat upon his
lips to reveal to her dying father the
guilt and infamy of his daughter, compelled
her to obedience, and on that
very evening she uttered and affirmed
to M. de Lostanges, the falsehood which
Barati had dictated to her.</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said M. de Lostanges,
"the testament which has been
drawn up, will become void, and at the
proper time it shall be placed in your
husband's hands by the notary who received
it to-day."</p>

<p>Barati was well acquainted with the
principles of jurisprudence, and he remembered
that axiom of the Roman law
which has been embodied in all the modern
codes:</p>

<p>"<i>Infans pro nato habetur quoties de
suis commodis agetur</i>."</p>

<p>"An infant is considered as born in
all cases where it concerns its interests."</p>

<p>But it was necessary that this infant
should be born within a time which could
not be prolonged. The following was
the project, then, that Barati dared to
propose to his wife:</p>

<p>"I have driven from my house," he
said, "the child which was a stranger
to me; your love for it rendered it odious
to me. The child, a stranger to us
both, which it is now necessary to receive
into our house, will, at least, suffer
no prejudice from any remembrance dishonorable
to you or to myself."</p>

<p>We will not, recount the threats, the
acts of violence by which he compelled
Armande to counterfeit a situation which
did not, and which now could never exist,
for all hopes of reconciliation were

<!-- page 160 col 2 -->

at an end. Armande obeyed. Often
she was tempted to tell the truth, for M.
de Lostanges was dead, and she had no
longer to fear his grief or indignation.
She often asked herself if she should
not take cruel vengeance upon her husband's
avarice, by terminating her own
life, and thus cheat his hopes; but Armande
had suffered beyond her strength.</p>

<p>She obeyed, as we have said, but she
had still the firmness to obtain by this
concession a promise from Barati that he
would permit her to end her days in
seclusion.</p>

<p>The time approached. One night,
when all in the house were asleep, the
advocate entered the garden gate, ascended
the stairs, proceeded to his wife's
chamber, and said:</p>

<p>"Here is your daughter, madam; here
is the heiress of the property of M. de
Lostanges."</p>

<p>A moment after, a domestic was despatched
in search of a physician, whose
services had been secured by a large
bribe, and in a few days the daughter
of Vergnes and Rosine was christened
by the name of Clemence Barati. The
reader has seen how she became the
Countess D'Auterive.</p>

<p>But previous to the day of the christening
a singular scene occurred in the house
of Barati, who had now become a councillor
of the parliament. According to
the law, a child born, and seized of its
rights to an inheritance, possessed it
irrevocably, and, though it lived but for
an hour, all collateral claims were rendered
void. Barati therefore demanded
the testament of his father-in-law from
the notary of M. de Lostanges, as it was
now invalid. This testament was
brought to the councillor's house by an
aged clerk, dressed in an old snuff-colored
coat, with a yellow and wrinkled visage.</p>

<p>"Will you examine it?" he said, "to
see if it is the one you wanted?"</p>

<p>Barati broke the seal, cast a hasty
glance over the testament, and with a
smile of satisfaction, tossed it into the
fire, uttering in a tone of mockery the
word, "<i>Uri</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Ure</i>," rejoined the old man, in a sarcastic
voice.</p>

<p>"How!" said Barati, "what mean
you?"</p>

<!-- page 161 col 1 -->

<p>"That your joy has made you forget
your latin, Master Barati."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said the latter, laughing.
"Let it be <i>Ure</i>, I do not insist upon
<i>Uri</i>."</p>

<p>"But I insist upon it," said the old
man, "for I uttered the word one day
when flying from great danger, and
dying of thirst, I parodied the sentence
of St. Thomas, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Melius est sitire quam uri</i>. It is
better to be thirsty than to be burned."</p>

<p>Barati rose suddenly, and fixing a
piercing glance upon the speaker, he
said:</p>

<p>"And the danger from which you
was flying was that of being burned?"</p>

<p>"As a sorcerer, Master Barati."</p>

<p>"You?" cried Barati, recoiling, and
recognizing the man who stood before
him.</p>

<p>"I, Master Barati, whom you would
gladly burn, doubtless, as you have
burned this testament; I who, without
being a sorcerer, have divined what has
become of Vergnes' child."</p>

<p>"Wretch!" said Barati, "I have thee
at last!"</p>

<p>"Barati," said Giacomo, drawing a
poignard, "were you stronger and
braver than you are, you could not slay
me so quickly but that I should have
time to accuse Rosine of having disposed
of her child, and when the choice
is offered her between the truth and the
scaffold, you ought to know what she
would say. The world would learn
that you have purchased her child to
pass it off for yours."</p>

<p>Barati's head dropped upon his
breast.</p>

<p>"And now," continued Giacomo,
"now, that I hold you by your crimes,
I warn you that if you make a single
attempt to discover me, it will lead to
your destruction rather than to mine.
I have business in this part of the country,
and I wish to be at liberty here."</p>

<p>With these words he left the house,
before Barati, who was stupefied at his
boldness, thought of arresting him.</p>

<p>Now that the reader is acquainted with
the origin of the mysterious word <i>Uri</i>,
which had been recalled to Barati's
remembrance in the castle of La Roque,
and which had terrified him even more

<!-- page 161 col 2 -->

than the fearful date of the 20th of
November 1683, we will inform him
what this business was to which Giacomo
had just referred.</p>

<p class="small">THE CAVERNS OF LA ROQUE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> business that Giacomo wished
to attend to without hindrance, was the
establishment of that vast association for
the making of counterfeit coins, in which
he desired to engage the most influential
inhabitants of the province; but his
project was long delayed from the difficulty
which he found in discovering a
spot suitable to an establishment like
that he meditated. If the reader asks
what was the aim of Giacomo in such
an enterprise, when he was already in
possession of considerable wealth, we
must give the explanation (a strange one
to say the least), which we have found
in the old manuscript of which we
have spoken. Giacomo lived, as we
learn from it, at an age not far removed
from the time when the Duke de Rohan,
outlawed and condemned to death, had
negotiated with the Porte for the purchase
of the isle of Candia, where he
wished to establish a new throne. He
had seen the Chevalier de Guines, ready
to seize the kingdom of Naples, and
wrest it from the dominion of Spain, if
he had but been seconded by the French
fleet, or if he had possessed the means
of supporting for a while, the rebellion
of Masaniello.</p>

<p>The man whom we have seen tending
the sheep of a fuller in the Pyrenees
had dreamed of a kingdom. Trifling
as this kingdom might be, lost perhaps,
amid the numerous islands of the Mediterranean,
he wished to be a sovereign,
and thus present to the world the spectacle
of a man condemned to the vilest
punishment, becoming the founder of a
new dynasty. The wealth which had
been accumulated by the Prince of Puzzano
was already considerable, but the
trade of a corsair, by which he had acquired
the greater part of it, had grown
too hazardous; not that he feared the

<!-- page 162 col 1 -->

danger of strife, but he was well aware
that if the true name of the pirate who
infested the Mediterranean should be
discovered, whatever success and whatever
impunity might attend him, it would
raise an insuperable barrier to the accomplishment
of his projects.</p>

<p>His first step was to establish in the
city of Toulouse, a workshop, where
he fabricated those counterfeit coins in
which he mingled a sufficient alloy of
gold and silver to enable them to endure
a tolerable close inspection; but he was
soon sensible that his secret and that of
his associates would quickly be discovered
in a populous city, where each neighbor is
curious to know what passes in the house
adjacent to his own.</p>

<p>He then resolved to transfer the establishment
to Spain, and he directed the
Comte de Frias, who was the right arm
of all his plans, and who, remaining at
Toulouse, kept him advised of all that
passed there to seek out a place more
suitable for their purposes. The comte,
well supplied with money for the purchase
of some isolated mansion, upon
the frontiers of Spain and France, left
Toulouse on horseback with Don Jos&eacute;,
and as Giacomo had entrusted him at
the same time with a considerable sum
to place in the hands of Fran&ccedil;ois Gali,
for the care which he took of his son,
he stopped at the castle of the Baron de
la Roque, whom he had met at the Princess
of Puzzano's.</p>

<p>The Comte de Frias, after having been
so imprudent as to inform the baron of the
sums which he had with him, entered the
chamber which had been prepared for
him, laid aside his clothes and threw
himself upon his bed; scarcely had he
done this when he heard the door opened,
beheld two men enter, and he received
a poignard stroke, which fortunately
glanced aside from his ribs; the pain
and loss of blood deprived him of consciousness.</p>

<p>When his senses returned, he found
himself in utter darkness. He rose and
groped about him. The truth now flashed
across his mind; it was evident that the
Baron de la Roque, after having stabbed
him in order to seize his treasures, had
carried him to a vault, to remove all
traces of the deed. He found that he

<!-- page 162 col 2 -->

had been enveloped in the sheets and
covering of his bed, which were probably
stained with blood; the baron had
believed him dead, doubtless, or perhaps
he had judged it more prudent to complete
his crime, by leaving him to perish
with hunger in this vault.</p>

<p>The Comte de Frias, an associate in
the adventurous life of Giacomo, had
been thrown into situations of peril often
enough to have had occasion to exercise
the energy of his character, but what
could he hope for in this vault, constructed
as it was of thick walls, and closed by
a stone gate, so massive as to prevent the
loudest cries from reaching the ears of
those without. More than twelve hours
passed, bringing the comte no hope of relief
from his horrible situation, and in
this damp vault, cheered by no ray of
light, these twelve hours seemed to him
as many days.</p>

<p>At last, overcome with fatigue, he threw
himself upon the ground; after some
moments, he was surprised to feel a fresh
and cold current of air stream through
the fissures in the soil. He groped around
with his hands, and soon found that he
was lying upon a large flat slab, the
edges of which, imperfectly joined to the
stone frame-work that enclosed it, gave
admission to this current.</p>

<p>Was this the opening to another vault
beneath him? or was it the orifice of one
of those abysses in which feudal lords
were accustomed to bury the traces of
their crimes? it was impossible for Frias
to decide; but in a position so desperate
as his, the least chance was welcome,
and he resolved to essay it as a means of
safety.</p>

<p>In the centre of this stone there was a
large iron ring. Through this ring he
passed one of the coverings of his bed,
and succeeded more than once in raising
the stone from its place, but it fell
back again as often as he slackened his
efforts, in order to stoop and move it aside.</p>

<p>Applying himself, however, to his task
with wonderful perseverance, he placed
over the joints of the stone fine grains of
sand, in order that they might fall between
its edges and the adjacent pavement,
at the moment when he raised it,
and thus prevent it from entirely resuming
its original position.</p>

<!-- page 163 col 1 -->

<p>By little and little, effort after effort, he
was enabled to introduce into this interval,
small particles of stone, and at last to
slip his fingers beneath the slab, but at
this moment he felt his strength leaving
him. A universal weakness seized him,
he suffered the first gnawings of hunger,
and a heavy drowsiness began to overpower
him.</p>

<p>The comte, wounded as he was, fatigued
by his exertions, and by the want
of nourishment, was aware that if he
yielded to this drowsiness, instead of
proving a refreshing repose, it would but
deprive him of the little strength which
remained to him. He rose with the energy
of despair, and sensible that he was
incapable of prolonged and patient efforts,
he wound about his body the cloth which
he had passed through the ring, and then
started backward with all his strength;
the stone was lifted from the orifice and
completely displaced, but the comte, not
expecting that it would yield so easily,
tottered backward, and striking his head
against the wall, he fell to the ground insensible.</p>

<p>Whether he swooned entirely, or
whether the drowsiness which he had
thus far resisted, overpowered him during
his unconsciousness, he was never
able to decide; but when his senses returned
he had completely forgotten what
had passed, so that upon rising and advancing
at random in the darkness, he
stepped into the orifice which had been
left open by the removal of the stone,
and the next moment he felt himself hanging
in the air in a large circular hole,
suspended by the cloth which he had
wound about his body, and which still remained
fastened to the iron ring. It was
not until he was in this perilous position
that he remembered what had occurred,
and the efforts which he had made to escape
from his confinement.</p>

<p>This was now practicable, perhaps, for
by tying together the coverings of his
bed he might be enabled to descend to
the bottom of this hole, which, doubtless,
offered some way of egress, since he
could hear the murmuring of water at a
moderate depth beneath him, and when
he glanced below he perceived a light,
which could only proceed through some
fissure that gave passage, doubtless, to

<!-- page 163 col 2 -->

the same. But the comte had not the
strength to remount to the orifice of this
well, and no other alternative seemed left
him except to die thus suspended over
the abyss, or to disengage himself from
the cloth which supported him, and to end
his sufferings by plunging into the waters
below.</p>

<p>While in this fearful situation, the
thought occurred to him that the lapse of
time might have eaten some interstices in
the walls of this well, by which he might,
perhaps, grapple and clamber down as
upon a ladder. He gave an impulse,
therefore, to the cloth, in order to swing
toward the wall, and was greatly surprised
at coming in contact with an obstacle
which seemed to him like a bar of
iron. He repeated this man&oelig;uvre, and
touched it again, although he was unable
to grasp it, as it was nearly upon a level
with his feet. He gave himself a new
impulse, and found a similar object behind
him opposite his head; he seized it
and perceived that it was a bar of iron,
which descended spirally down the length
of the wall. He placed himself astride
upon this bar, and discovering that it ran
at a good distance from the wall, he conceived
it to be the railing of a stairway,
which descended probably to the bottom
of this abyss.</p>

<p>This arrangement, which will doubtless
surprise our readers, was sufficiently
common in those castles, which had served
for fortresses, and the comte at once
felt that he was saved. The feudal mansions
of the seigneurs of this province,
reared, almost invariably, upon the
heights which commanded the surrounding
country, owed to their position a
strength almost impregnable, at a time
when the use of artillery was unknown.
But this position exposed the occupants
to a scarcity of water, and when they
were invested with vigilance and perseverance,
they were almost always obliged
to surrender.</p>

<p>It was to obviate this difficulty, that,
when the situation permitted, they dug
immense wells, which opened upon some
stream, and in some cases reached by
subterranean vaults, to a neighboring
river. The castle of Carcassonne contained
one of these wells; the towers of
Foix still show the traces of a similar

<!-- page 164 col 1 -->

structure, which reached to the borders
of the Arri&eacute;ge. The secret of the existence
of these wells was transmitted from
generation to generation, and there are
examples of servants who have lived in
these castles during a long life without
suspecting the existence of these private
passages.</p>

<p>Such a reservoir had been long useless
to the castle of la Roque, which
could not now be subjected to a siege,
and for more than fifty years, the passage
which led to the orifice of this huge
well had remained closed.</p>

<p>The comte extricated himself from
the covering, to which he was still fastened,
and found the stairway in a state
of preservation which permitted him to
descend with ease. He soon reached a
kind of reservoir, in which he could
wash his wound, and slake his thirst.
He then began to look about for a way
of escape, and discovered a succession
of natural caverns, which conducted
him at last to the spot from which the
stream issued which supplied the reservoir;
this spot he recognized as the one
which we have described in a preceding
chapter, and which was known by the
name of the Wolf's Niche, a spot which
was considered inaccessible. The comte,
who had before visited this part of the
country, recalled to mind the old tradition
of the wolf which had been seen
upon this platform; and he reflected that
since this animal had appeared there,
there must necessarily be some other
way of egress from these excavations.</p>

<p>Frias resumed his researches, strengthened
and encouraged by hope, and discovered
at last a passage, which opened
upon a hill side, so covered with holms
and box trees, and so choked with
briars, that it seemed impossible that
either man or beast could have passed
through it for many years.</p>

<p>The comte made his way through
this passage, and hastened to conceal
himself in the house of Fran&ccedil;ois Gali;
the latter informed him of the report
which the baron had spread abroad respecting
his departure for the Indies,
and the trust which had been confided
to his hands. Reassured as to the safety
of his son, the comte assumed one
of those disguises which Giacomo had

<!-- page 164 col 2 -->

taught him to prepare, and reached Toulouse,
where he recounted to the prince
the adventure which had interrupted his
journey.</p>

<p>Giacomo made him repeat, again and
again his description of these numerous
natural caverns, inquired after their
extent, and then at last, replied:</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> comte, your journey is at
an end, and your money is far from
being lost, for we have found that of
which we were in search."</p>

<p>"Do you intend, then," said M. de
Frias, "to admit this wretch de la
Roque into your confidence?"</p>

<p>"By no means," rejoined the prince;
"the baron, with all the crimes that
would bind him to us, has one failing
that would induce me to reject him,
were he ours by a hundred times more
vices; he is a drunkard, and there is no
security for a secret, whatever it may
be, if confided to a man who at times
loses his reason. Besides," he added,
"what better safeguard can we have
than the ignorance of the owner
of the castle, and should he ever
discover our secret, what surer means
to silence him than to threaten him with
the disclosure of his crime."</p>

<p>We will not enter into more circumstantial
details in order to inform the
reader by what steadfast perseverance,
by what extraordinary means, Giacomo
succeeded in establishing in these caverns,
the workshop of his fraudulent coin,
and the store-house of his vast wealth.
To this end he often enticed the baron
from his castle, and it was during his
absence, and after he had engaged the
menials in some bacchanalian revel,
that he was enabled to explore the mansion,
and to discover various other secret
passages which led to these caverns, of
the existence of which the baron had not
the slightest suspicion. This fact will
explain the incessant supervision which
the associates were enabled to exercise
in the interior of the castle, and when in
process of time, Don Jos&eacute; had reached
an age, at which he could be entrusted
with the secret, his father found means
to reveal himself to him, and thus secured
a spy in the very bosom of the
baron's household. It only remains to
us now to explain the chance by which

<!-- page 165 col 1 -->

D'Auterive found himself entangled in
this association, and the result of the
ambitious hopes which Giacomo had so
long nourished. This will be the subject
of a new chapter, after which we
shall resume the threads of this narrative,
which, complicated as they were,
were still held in the hands of a single
man.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

<p class="small">INITIATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Giacomo had at last found a
retreat which was favorable to the accomplishment
of his projects, he began to
extend his relations with the most influential
persons of the province. The
reader will easily understand how he
succeeded in inducing his brother-in-law,
the Duke de Nevers, to join the association,
how, strong in the ties which bound
to him a number of accomplices, who,
with the exception of a few, were unacquainted
with each other, he had been
enabled to profit by the secrets of some,
and the passions of others to hold them
all under his control. It was for this
reason that, when consulted by Don Jos&eacute;
respecting his love for Paula, he had
urged the youth to dare every thing; by
this means he held in his power a woman,
who, dwelling in the elastic of la
Roque, might become dangerous to him.</p>

<p>Giacomo had long since taken up his
abode in the house of Gali under the
name of Pastourel, and in the capacity
of a shepherd, in order to watch the operations
in which he was engaged, when
Don Jos&eacute; came to consult him as a skilful
sorcerer. In truth, with the exception
of Frias and old Gali, none of the
associates of the mountain knew either
who he really was, or the interest which
he felt in their enterprise. He often
repaired to the caverns where they were
at work, but always in some disguise,
which prevented him from being recognized
by those who might afterwards
meet him in his shepherd's garb.</p>

<p>Don Jos&eacute;, therefore, urged by certain
insinuations from his father, imagined
that he was merely consulting a village

<!-- page 165 col 2 -->

sorcerer, while he was unwittingly the
instrument of a settled project. The
reader is aware of the results, and the
guilty Paula had been for two years the
Baroness de la Roque, when D'Auterive
paid a visit to the castle of his uncle and
godfather. Paula was beautiful, and of
an age so disproportioned to that of
her husband, that D'Auterive expected
little difficulty in tempting her from a
fidelity that must be burdensome to her.</p>

<p>He made the trial, and was surprised
to find himself repulsed.</p>

<p>Instead of viewing this resistance as
the effect of rigid virtue, he attributed it
to a passion which had anticipated his
own; he watched her, and whether he
saw more clearly than the Baron de la
Roque, or whether Don Jos&eacute;'s resentment
at D'Auterive's attentions to Paula, rendered
him less prudent in the presence
of his rival, the young officer soon suspected
the <i>liaison</i> which existed between
his aunt and the baron's ward.</p>

<p>Although by no means of a malicious
disposition, yet D'Auterive was greatly
vexed that another should have been preferred
to him, and was seized with an unaccountable
zeal for his godfather's honor,
which he would not have hesitated to
compromise for his own gratification, and
he gave the two guilty ones very clearly
to understand that he would constitute
himself the avenger of the baron's
wrongs.</p>

<p>The case was a serious one, and Don
Jos&eacute;, alarmed for himself, for his associates,
and for Paula, imparted his fears
to his father. But Pastourel was at hand,
Pastourel, who by a strange tissue of circumstances
held all their secrets in his
hands, and who, even in the eyes of his
most intimate confederates, appeared to
be a being endowed with almost supernatural
power. Pastourel was no sooner
advised of this occurrence, which might
lead to the expulsion of their spy from
the castle, than he traced out to Don Jos&eacute;
through his father, the course which he
had to pursue.</p>

<p>In obedience to the plan which was
pointed out to him, Don Jos&eacute;, feigning
great alarm, persuaded Paula to meet
him without the castle, and so contrived
it that D'Auterive should suspect their
design and be induced to follow them.</p>

<!-- page 166 col 1 -->

<p>All happened as Pastourel had foreseen.
After nightfall D'Auterive followed
Paula as she left the castle, and at
the moment when she was joined by Don
Jos&eacute;, who drew her rapidly onward, and
D'Auterive was on the point of pursuing
them, he was suddenly seized, bound,
gagged, and carried to a considerable
distance. Here he found himself surrounded
by five or six masked men who
put various questions to him; he answered
like a man of courage, but they
threatened him with death, and when
they explained to him the conditions by
which he could save his life, he seemed
disposed to accede to them.</p>

<p>In this state of things, Pastourel, concealed
by a disguise, unknown even to
his associates, enacted one of those
scenes which concurred to strengthen
their opinion that he was possessed of
some supernatural power. At the moment
when they were about to explain
more fully to D'Auterive the conditions
which would be required of him, Pastourel
took up the word, and said:</p>

<p>"This man has belonged to us from
the day of his birth, and the hour for his
initiation has arrived."</p>

<p>"I belong to myself alone," said
D'Auterive, "and to the service of the
king, my master."</p>

<p>"Open his doublet," said Pastourel,
"and see if he does not wear upon his
breast a piece of gold which proves that
he is ours."</p>

<p>This command was obeyed, and the
piece of gold was found which Giacomo,
more than twenty years ago had given
to D'Auterive's nurse, and which the
young man had preserved on account of
the superstitious virtue which she had
attributed to it.</p>

<p>"Read the sacred words which are
inscribed thereon," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>The Comte de Frias, who was present
at this scene, read with unfeigned astonishment,
the Arabian characters which
signified:</p>

<p>"Speech is silver, but silence is gold."</p>

<p>D'Auterive stood amazed, while Pastourel
resumed:</p>

<p>"Is it thus you have been taught them,
young man?"</p>

<p>"It is," replied D'Auterive with an
air of stupefaction.</p>

<!-- page 166 col 2 -->

<p>"And they should have added, that
when you heard these words uttered
near you, fortune would not be far distant."</p>

<p>"It is true!" said the young officer.</p>

<p>"Set him at liberty," rejoined Pastourel,
"he is ours. I have predestined
him to a high fortune, but like the rest
of us he must sign with his own hand
the deed of our association, for he must
be saved or lost with us."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his alarm, and the
astonishment with which he viewed
this man, who recalled to his memory
a circumstance which had so long been
forgotten, D'Auterive refused to sign
before knowing to what he pledged
himself.</p>

<p>"You pledge yourself to silence,"
said Giacomo, "and to aid to the utmost
of your power, the man, who, under
whatever circumstances, shall remind
you of the motto inscribed upon
this piece of gold."</p>

<p>D'Auterive still insisted upon knowing
the designs of those to whose power
he was thus about to subject himself.
Giacomo now explained to him that he
was in the presence of a society o£ counterfeiters,
and his comrades testified
some surprise at the strange imprudence
of their chief. Still D'Auterive obstinately
refused to yield, and the associates
saw themselves compelled, to secure
their safety by a crime at which
all recoiled. But Giacomo, raising his
voice, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He will sign, I say!"</p>

<p>Then approaching D'Auterive, he
said, in an under tone:</p>

<p>"Madman that you are, child of my
choice and protection, it becomes you
well, you, whom I have destined from
birth to an exalted fortune, to refuse to
sigh this deed! It becomes you well to
hesitate, when led by forbidden curiosity,
you have placed our secret in peril!"</p>

<p>"What curiosity?" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Have you not come hither as a spy
upon the meeting of Don Jos&eacute; de Frias
with the Baroness de la Roque?"</p>

<p>"I should think," replied D'Auterive,
"that my uncle's honor interests me
more nearly than any one else."</p>

<p>"And do you think," said Giacomo,

<!-- page 167 col 1 -->

speaking in a still lower tone, "that the
honor of the duke De Nevers interests
no one, and have you imagined, you,
the lover of Leonore of Puzzano, duchess
De Nevers, that you could not be
punished, as you wish to punish this
Don Jos&eacute;?"</p>

<p>This revelation completed D'Auterive's
dismay.</p>

<p>"Whence know you?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I know all," said Giacomo, "sign&mdash;it
is to save more than your life&mdash;it is
to save the honor of a woman who has
entrusted her happiness to your keeping."</p>

<p>D'Auterive signed the deed, and Giacomo's
associates, who were in possession
of those secrets only which he was
willing they should penetrate, were not
less astonished than the young officer
at the strange influence which this man
exerted over all around him.</p>

<p>The reader is now informed of the
manner in which D'Auterive was placed
in the power of the counterfeiters; he is
acquainted with the means by which
they were enabled to enact that nocturnal
scene in which they forced the baron
to obey their commands, and in which
they succeeded in securing Barati's silence,
by recalling to his memory that
date and that word which had so greatly
terrified him.</p>

<p>If, in addition to this, the reader will
remember that the danger with which
the councillor was threatened, was
averted by Pastourel's intervention, who
forced the duke to silence, and protected
at once Leonore, the baron De la Roque,
D'Auterive, and all those whose safety
was compromised, he will understand
the sway which he held over this association.
It will be remembered also
that it was he who announced the burning
of the castle of La Roque, a deed
which had been committed by Galidou
at his instigation, and we must explain
the reasons which prompted him to destroy
an establishment to build up which,
he had devoted the best part of his life.
On the one hand, the attention of the
parliament of Toulouse had been so
thoroughly aroused, that it seemed certain
that a decree would be passed, directing
a perquisition at the castle of
La Roque, and when once a body of

<!-- page 167 col 2 -->

soldiers were quartered within its walls,
the slightest accident might lead them
to the caverns in which Giacomo had
stored his treasures. On the other
hand, at the time when this danger revealed
itself, these treasures were simply
sufficient for our adventurer for the
hopes which he had so long nourished,
and to the accomplishment of which he
had devoted so much toil and patience,
had vanished.</p>

<p>It is well known to what a state of
weakness and poverty France had fallen
during the latter part of the reign of
Louis XIV. Money was scarce, and
was sought for on all sides, and by all
methods; loans were difficult to obtain
from the difficulty of finding securities,
so that it may easily be imagined that
a man who offered a sum of nearly
twenty millions of livres, and upon a
simple condition which he held in reserve
until the conclusion of the negotiation,
would meet with a ready hearing.
This man was the prince of
Puzzano; he appeared at the moment
when Villars, seizing in quick succession
Spire, Worms and Landau, seemed
destined to restore to the aged monarch
the brilliant triumphs of his youth; but
these triumphs had drained the last resources
of the State, and notwithstanding
her new victories, France, almost
incapable of pursuing them, was destined
to lose the fruits which they should have
produced to her.</p>

<p>In the negotiations which followed
the peace of Rastadt for partitioning
Europe anew, the prince of Puzzano
imagined that France would have a
preponderating voice, and at his suggestion,
the ministers of Louis demanded
Sardinia. Giacomo had engaged, as
soon as it was conceded to France, to
purchase that island, for the sum of
thirty millions. England opposed this
arrangement, however, and the kingdom
of Naples with Sardinia, was given to
Austria.</p>

<p>All that the prince of Puzzano could
now obtain, was the promise of a restoration
to his rank, and impunity for
the crime by which he had amassed his
wealth, an impunity for which he must
pay an enormous price.</p>

<p>Such were the explanations which he

<!-- page 168 col 1 -->

gave to the duke De Nevers, his brother-in-law,
and to the baron De la Roque,
during the secret interview which followed
the scene in which he consigned to
the flames the deed of their association.</p>

<p>But the prince, fallen from his lofty
hopes, was unwilling to accept a restoration,
a public one at least, as the price
of so many efforts, and of a life devoted
to so much toil. In his eye it was
scarcely worth the while, for so feeble a
satisfaction to draw the eyes of the
world upon his past life, and upon the
path which he had pursued to reach his
aim. The restoration of his rights and
titles, obtained by the secret intervention
of France, was an affair that did not
excite the least noise, and he had reaped
no other advantage from it than the recognition
of Galidou as the son of the
prince of Puzzano, with the tide of
Marquis of Veroni, a title which, as
such, rightfully belonged to him. Both
then disappeared from Languedoc, and
it was not until long after that they returned
to find themselves in the presence
of the same persons with whom they
had been thrown in contact fifteen years
before. These persons were D'Auterive,
the baron De la Roque, Barati,
Clemence, Galidou, the duchess De Nevers,
Paula, all of whom indeed we
have already introduced to the reader,
and whose histories we will conclude in
the following chapters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will recollect, we hope so
at least, that we commenced the narrative
of the life of that man, who was
known to them only under the name of
Pastourel, at the moment when the baron
had excited Bernard's suspicions against
Charlotte. On the same day, it will be
remembered, the Comte D'Auterive, his
wife, an unknown old man, whom
Catharine had met on her way to the
ruins, were to repair thither to consult
the Solitary, Pastourel. Charlotte purposed
to come accompanied by Don

<p>In all this the sole question, as it
seemed, was the marriage of the son of
the duke De Nevers with Charlotte De
la Roque; but more than one interest,
more than one passion opposed this
marriage, and it was these passions and
these interests which led all these persons
into the presence of that man,
by whose aid they expected to gratify
them. By a singular coincidence, all
those who had advised Pastourel of
their intention to visit him, had fixed
upon eight o'clock in the evening.
Charlotte alone, was to come in the day
time, and we will accompany her first
on her way thither. It was scarcely
five o'clock when she stole from her
father's castle. Jos&eacute; or Vasconcellos
awaited her at a little distance, and they
soon reached the almost deserted road
which led to the ruins. But Bernard
had not forgotten the baron's perfidious
insinuations, and disguised as a peasant,
he had stationed himself in the environs
of the old castle, and soon beheld Charlotte
and Vasconcellos advancing rapidly
towards him. The anxious face of the
maiden, the quickness of her movements,
announced some violent agitation;
Vasconcellos spoke to her with
earnest gesticulations; he seemed to
entreat her with the ardor of a man
impelled by some violent passion.
Charlotte appeared undecided, and in
the eyes of a jealous lover her hesitation
could only be explained by a remnant
of affection for him, which still
resisted, but was upon the point of
yielding.</p>

<p>They now made their way amid the
ruins, and entered the retreat of Pastourel.
Bernard, for a moment thought
of following them and listening to their
conversation, but he knew by experience
that Pastourel kept a sentinel near him
which suffered no one to approach his
master without warning him, and that
his dog Greyfoot would announce his
arrival, even if he did not prevent it.
He resolved, therefore, not to enter the
ruins, but he took his station behind
some bushes, so that he could overhear
the conversation of Charlotte and Don

<!-- page 169 col 1 -->

Jos&eacute; on their return, and then follow
them stealthily, or stop them as they
passed him.</p>

<p>We, who have no reason to prevent
us, will accompany them upon this visit.
When they entered the presence
of Pastourel, the latter received them as
he had received Bernard, absorbed apparently
in the perusal of a book, which
engaged all his attention, an occupation
which he allowed the entrance of no
one to disturb. The habit which he
had contracted of placing his life and
actions in a striking, and us we may
say, theatrical point of view, influenced
his conduct when he least thought of it,
and although he had long passed the
age when he took delight in exciting
wonder in the minds of those with
whom he came in contact, yet he retained
unwittingly something of the
charlatan, even on those occasions
which he considered as serious, and
this was one of the number. The question
which now interested him was
whether he should consent or not to the
marriage of Charlotte and his nephew
Bernard. To a man like Pastourel,
inequality of rank and fortune, were
no motives for hesitation, but he had
promised Leonore to watch over her
son, and to secure his happiness, and
he wished to judge of Charlotte's character,
for he knew her only from public
rumor, which described her as an
angel of virtue, and from the extravagant
eulogiums of Bernard.</p>

<p>Charlotte gazed at first with curiosity
at the place in which she found herself,
and endeavored to recall some remembrances
of her childhood. She recognized
this hall, in which she had often
seen her father's domestics engaged in
their rude sports, and she said in a low
voice to Don Jos&eacute;:</p>

<p>"The conflagration has not effaced
all the hateful remembrances of this
abode."</p>

<p>Pastourel overheard her, and gazed
upon her, while she cast a disdainful
glance around her. This scrutiny was
unfavorable to Charlotte. It was in
this house that she was born, it was in
this house that she had received the
warm caresses of a mother, who loved
her with that passion and that remorse

<!-- page 169 col 2 -->

which a woman always feels for the
child of her guilt. Charlotte seemed
to wait impatiently until Pastourel
could listen to her, and he took pleasure
in prolonging her suspense. She then
said to Don Jos&eacute;:</p>

<p>"Does not this man intend to notice
us? I cannot be too long absent."</p>

<p>Don Jos&eacute; by a sign directed Charlotte
to be silent, but Pastourel said:</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Don Jos&eacute;, to wish
to calm your daughter's impatience; it
convinces me that she is more disposed
to yield to your wishes than you imagine."</p>

<p>At these words Charlotte's features
assumed that mild expression which
served so well to conceal from all eyes
her want of feeling, and she replied in
a tone of compassion:</p>

<p>"The few words which have passed
your lips, old man, are so severe, that
the purpose of my visit here seems accomplished;
I already know all that I
came to learn."</p>

<p>"No, Charlotte," replied Pastourel,
"you do not know the purpose of your
visit here, and the words which have
passed my lips have told you nothing."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Charlotte, "M. De
Frias has already told me."</p>

<p>"Do not take the trouble to inform me
of that which Frias has told you, young
maiden; I know it. He has told you
of his <i>liaison</i> with your mother; he
has told you that you are not the heiress
of the baron De la Roque, and the
remembrances of your childhood are not
so entirely effaced, but that you are sensible
that he has spoken the truth. But
I will tell you wherefore you have come
hither. Listen carefully, for I shall say
that of your father which it does not
become him to say to you. When your
mother, the unfortunate Paula, retired
to a convent, and left you in the hands
of the baron De la Roque, Don Jos&eacute;
took a vow to repair towards the child
the misfortunes which he had brought
upon the mother. He was unable to
fulfil this promise at once, for he left
France under the conviction that he
had committed murder."</p>

<p>Charlotte started, and gazed upon
Don Jos&eacute; with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Do not gaze thus your father,

<!-- page 170 col 1 -->

young maiden, this crime had been required
of him by your mother, to save
her honor, and yours also, and you have
no right to blame him when his intended
victim has pardoned him."</p>

<p>"He has pardoned him!" said Charlotte,
scarcely able to repress her indignation
at the peremptory tone in which
Pastourel addressed her.</p>

<p>"I have pardoned him, I say," replied
Pastourel, "for I know how to pardon
those who are led astray by violent passions;
I know the weakness of a heart
that burns with love, but I am without
pity for those who are governed by no
emotion but cold selfishness, for those
whose every action is guided by calculating
hypocrisy; and these, let them
clothe the baseness of their souls with
all the show of virtue, yet my eye pierces
through the disguise and I cannot
pardon them."</p>

<p>As Pastourel uttered these words he
gazed in Charlotte's face with an expression
so significant, that she turned
pale, and addressing Don Jos&eacute;, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You, who call yourself my father,
have you brought me here to be insulted?"</p>

<p>"Charlotte," cried Don Jos&eacute;, "he who
has spoken to you has been your protector
during my absence; it was he,
who, by a power which he alone can
wield, has thwarted the malicious designs
of the baron De la Roque; you
owe him gratitude, you owe him respect.
And besides, why do you apply
these words to yourself? they can in no
wise refer to you."</p>

<p>"Because she has read her own character
in these words," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" cried Don Jos&eacute; impatiently.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" echoed Charlotte in
amazement.</p>

<p>"He has kept his promise; he has not
told you who I am, and I thank him for
it; and as a proof of the interest which
I take in his welfare, I advise you to
retire Charlotte, for it does not become
me to destroy the last hope of the son
of that man, who until his death was
my most faithful and devoted friend."</p>

<p>"You are severe, Monseigneur," said
Don Jos&eacute;, "and I know not why my

<!-- page 170 col 2 -->

daughter has incurred your displeasure."</p>

<p>"You know at least, why she has
come to consult me. It is concerning
her marriage with Bernard, to which
you are opposed, and to which she
seems greatly inclined. You form your
opinion of Bernard, as I form mine of
Charlotte. In your eyes he is violent,
harsh, capricious, and certain to render
your daughter wretched, and you are so
firmly convinced of this that you have
long been persuading Charlotte to renounce
him. But notwithstanding all
your counsels, she persists in encouraging
her suitor, for the daughter of the
baron De la Roque could scarcely aspire
to an alliance with the house De
Nevers."</p>

<p>Charlotte, who had been rendered
more circumspect since she had heard
Pastourel addressed by the title of Monseigneur,
replied with feigned humility:</p>

<p>"Such an alliance is highly honorable
doubtless, but sentiments more noble
than pride, perhaps, render it precious
to me."</p>

<p>"You know that Bernard is poor,
for the immense fortune of his mother
has been squandered by the duke."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Do you know also that if you contract
this marriage, Don Jos&eacute; can bestow
upon you none of that vast wealth
which he possesses in Spain, for thanks
to my care, his entire fortune consists
in lands which he cannot alienate."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Do you know also that if you consent
to follow him, to leave this country,
to go and live with him in Spain, you
may become the wealthiest heiress in
the kingdom, and aspire to an alliance
with the most powerful Princess?"</p>

<p>"Is this true?" said Charlotte, who
had listened to Pastourel with restless
and eager curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," replied Pastourel,
"and now that you are sure of it, you
can choose the latter, if you will."</p>

<p>"Now that I am sure of it," said
Charlotte in a sad tone, "sure that Don
Jos&eacute; is my father, now that I am convinced
that nothing in this country can
rightfully belong to me; neither the name
nor the heritage of the baron De la

<!-- page 171 col 1 -->

Roque, I will submit to my destiny, I
will follow my father wherever it shall
please him to lead me, and I promise
him all the devotion all the gratitude,
all the care by which I had hoped to
bend at last the man whose name I bear."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Don Jos&eacute;, "come my
daughter, come my Charlotte, and may
heaven's blessing rest upon you, Monseigneur;
you have put an end to her
irresolution, and given to my solitary
lot a companion, a friend, a daughter!"</p>

<p>"Go then," said Pastourel, "and may
God protect you!"</p>

<p>Charlotte and Don Jos&eacute; left the ball;
and Pastourel remained alone, sunk in
reflection.</p>

<p>"I am as fond and foolish as he,"
he muttered, "he puts faith in the virtues
of this maiden, and imagines that
she follows him because she loves him;
and I, have not I imagined, that in my
son, I should find a heart which would
console me, and notwithstanding all the
silly vanity which characterizes him, I
have summoned him this evening, in
the hope of exciting in his bosom a
feeling of affection and tenderness, which
might cheer me in my solitude. Alas!
he is like this Charlotte, he calculates
what portion of my wealth he may
obtain, and is obedient only from interest.
It is the punishment of those who
have abandoned their children to the
care of strangers."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Charlotte and Don
Jos&eacute; had left the castle, and reached the
borders of the torrent. Bernard had
concealed himself at the place where he
supposed they would separate, and
where they would probably pause for a
moment to exchange a few parting
words. He had not deceived himself.
Scarcely had they reached a spot where
the road branched off in two directions,
when the man who was known to Bernard,
under the name of Vasconcellos,
said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"At midnight then&mdash;at the garden-gate."</p>

<p>"I will be there," said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"I shall have two horses close at
hand, and we can reach the frontiers of
Spain before day-break."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Charlotte, "but
let us hasten!"</p>

<!-- page 171 col 2 -->

<p>"And then," resumed Don Jos&eacute;
"you will have nothing more to fear
Charlotte; then you will be under my
protection, and neither Bernard nor the
baron De la Roque will be able to tear
you from my arms."</p>

<p>Don Jos&eacute; embraced his daughter, and
left her. Charlotte remained motionless
for a moment, and then, as if hurried
away by the thought, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will go with him!"</p>

<p>Bernard had heard all. He did not
attempt to stop her, but as if in answer
to the words which had just broken
from her lips, he muttered with fury:</p>

<p>"No, no, you shall not go with him,
Charlotte, for I will slay him first! But
I have taken an oath to the baron; I
have promised to tell him all. He may
punish Charlotte, for he has the right,
but he shall not dispute with me that of
chastising my rival."</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, he resumed his
own apparel, and presented himself before
the baron, where he found Charlotte,
quietly busied with her needle-work.</p>

<p>In the interval, Pastourel received
those whose intended visits had been
announced by Catharine, and after having
described them to the reader, we
will inform him of the result of Charlotte's
resolution and of Bernard's discovery.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

<p class="small">THE VISITS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening, and the darkness was
fast increasing. It was already difficult
to distinguish persons or objects when
the Comte D'Auterive reached the retreat
of Pastourel. The Comte was
not a man to tremble in the presence of
another, and still as he approached this
mysterious personage, a feeling of awe
oppressed his bosom, which he could
not entirely subdue. Pastourel observed
it; he was flattered by it, and while the
Comte examined him with attention, he
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am indeed the man whom
you seek, Comte D'Auterive, the man,

<!-- page 172 col 1 -->

who, fifteen years ago, at the house of
Vergnes, saved you and your accomplices
from a danger at which the boldest
trembled."</p>

<p>"I recognize you perfectly," said the
Comte, "your name is Pastourel."</p>

<p>"You have sent to request an interview
with me, to what end?"</p>

<p>"You pass for a sorcerer, master
Pastourel," replied D'Auterive, in a
tone which he tried to render sarcastic,
but which was evidently constrained;
"you ought to know what brings me
here."</p>

<p>The visage of the old man grew dark,
and he answered with some sternness:</p>

<p>"I thought that I was speaking with
a serious man, and on a serious business;
but if you prefer dealing with a
sorcerer, I will tell you why you have
come."</p>

<p>As Pastourel said this, he took the
lamp which burned near him, and
placed it so that its rays fell directly
upon the Comte's features, which he
examined with extreme attention.</p>

<p>"Must I reach you my hand," said
D'Auterive, "that you may read its
lines?"</p>

<p>"The face of a man," replied Pastourel,
"is an open book, in which I have
long since learned to read, and yours
tells me sad secrets."</p>

<p>These words and the glance which accompanied
them disturbed D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Enough of charlatanry, good fellow,"
he said, "I have no time to waste."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Pastourel, in an
icy tone, "what would you with me?"</p>

<p>"You well know," replied D'Auterive,
with a gesture of vexation.</p>

<p>From the evident reluctance of the
Comte to declare the intention of his
visit, Pastourel divined that he had not
come to consult him openly and frankly
upon the mission with which he was
entrusted. Instead of answering, he
gazed upon him in silence, and said
sadly, as if he had been alone:</p>

<p>"And still I have known him as a
hare-brained, careless man, scattering
gold, braving danger, displaying that
ready generosity which seduces even
those who blame it, and he now stands
before me absorbed in a base and sordid
passion."</p>

<!-- page 172 col 2 -->

<p>"Enough of moralizing, good fellow!&mdash;despatch!"
cried the Comte.</p>

<p>"And with what shall I despatch,
Comte D'Auterive?" rejoined Pastourel,
in a lofty tone. "I myself have no
time to waste in waiting upon your
hesitation. Speak then, or begone!
What would you of me?"</p>

<p>"I have promised to visit you, old
sorcerer," said D'Auterive, with a constrained
laugh, "and I know how ready
you are to assume the airs of an important
personage; he who sends me has
warned me of your silly pretensions.
I excuse your rudeness therefore. I
am here on the part of the Duke de
Nevers."</p>

<p>"Well then," rejoined Pastourel,
"what has the Duke de Nevers told
you?"</p>

<p>D'Auterive, who had remained silent
for a moment in hopes that Pastourel
would assist him to deliver his message,
was at last obliged to answer.</p>

<p>"He has directed me to speak to you
of the marriage of his son, the Marquis
de Velay with Mademoiselle de la
Roque."</p>

<p>The Comte paused again, but Pastourel,
with his eyes fixed upon his
face, still listened, and at last replied
slowly:</p>

<p>"Speak of it, Comte D'Auterive;
I hearken!"</p>

<p>"You know now the object of my
visit; I wait to hear your opinion."</p>

<p>"You have been directed to speak
to me of the marriage of Bernard with
Charlotte," said Pastourel. "I know
that you have just told me so, but why,
for what end have you been sent to
me?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said D'Auterive,
"that I have just told you that I was
waiting for your opinion."</p>

<p>"As to what?"</p>

<p>"As to the propriety of permitting
or preventing the marriage."</p>

<p>"And if I think that it should not
take place?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"It shall not take place," said D'Auterive,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Pastourel, "and if on
the contrary, I think it is advantageous
and necessary?"</p>

<!-- page 173 col 1 -->

<p>"I cannot see its advantage and necessity,"
said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"That is not the question, sir; what
would be done in that case?"</p>

<p>The comte contracted his lips, and
Pastourel, in a tone slightly marked
with scorn, added:</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive, the Duke de
Nevers has told you that he would
refer the question of this marriage to
my sole decision; you have in your
pocket a written paper, which authorizes
you to consent if I permit it, to
oppose it if I refuse, and you are not here
to ask my opinion, but for my orders."</p>

<p>"Since you are so well informed,
sir," rejoined the comte, "it was scarcely
worth the while to wait for me to
speak."</p>

<p>"I wished to have your opinion upon
this marriage."</p>

<p>"I do not see how it interests me."</p>

<p>"I am a man to whom one may
speak plainly," rejoined Pastourel; "in
the first place, because it is not easy to
conceal any thing from me, and secondly,
because I have reached an age when
there are few passions which I do not
comprehend, and cannot pardon. You
do not wish this marriage to take
place."</p>

<p>"And why so, if you please?" replied
D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Because you think that the son of
duke De Nevers would degrade himself
by espousing the daughter of the baron
De la Roque."</p>

<p>"And would it be so very wonderful,
if I thought thus?" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"So much the less wonderful," said
Pastourel, "as you are not without a
suspicion that Charlotte is not the
daughter of the baron De la Roque."</p>

<p>D'Auterive gazed inquisitively at
Pastourel, and said, in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Do you know it also?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps well enough to give you
proof of it."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said D'Auterive, leaning
toward Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied the latter; "and
you see what an admirable two edged
sword this proof would become in your
hands. Bernard would not wed Charlotte,
and the baron De la Roque knowing

<!-- page 173 col 2 -->

certainly that Charlotte is not his
daughter, would turn her from his
doors, would disinherit her, and you,
comte D'Auterive, the baron's nephew
and godson, would become heir to all
his wealth. It would be a game well
played, would it not, worthy comte?"</p>

<p>D'Auterive was unable to control a
violent gesture of anger at this insinuation,
and darting a threatening glance
at Pastourel, he said:</p>

<p>"If you were better acquainted with
the man with whom you are speaking,
I would make you repent your words;
but I pardon your insolent inuendoes."</p>

<p>"Enough of bravado!" said Pastourel.
"Such is your aim."</p>

<p>"And if it were so," rejoined D'Auterive,
"would it not be just to expel the
illegitimate child from the place which
she usurps?"</p>

<p>"Do you think so, sir?" said Pastourel,
"and her mother whose disgrace
must follow hers?"</p>

<p>"She will suffer the punishment of
her guilt&mdash;this also is just."</p>

<p>At this reply Pastourel rose, and
speaking as if he were alone, he cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, brave chevalier D'Auterive!
where are you? where is the gallant
lover who would fain have silenced the
duke De Nevers, when the latter surprised
him with his wife in the house
of the innkeeper Vergnes?"</p>

<p>"Be silent, sir!" exclaimed D'Auterive,
"and respect the woman whose
secret has fallen, I know not how, into
your possession."</p>

<p>"And why should you ask me to conceal
your secrets, when you are so ready
to divulge those of others? No, no,
comte D'Auterive, justice is the same
for every one; you have just pronounced
two weighty truths; that an illegitimate
child should not usurp the place of the
rightful heir, and that a woman who
has erred, should be branded with public
infamy. I am of your opinion,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Greyfoot uttered a
low growl, and Pastourel paused; he
then added:</p>

<p>"And here comes some one probably,
who will agree with you also."</p>

<p>"Who?" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Step yonder, behind that tapestry,

<!-- page 174 col 1 -->

M. D'Auterive, and you will see what
reason you have to preach these strict
precepts of morality."</p>

<p>Prompted by an impulse of curiosity,
D'Auterive obeyed, and a moment after
his wife entered the hall. She appeared,
trembling, agitated, and at once
said:</p>

<p>"Some one follows me; I am terrified.
Beware!"</p>

<p>Greyfoot leaped up barking, and
sprang toward the door.</p>

<p>"Down!" cried Pastourel, "down!
if it is a foe we are strong enough to
receive him."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words,
when a new comer threw open the door
with violence, entered quickly, and
closed it behind him. This man was
armed, and before madam D'Auterive
had time to cry out, Pastourel said:</p>

<p>"Enter, Barati, enter! I have long
expected this interview."</p>

<p>"Ha! you have not forgotten what I
promised you!" said Barati, whose dress
and the livid paleness of whose features,
convinced Pastourel that he was that
stranger whose visit had been announced
by Catharine.</p>

<p>"I forget nothing, Barati," replied
Giacomo; "and I remember that you
promised to avenge yourself for the injuries
which I have heaped upon you.
The occasion is a fair one, and you can
avail yourself of it."</p>

<p>"What brings you here, Clemence?"
said Barati, to his daughter; "what have
you come to seek of this man?"</p>

<p>"I have come to ask his advice,
father;" replied Clemence, "and I am
astonished to find you here, when my
husband and I left you at Paris."</p>

<p>"Begone from this den, my daughter;"
said Barati, "this is no place for
you."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Pastourel, "those who
enter here cannot leave until I permit
them. This door will be opened, only
to admit a man whom you have forgotten,
Barati, but still one whom you
know."</p>

<p>"Do not think to terrify me with
your jugglery, and your prophetic airs;"
said the ex-councillor; "we know each
other."</p>

<p>"Without doubt," said Pastourel;

<!-- page 174 col 2 -->

"and you know what every encounter
with me has cost you."</p>

<p>"This one will be the last," rejoined
Barati, with an air of ferocity. "Begone,
Clemence, begone!"</p>

<p>"I have told you that she cannot.
As for you, do not agitate yourself, old
madman; a single movement to attack
me, a single signal from my eye, and
this dog, who lies at my feet, will drag
you to the earth, and throttle you like a
child."</p>

<p>The old councillor shook his head,
and replied, in a solemn tone:</p>

<p>"Neither your audacity nor your address,
nor the activity and teeth of your
dog, will save you now. He who has
resolved to give his life for the life of
his foe, is stronger than you think."</p>

<p>"In that case, master Barati, you are
about to strike a good blow for one who
is very near to you, if you have indeed
formed this noble resolution. Oh, I
can see the radiant smile of that son-in-law,
who thinks that you have lived too
long, and who already counts in his
imagination the treasures which you
will leave behind you."</p>

<p>"Be it so; it matters not!" said Barati,
"and I would double these treasures
if he could aid me in chastising you."</p>

<p>"I believe him capable of doing so,
if he could hear you;" said Giacomo,
"but the game would cost him too
dear."</p>

<p>"Let him lose or gain by it," said
Barati, "all that I can tell you," he
added, drawing a pistol from beneath
his mantle, "is that your hour has come,
Giacomo."</p>

<p>"My father!" cried Clemence, throwing
herself in his way, "would you
commit murder?"</p>

<p>"Spare yourself useless prayers;"
said Giacomo, coldly, "this man cares
little for you; this man is not your
father."</p>

<p>"Is not my father?" cried Clemence.</p>

<p>"No, he is not your father, and to-morrow
if he slays me, to-morrow the
family of Lostanges, which holds in its
hands the proofs of this assertion, to-morrow
this family will chase from the
heritage of this man, I will not say the
illegitimate child, but the child which
was purchased in order to plunder the

<!-- page 175 col 1 -->

wealth of his father-in-law, and the
Comtesse D'Auterive, will be recognized
as the daughter of the innkeeper
Vergnes."</p>

<p>"My father! my father!" cried Clemence,
"tell him that he lies."</p>

<p>"It is true;" said Barati, in a tone of
increasing gloom, "but perish thy fortune
and thy name rather than my vengeance!
Listen, Prince of Puzzano!
when D'Auterive informed me that he
was about to visit this province, on account
of the marriage of Bernard de
Velay; when he informed me that the
duke had directed him to submit the
matter to the direction of an unknown
Solitary, who lived concealed in these
ruins, I know not what instinct of hatred
admonished me that you were this man,
for I have not forgotten you for a single
hour: I thought that I should find you
here. To whom else, in truth, than to
the man who has made and unmade his
fortune, could he refer such a decision?
I have come then, and you must know
for what I have undertaken the journey."</p>

<p>"To slay me," said Giacomo, laughing.
"You call that vengeance; I
will teach you a better; I will show you
how to take revenge. Comte D'Auterive,"
cried Pastourel, with a loud voice,
"come forth!"</p>

<p>D'Auterive obeyed; he seemed violently
agitated, and Clemence, whom
the strangeness of the scene had rendered
dumb, was still more astonished,
when, at the bidding of Pastourel, she
beheld her husband appear like a phantom.
Barati also seemed startled at
this apparition.</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive," said Pastourel,
"you now know who I am, and you can
easily imagine my power. Listen carefully
therefore. Your wife, as you have
just heard, is not the daughter of this
man. To avenge himself upon me, he
has not hesitated an instant at the disclosure
of a secret, which would deprive
you of the wealth which he has amassed
by his past venality and his present avarice.
Here then a fortune is escaping
from your grasp. On the other hand,
but a word from me, and you would lose
the inheritance of the baron De la
Roque by the marriage of his daughter

<!-- page 175 col 2 -->

with Bernard de Velay. Well then,
I will insure you the heritage of Barati,
and the heritage of the baron, but
you will at once disarm that wretch,
bind him, drag him hence, and in eight
days, let him be confined in a mad
house upon your testimony and that of
your wife's."</p>

<p>D'Auterive hesitated, and Clemence,
from whose bosom the secret which
had just been revealed to her, had not
entirely effaced her respect and the affection
for one whom she had been accustomed
to consider as her father,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You will not obey, M. D'Auterive!"</p>

<p>Barati thought he was about to triumph,
and raised his pistol, but at that
period this weapon was clumsily made,
and difficult to discharge, and the old
councillor had not yet cocked it, when
D'Auterive, profiting by this act of violence,
to cloak his interposition with an
honorable pretext, wrested the pistol from
the hands of his father-in-law, and said:</p>

<p>"You shall not commit murder!"</p>

<p>Barati, thus disarmed, uttered a cry of
fury:</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, "do you turn
against me? It is well&mdash;it is well! it
is not he who will disclose the secret;
it is I."</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" cried Clemence.</p>

<p>"Beware!" said D'Auterive, in a
gloomy tone.</p>

<p>"I have told you, comte," said Pastourel,
"there is but one way to succeed
with this obstinate old man. He must
leave this hall for the mad house, otherwise
he will ruin you both."</p>

<p>"Clemence! Clemence!" cried Barati,
"if you are not my daughter, yet I
have always treated you with the tenderness
and love of a father."</p>

<p>Madam D'Auterive was agitated by
terrible and contending emotions, and
if she had yielded to the mere impulse
of her heart, it is probable that she
would have interposed to save the old
man without listening to promptings of
self interest, but Pastourel approached
her, and said in a low and hurried
voice:</p>

<p>"If the daughter of Vergnes will not
renounce Barati, the mistress of Bernard
de Velay must do it."</p>

<!-- page 176 col 1 -->

<p>Madam D'Auterive cast a bewildered
glance upon Pastourel, while Barati
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Clemence, you will proclaim the
violence they have done to me; your
word will suffice to confound them,
unless they kill you likewise. You
are the child of my heart, if not of my
blood."</p>

<p>Clemence still hesitated with her
eyes fixed upon Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary," said the latter, "that
I should command where I have deigned
to advise?"</p>

<p>"Clemence!" cried Barati, clasping
his arms about her.</p>

<p>"You are not my father!" exclaimed
Clemence, extricating herself from
his embrace.</p>

<p>As if stricken by lightning Barati
sank upon a seat.</p>

<p>"Here comte," said Pastourel, to
D'Auterive, "here is my dog's chair,
it will serve to bind your father-in-law."</p>

<p>There was so much contempt in the
tone in which Pastourel addressed him,
that D'Auterive felt ashamed at the part
which he was playing, and he replied
with a feeling of pride:</p>

<p>"I was willing to save your life, sir,
but you cannot expect me to aid you in
this infamous act."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Barati, starting up suddenly
with savage joy, "you are deceived
for once, prince of Puzzano, and you
will pay, at last, the penalty of your
crimes."</p>

<p>"You see, the man is mad," said
Pastourel, turning to D'Auterive, "he
looks to you for aid, and he forgets that
if I die without suppressing the proof
of your wife's origin, she is disinherited
as well as you. He is mad, I say; but
for that I should endeavor to make him
understand that he ought to be silent."</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried Barati, rushing furiously
upon Giacomo. Barati's despair
checked D'Auterive. In truth, it was
so odious a deed to lay hands upon a
crushed and desolate old man, that the
comte had shrunk from it, but this new
outbreak banished his hesitation. D'Auterive
rushed upon Barati to arrest him;
a struggle ensued, and when it was over,
Barati lay bound with the dog's chain.</p>

<p>The prince had gazed motionless upon

<!-- page 176 col 2 -->

this scene, but if Barati's cries, and
if the noise of the struggle had not
drowned his voice, he might have been
heard to mutter:</p>

<p>"Oh, the corruption and baseness of
mankind! What an inexhaustible
source of power to him who knows how
to employ them!"</p>

<p>Scarcely was Barati reduced to a
state of helplessness, when a new personage
appeared at the entrance of the
hall.</p>

<p>This personage was Galidou, or the
marquis of Veroni; he paused for a moment
upon the threshold to gaze at the
spectacle before him. Clemence had
taken refuge in a corner of this vast
hall; the comte D'Auterive, who had
been hurried away by the ardour of the
struggle, stood motionless, ashamed of
his victory, as he beheld Barati bound
at his feet; Pastourel was contemplating
his old enemy, not with the joy of a
victor, but with disgust at the victory
which he had gained, and at the means
by which he had attained it.</p>

<p>"Enter, enter, marquis of Veroni!"
said Pastourel. "Be not astonished at
this spectacle; they are prudent children,
and wish to prevent the sad consequences
of their father's madness."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said the marquis, "it is
your father then, my fair comtesse! it is
your father-in-law, my dear comte! it is
Barati! This castle does not bring him
good fortune; this is the second time
that he has set foot in it; the first to be
cast into a dungeon, the second to be
chained like a dog."</p>

<p>"I beg you to believe, marquis," said
D'Auterive, with an air of confusion,
"that we have been forced to this act
of violence. Unfortunately, M. Barati's
reason is failing with age, and he pushes
his extravagance to such a degree that
he does not recognize his own daughter."</p>

<p>While D'Auterive spoke, Barati
slowly raised his head, and gazed at
Veroni with an air of curiosity. Clemence,
ashamed at what had passed,
hastened to say:</p>

<p>"Alas! M. Veroni, my father's madness
is so great that he has made an
attempt upon the life of this venerable
old man."</p>

<p>"It is enough to send you to the gallows,

<!-- page 177 col 1 -->

old maniac!" cried Veroni, with
that rude and careless tone which he
mistook for lordliness. "What the
d&mdash;&mdash;l have you against this venerable
old man, as the fair comtesse calls him?
You are not acquainted with each other
that I know of?"</p>

<p>"I know him, as I know you, Galidou,"
said Barati.</p>

<p>The new marquis started at this name,
and cried in a boisterous tone:</p>

<p>"What? what is that? Galidou!"</p>

<p>"It is you! you!" said Barati.</p>

<p>"Compel your good father to keep
silence, fair comtesse. I see plainly that
he is mad, thoroughly mad!"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Pastourel, in a grave
tone; "let him speak."</p>

<p>All gazed at the speaker in surprise,
and he added:</p>

<p>"It is well that all present should be
convinced of his madness. Speak, Barati,
speak! did you not say that you
recognized this man?"</p>

<p>"Was I wrong in giving him the
name which he bore, when he entered
this castle with me for the first time?"</p>

<p>"No, Barati," said Pastourel "you
were right."</p>

<p>"How, sir?" cried Veroni.</p>

<p>"And now," added Barati, "when I
hear him styled Marquis of Veroni; am
I wrong in recognizing him as the
child of that crime for which I am here
to punish you?"</p>

<p>"No, you are not wrong, Barati; it
is he, whom, forty years ago, you sent
to Vergnes, and whom I carried thence."</p>

<p>"And you have given him the title of
marquis of Veroni?"</p>

<p>"You have heard."</p>

<p>"And you have acknowledged him as
your son?" rejoined Barati.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pastourel; "he whom
you cast from your house, as unworthy
to bear the name of Barati, will at my
death be prince of Puzzano."</p>

<p>At these words Barati laughed scornfully,
and replied:</p>

<p>"Unless your death occurs on the
instant, he will neither be prince of Puzzano
nor marquis of Veroni."</p>

<p>Giacomo seemed agitated at these
words, and Galidou exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What mean you, wretch?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Barati, "when you obtained

<!-- page 177 col 2 -->

that secret restoration to your
rights, a restoration that was granted
upon the condition that no complaint
should be entered against you, for
crimes posterior to that for which you
were condemned at Naples; you imagined
that old Barati, buried in an obscure
corner of Paris, could not hear of your
wild claims; you imagined that he would
not hear that you had caused to be recognized
as your son, him, whom you
snatched from the misery to which I
destined him. You were deceived,
Giacomo, you were deceived! You
have told me that, if you fall by my
hand, a suit would be entered against
this woman, to prove that she is the
daughter of Vergnes, and I tell you that
if you do not fall, you will be called to
an account for having plied the trades
of corsair and of counterfeiter, and be
compelled to prove that this child is
not a suppositious one.</p>

<p>"You are silent, Giacomo;" continued
Barati, "you are all silent. You
see, marquis of Veroni, I am not so
mad as they say. Do you think, Giacomo,
that I am so imprudent as to come
in search of you, without having taken
due precautions? In the strife between
us you have vanquished me too often;
I have learned not to trust to my own
strength! Yes, yes," continued Barati,
with increasing ardor, "I have come
to slay you, and I would give my life; I
would sacrifice the fortune of this woman,
whom I have loved as a daughter,
to hold you, trembling and prostrate,
beneath my knee, as you once held me.
But I have anticipated what has happened;
I foresaw that some hellish trick
might give you, perhaps, the advantage
over me, and I have taken my precautions.&mdash;Ah,
ha! you jest no longer
prince of Puzzano! you brave me no
longer; you said a moment since, 'I
will show you how to take revenge.'
It is now my turn&mdash;marquis of Veroni,
let this man die upon the instant, and
you shall be prince of Puzzano."</p>

<p>Galidou had hearkened with drooping
head and clenched hands. Pastourel
had listened to the ex-councillor, as it
were, in the features of his son: it
seemed as if Barati's words could only
touch him by the effect which they

<!-- page 178 col 1 -->

produced upon the marquis; he looked
for some gesture of indignation, some
cry of affection, which should repel the
fearful proposition. A livid paleness
spread itself over Pastourel's features,
and he said, with a faltering voice to
D'Auterive, who as well as Clemence,
had listened with an air of extreme
anxiety:</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive, I have told you
the result which would follow from my
death, to your wife and you."</p>

<p>"Marquis of Veroni," said Barati,
"you will return to tend your sheep if
he outlives this hour!"</p>

<p>Pastourel quietly took his seat upon
the bed, leaned his elbows upon the table,
covered his face with his hands, as
if he wished to remain a stranger to
what was passing.</p>

<p>Barati appeared to imitate him; he
settled himself in the chair to which he
had been raised, and gazed at his son-in-law
and at the son of Pastourel,
watching them with extreme disquietude
and distrust. This silence lasted
for some moments. At last, D'Auterive
made a sign to Galidou, and the latter
approached Barati, and said:</p>

<p>"Come, let us arrange matters, worthy
councillor; we are old friends; you
will prevent this complaint against my
father and myself, and at my entreaty
he will arrange matters with the family
of Lostanges."</p>

<p>"That woman is not my daughter,"
replied Barati. "There is but one
means to save yourself; it is to slay this
man."</p>

<p>During this while, D'Auterive, who
was sitting near Pastourel, said to him:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you can harbor no
enmity against myself and Clemence,
you will not deprive us of all our hopes."</p>

<p>"There is but one way to avert this
misfortune," replied Pastourel: "it is
to confine your  father-in-law in a mad
house."</p>

<p>"How!" rejoined Galidou; "you
will yield nothing, my dear councillor?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" answered Barati.</p>

<p>"Is there no way of arranging matters,
Monseigneur," said D'Auterive, in
his turn.</p>

<p>"None!" answered Pastourel.</p>

<!-- page 178 col 2 -->

<p>"But have you no pity for any one,"
said Galidou.</p>

<p>"Slay this man," said Barati, "and
I will give you my fortune, in addition
to that which will then be yours."</p>

<p>"You had more generosity formerly,"
said D'Auterive to Pastourel.</p>

<p>"I wish to see your father-in-law die
in a mad-house. Do as I have told you,
and I will render you tenfold richer than
you expect to be."</p>

<p>Each one had spoken apart, and at
the moment when the two old men offered
their conditions&mdash;the one to the
son, the other to the son-in-law of his
enemy&mdash;the latter glanced each at his
destined victim, and their eyes met.
Clemence, who had watched this double
scene, comprehended this double glance,
and as if seized by a sudden horror, she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why slay them? We should not
the less be lost."</p>

<p>Neither Galidou nor D'Auterive replied,
however. Giacomo's son was
pale as ashes; he trembled in every
limb; he stooped toward Barati's ear,
and said:</p>

<p>"Send away your son-in-law; he
would defend him."</p>

<p>"I abandon him to you," replied Barati.
"Slay him first."</p>

<p>"Can you sacrifice your son to your
vengeance?" said D'Auterive, in a low
voice to Pastourel "If so, what is
rank and title to you in this solitude.
Abandon him to me, and I will give up
Barati."</p>

<p>"Begone!" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>Galidou and D'Auterive rose together,
and stood face to face. By an involuntary
movement, the former had placed
his hand upon his sword; D'Auterive
partly drew his own. They paused,
and measured each other with a glance.
Clemence threw herself between them.
A frightful silence reigned for a moment
in this gloomy hall.</p>

<p>Barati, who watched them with a
smile of savage joy, suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Courage! courage! Marquis of Veroni;
avenge me!"</p>

<p>Pastourel rose, and approaching
Barati, said, with a calm voice:

<!-- page 179 col 1 -->

<p>"You are sufficiently avenged, Barati!"</p>

<p>He then unfastened the chain with
which D'Auterive had bound his arms,
and after he had restored him to the use
of his limbs, he said:</p>

<p>"You can slay me now, Barati; you
have just taken from me the last hope
which bound me to this world."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Barati, "you love him
then&mdash;this son! Well, Pastourel, since
you love him, I will let you live, and I
will even suffer you to make him Prince
of Puzzano."</p>

<p>"As I suffer you," rejoined Pastourel,
"to preserve your heritage for the
devoted son-in-law and the grateful
daughter, who have so well protected
you."</p>

<p>"I have neither daughter nor son-in-law
more," said Barati.</p>

<p>"And I have no longer a son," said
Pastourel. "Begone, all of you."</p>

<p>"One moment! one moment!" cried
Galidou. "You shall not escape in this
manner, M. Barati, and you shall not
drive me away thus, Monseigneur, my
father."</p>

<p>"What do you venture to claim?"
cried Pastourel.</p>

<p>"How! what do I venture to claim?
Why, nothing but what is just, I think.
Ah, ha! do you think the matter is to
end thus? You are&mdash;by all the devils,
truth is truth&mdash;you are two old scoundrels!"</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Prince," said D'Auterive, angrily,
"the terms which he uses are harsh,
perhaps, but he is right."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I am right. You seduced
a young maiden, you, who call me a
wretch, and you forsake her so that she
is forced to wed another, and when the
husband who cannot be greatly blamed
for that, wishes to send me, your son, to
a hospital, or I know not where, you, in
your paternal tenderness, pass me off as
the child of a beggar, and you rear me
up as a shepherd. Then the day comes
when you persuade me to burn down
the castle of La Roque, and as a reward
you promise to make me Marquis of
Veroni; I am so, and it is all well; but
if I cease to be a marquis to-morrow, it
is much worse than if I had never been

<!-- page 179 col 2 -->

one; better have left me in the street:
the first one who picked me up would
have shown more tenderness."</p>

<p>"He is right," cried Barati; "your
son is right, Giacomo."</p>

<p>"Be silent! robber of inheritances!"
exclaimed Galidou, growing more and
more exasperated as he continued. "Do
you think I do not know how you treated
my poor mother? Do you think I
do not know to what despair you reduced
her, miserable wretch that you are?
And here you are, to-day, both of you,
making and unmaking our fortunes, as
if we were puppets to be played with, and
to be dressed up as princes or beggars
to suit your whims! No, by all the
fiends, it shall not be so! and I warn you
that neither the one nor the other shall
leave this hall, until you have arranged
matters."</p>

<p>"You should know, unhappy child,"
replied Pastourel, "that no one can
leave this hall without my permission;
shake, if you can, that door, which you
opened so easily on entering; call from
the enclosure of these walls, whence no
one will hear your cries. And now, we
will remain together. You are armed,
gentlemen, and so am I likewise. Would
you essay the combat? Begin it, and
in a few days hunger will avenge the
vanquished upon the victor."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Galidou, in a
threatening tone, "Open this door!"</p>

<p>"When you acknowledge that you
are in my power," said Pastourel&mdash;"when
you have asked pardon of me
upon your knees."</p>

<p>"But, Monseigneur," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"You have heard," said Giacomo,
"this is the hour when I usually sleep.
Adieu!"</p>

<p>He approached his bed, then threw
himself upon it, and cried:</p>

<p>"Greyfoot!"</p>

<p>The dog leaped up.</p>

"I am going to sleep. Watch, Greyfoot,
watch!"</p>

<p>The dog took his post at the bedside,
casting angry glances at the remaining
actors in the scene.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Barati had stooped
and picked up the pistol which D'Auterive
had wrested from him. He cocked

<!-- page 180 col 1 -->

it, but at the moment when he directed
it toward the bed, the lamp was suddenly
extinguished, a fearful and ominous
noise was heard, the walls appeared to
shake, and then profound silence and
deep darkness reigned in the hall.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

<p class="small">THE BAFFLED FLIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> these strange events were passing
in the ruins, occurrences of great interest
were in progress at the castle of
La Roque. We left Bernard at the
moment when, having overheard the project
of Charlotte's flight with Vasconcellos
or Don Jos&eacute;, he had resolved to find
the baron, and give him warning of it.
The latter was already awaiting him.
He heard Bernard's hurried steps, the
violence with which he threw open the
doors, without waiting to be announced,
and he felt assured that the young lover
was the bearer of unpleasant news.
The old man smiled at the thought.
Bernard entered, and took a seat near
him.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said M. De la Roque,
impatient to hear the tidings, "how do
matters stand? Have you discovered
anything that throws light upon our suspicions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, baron," said Bernard, "and
my doubts are entirely removed. I am
sure now that my fears are well founded.
Charlotte is deceiving us."</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay," said the baron,
"that is a serious charge. What proof
have you?"</p>

<p>"I foresaw," said Bernard, "that your
paternal tenderness, at first so anxious
to learn the truth, would hesitate to believe
it when it was told you."</p>

<p>"Marquis de Velay, I may be permitted
perhaps to feel a doubt where
you feel a certainty. Alas! you lose
but a single hope, but a single illusion
of the many which cheer your youth,
whilst I am robbed of the only one
which remains to me; and, besides, sir,
before a father condemns his daughter,
he should have irrefragable proofs, and
who can say that you do not magnify

<!-- page 180 col 2 -->

some trifling act of imprudence to a
grave offence."</p>

<p>Bernard had not forgotten that it was
the baron himself who had excited his
suspicions, but he attributed this change
in the old man's views to a caprice of
paternal affection, affection which is
sometimes so severe, sometimes so indulgent,
and he replied:</p>

<p>"I regret what I have told you, baron,
but I was unwilling to break my promise."</p>

<p>"Well, well," rejoined the baron, "I
see how it is; your jealousy has magnified
matters; you have been alarmed
at some chance meeting, some familiar
words."</p>

<p>This remark uttered with an air of
disdain, produced the effect which the
baron expected, and Bernard exclaimed
hastily:</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> I know not what name you
will give to a project of elopement or
abduction, but at midnight this Vasconcellos
is to wait for your daughter at the
garden gate, and at break of day they
will have crossed the frontiers. I would
have spared you these cruel tidings, but
I had promised to tell you all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At midnight then," cried the baron,
interrupting him, "at the little gate of
the park&mdash;I will be there, marquis, I will
be there."</p>

<p>"But this injury is mine as well as
yours."</p>

<p>"You have no right to avenge it,
sir," said the baron,, "none&mdash;do you
hear? it is I&mdash;I&mdash;who must punish, and
will punish the guilty ones."</p>

<p>"But, sir, I have a right, I think, to
give this M. Vasconcellos the lesson
that he has merited."</p>

<p>"By and by, sir," said the baron, "by
and by; when the father is once satisfied,
it will be the lover's turn."</p>

<p>As Bernard was about to remonstrate,
M. De la Roque continued, in a more
peremptory tone:</p>

<p>"It must be as I have decided, sir;
besides you need not be alarmed," he
added, "if you are bent upon avenging
this injury, I will leave place for your
vengeance."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt it?" said the marquis.</p>

<p>"We shall see, sir."</p>

<p>We will not relate the rest of this

<!-- page 181 col 1 -->

interview; suffice it to say that the
baron and Bernard, accompanied by
Pierre and Jean Couteau, with three or
four domestics well armed, concealed
themselves in a small thicket, a few
paces distant from the garden gate.</p>

<p>With the exception of the baron and
Bernard all were ignorant of the object
of their ambuscade. M. De la Roque
directed them to keep, perfectly silent,
and told them that when the proper moment
came, he would give his orders.</p>

<p>A few minutes before midnight, a
man on horseback, leading a second by
the bridle, rode up to the little gate
which was soon opened, and a female
came from the garden.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Charlotte?" said Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I. Let us hasten, for
Bernard was here this evening, and had
a long interview with my father, and to-morrow
perhaps, I could not accompany
you."</p>

<p>At this moment the baron cried out:
"Seize them! seize them!" and all
rushed upon Don Jos&eacute;, and threw him
to the ground; at the baron's orders his
daughter as well as Frias, was carried
back to the castle, and the old man,
grasping Bernard by the arm, cried:</p>

<p>"At last I hold my vengeance in my
hands!"</p>

<p>These words were uttered with such
an accept of savage joy, that the young
man started. He even feared one of
those sanguinary acts of which the
baron, as was said, had been guilty in
past times, and he resolved to prevent it.
He declared this resolution to the baron,
who merely replied:</p>

<p>"I will be more just and moderate
than you expect, Bernard. Who knows
if you will not find my dealings with
the culprits too lenient?"</p>

<p>These words, which apparently announced
a calm, and equitable purpose,
were uttered, however, with such a
thrill of cruel pleasure that they were
far from reassuring Bernard, and his
fears were redoubled when he heard the
baron order his servants to conduct Vasconcellos
to the most retired apartment
of the building, and to confine Charlotte
in her chamber.</p>

<p>"Do you intend," said the Marquis,
"to keep this Vasconcellos prisoner? or

<!-- page 181 col 2 -->

do you meditate some attempt against
his life?"</p>

<p>"You will see what I intend, for you
will follow me, Marquis de Velay,
and you, Jean Couteau, and you also,"
he said, turning to his domestics. "But
as I wish to satisfy you as to my intentions,
marquis, I have sent for the criminal
judge of the bailiwick and his clerk&mdash;No,
Marquis de Velay, there will
be no violence, no bloodshed&mdash;you will
see."</p>

<p>As the baron had previously warned
the judge to be in readiness, in the
course of an hour he reached the castle,
accompanied by his clerk. In the interval
Bernard essayed every means to
penetrate the baron's designs, but the
latter made him no reply, except these
words:</p>

<p>"Believe me, believe me, my vengeance
will be cruel, but there will be
room for yours."</p>

<p>The judge entered, and the baron,
followed by all who had been present
at the arrest of the fugitives, repaired
to the apartment in which Don Josi
was confined. At the same time he
gave orders that Charlotte should be
brought in, and when she appeared, he
took his seat, and ordered his domestics
to range themselves around the chamber.
He requested Bernard to sit hear
him; he desired a chair to be brought
for the judge, a table and writing materials
for the clerk, and then summoned
Vasconcellos and Charlotte to advance
to the middle of the chamber, as if they
had been in presence of a tribunal. He
then began in a tone of great dignity
and calmness:</p>

<p>"Worthy judge, I have requested
your presence here to receive an accusation.
I present it before all persons
here assembled, in order that they may
confirm the truth, if my grief should
cause me to distort it."</p>

<p>"Speak, sir!" replied the judge.</p>

<p>"It is more than three months
since this man, who has come to reside
in this country under the name of Vasconcellos,
presented himself at my
house."</p>

<p>"Is this true, sir?" said the judge.</p>

<p>"It is true," replied Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<!-- page 182 col 1 -->

<p>"Write," said the judge, turning to
the clerk.</p>

<p>"I know not for what cause," continued
the baron, "this man has since that
time avoided my presence, for the reception
which I gave him, was such as
one gives to a neighbor of good birth.
I imagined that the society of a blind
old man had little charms for him, and
I had almost forgotten him, when I was
informed that he took advantage of my
hours of repose to pay frequent visits to
my daughter."</p>

<p>"Is this true?" said the judge, turning
to Vasconcellos.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated; but, confronted
as he was by the domestics, all of whom
could testify to the fact, he durst not deny
it, and he answered:</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>"Write!" said the judge.</p>

<p>Don Jos&eacute; cast a glance upon Charlotte,
who could scarcely repress her
shame and indignation.</p>

<p>"I have no need, sir, to tell you the
purpose of these visits; the result will
show this sufficiently."</p>

<p>The baron paused, as if choked with
grief at the crime which he was about
to disclose.</p>

<p>"On this very day, sir, this man agreed
to meet my daughter at the ruins of La
Roque, at the old sorcerer's who inhabits
them; and during this interview, assisted
by the juggleries of that wretch,
he has completely robbed my child of
her senses, for a project of elopement
was arranged between them; this project
they have attempted to put in execution,
and at this hour they would be
beyond the reach of my justice, or of
yours, rather, if I had not watched their
movements, and prevented their flight
at the moment when the treacherous
seducer led his horses to the little gate
of my garden; these horses I have detained,
and they belong to this Vasconcellos;
the words uttered by my daughter
leave no doubt as to their design,
and I have kept this man a prisoner in
order to deliver him up to your justice,
as the betrayer of my daughter."</p>

<p>The judge repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Is it true, sir?"</p>

<p>"Appearances are against me," said
Don Jos&eacute;, "but I am not, I cannot be

<!-- page 182 col 2 -->

the betrayer of Mademoiselle De la
Roque."</p>

<p>"Have I deviated from the facts in
any point?" said the baron, looking
around him.</p>

<p>The testimony of all present was
unanimous in confirming the truth of
the old Seigneur's words, and the judge
directed the clerk to write down this
evidence also; he then said:</p>

<p>"And now, baron De la Roque, what
do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>The baron covered his face with his
hands; like a man overwhelmed with
the deepest affliction, and kept silence
for a moment. Then, with the air of
one who has subdued himself by a great
effort of generosity, he replied:</p>

<p>"Alas, sir! the first impulse of my
heart was a desire for vengeance, but a
father's tenderness has resumed its
sway. Yes, yes, I know that I can severely
punish him who has brought affliction
and dishonor into my family;
I know that I can confine in a convent
the daughter who has cast a stain upon
her name. But it would break my
heart to chastise the child, whom I
have loved so well, and whom I still
love, notwithstanding her guilt!"</p>

<p>This paroxysm of sensibility astonished
all present, and affected even the
judge himself; the baron continued in
a voice rendered almost inarticulate
from emotion:</p>

<p>"Let this man make my daughter
the reparation which he owes her; let
him espouse her, and I can still pardon
them."</p>

<p>This method of obtaining vengeance
was by no means pleasing to Bernard,
who found that he had favored his rival,
in seeking to avenge himself, but it fell
like a thunderbolt upon Don Jos&eacute; and
Charlotte, who gazed upon each other
in dismay, while the judge exclaimed
with emotion:</p>

<p>"Fall at your father's feet. Mademoiselle,
and implore his forgiveness;
and you, sir, thank the baron De la
Roque for the honor which he does you,
and which you are far from deserving.
You will espouse her whom you have
led astray."</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Charlotte, with horror,

<!-- page 183 col 1 -->

"espouse this man! it is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the judge.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" replied Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Ha! is it so, then?" cried Bernard,
who imagined that he had found an opportunity
for interfering in the affair.
"Well, then, M. Vasconcellos, you will
account to me for your infamous conduct."</p>

<p>"I do not recognize your right to
meddle in the affair," said Don Jos&eacute;,
proudly, "but if it suits you, I am very
ready to give you a lesson in prudence
and politeness."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Judge, interposing
with an air of authority, "we
have nothing to do here either with duels
or points of honor. I have received
an accusation from the Baron de la
Roque; this accusation is justified by
acknowledged and flagrant acts; the
baron offers you an honorable means of
arranging matters; this means you refuse?"</p>

<p>Charlotte and Don Jos&eacute;, prompted by
the same emotion, replied with one
voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"Well then," said the judge, "the
law must act now. You, sir, will be
taken to the prison of Foix. Your position
as a foreigner renders this necessary;
you must not be permitted to
escape after your crime&mdash;you, who have
neither fortune nor family in this country
to be security for you. As to you,
Mademoiselle, if it please your father
to keep you in his house, he can do so;
but if he is unwilling to consent to this
arrangement, I think it best that you
should be taken hence to the convent
of St. Benoit, where you will remain
until the issue of this trial."</p>

<p>Vasconcellos was stupefied, but Charlotte
gazing upon the judge with a loftiness
that displayed all the resolution
of her character, replied in a tone of
scorn:</p>

<p>"A word will suffice to disprove this
accusation, and baffle all your projects
of severity and imprisonment;
know then, sir, since I am compelled to
speak before these witnesses, know
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 183 col 2 -->

<p>"Silence! silence!" cried Vasconcellos;
"you forget <i>another</i>."</p>

<p>Charlotte answered to this interruption
by a gesture of indignation, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But I will not be disgraced, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" rejoined Vasconcellos,
"all is not lost!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the baron, "relieve me
from this distressing scene. Take away
this man&mdash;conduct my daughter to a
convent&mdash;Go, go!"</p>

<p>"But sir," exclaimed Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the baron, sinking back
upon his chair, "the unhappy child
would kill me then!"</p>

<p>The judge moved by this excess of
despair, directed Vasconcellos to be led
away, who submitted, saying to Bernard:</p>

<p>"I am very ready to entertain you,
Marquis de Velay."</p>

<p>"When you please," replied the latter.</p>

<p>Charlotte strongly protested against
the violence to which she was subjected,
but Jean Couteau, who had grasped her
by the arms, said to her in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I know how matters stand, Mademoiselle.
Be calm; I will make the
baron listen to reason."</p>

<p>All retired, leaving M. de la Roque
and the old hunter alone.</p>

<p>The door of the hall was scarcely
closed, when the baron, who heard the
heavy steps of Jean Couteau approaching
him, said in a rough tone:</p>

<p>"I know all, Jean Couteau, I know
all; she is not my daughter; Don Jos&eacute;
is her father, she has not been betrayed;
I know all. Spare your words, but I
am avenged!"</p>

<p>"What do you purpose then, my
lord?" said Jean Couteau in alarm.</p>

<p>"What do I purpose? Ha!" said the
baron, striking his hands together, "fifteen
years of delay are not too long to
wait for the vengeance which I purpose."</p>

<p>"But this marriage is impossible, as
you well know."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" rejoined the baron,
"impossible! Ha! let them keep silence&mdash;Don
Jos&eacute;, condemned as the seducer
of a maiden of noble family&mdash;Don
Jos&eacute;, disguised under a false name, will
be sentenced to the galleys&mdash;to the galleys!
do you hear? and his daughter

<!-- page 184 col 1 -->

will end her days in a prison for abandoned
women."</p>

<p>"But if they speak?"</p>

<p>"Ha! then," said the baron, "Don
Jos&eacute; is guilty of adultery, and the accusation
will reach to his accomplice Paula,
in the convent where she has feigned
to take refuge against my brutal tyranny.
Ha! the devout Paula will leave the
house of God to take her place upon the
bench of the criminal. And Charlotte,
branded as the child of guilt, will henceforth
have neither name nor fortune&mdash;nothing!
Ah, ha!" added the old seigneur,
rising, and stretching his clenched
hands towards heaven, "let them speak,
or let them be silent&mdash; it matters little;
I am avenged!"</p>

<p>Couteau gazed upon him for some
time, terrified at the delirium of his ferocious
joy, then, knowing that all persuasion
would be lost upon his master,
he retired, muttering:</p>

<p>"There is but one man who can save
them, and that man is Pastourel."</p>

<p>He at once left the castle, and forgetting
his superstitious fears, bent his steps
toward the ruins.</p>

<p>He was too familiar with the localities
of the old mansion to find any difficulty
in discovering the hall, which, from
the description of his daughter-in-law,
was occupied by Pastourel. He advanced
at once toward the door, but
upon reaching it, he heard a sound that
chilled his very soul with terror. Cries,
oaths, word of fury or complaint, echoed
upon the ears of poor Jean Couteau.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he cried, falling powerless
upon his knees, "this is the hour when
he conjures up his evil spirits. Heaven
chastises me for my presumption!"</p>

<p>The poor man had not the strength to
rise and flee, and he began to pray,
mingling with his prayers all the formulas
of exorcism with which he was acquainted.
Although this by no means
quieted the infernal din which resounded
in the hall, it gave him time to listen
to it more carefully and to distinguish
some of its sounds. By degrees, these
demoniacal cries put on a strange resemblance
to the voices of men, interrupted
now and then by that of a woman.
Among these voices he fancied

<!-- page 184 col 2 -->

that he could recognize Galidou's, and
at last, he could hear what he said:</p>

<p>"The devil take it!" cried Galidou;
"where are you, Comte D'Auterive?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Come this way; let us find the
door."</p>

<p>"Come yourself; I cannot tell into
what trap a man may set his foot in this
accursed hall."</p>

<p>"Oh, the old wretch!" cried Galidou,
"yet I should have known enough of
his tricks to foresee that he would baffle
us."</p>

<p>"Clemence! Clemence!" said D'Auterive,
"I do not hear you."</p>

<p>"I dare not stir, sir!"</p>

<p>"If I only knew where the door was&mdash;let
him say it will open only at his
will, I will break my fists to pieces, or
dash it down!"</p>

<p>All this bore no resemblance to a gathering
of evil spirits, but to the confused
sounds of men taken in a snare,
and these men called each other by
names which were known to Couteau.
He hesitated for a long time, fearful of
being duped by some diabolical machination,
and besides this, he was afraid
to meddle with the projects of Pastourel.</p>

<p>"But still," he said to himself, "if I
have acted sinfully in coming to demand
aid from a sorcerer, I will repair my
fault by saving those whom he wishes
to destroy."</p>

<p>As soon as he had arrived at this conclusion,
he commenced knocking against
the door, crying:</p>

<p>"Who is within?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there is a human voice," said
Comte D'Auterive; "let us listen."</p>

<p>Jean Couteau repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Ha! it is Father Couteau!" replied
Galidou, in a joyous and familiar voice,
that a demon could hardly have imitated.
"It is we," he replied, stepping
carefully toward the door: "it is I, the
Marquis of Veroni, the Comte and Comtesse
D'Auterive, with her father. Pastourel
has shut us up here to play some
infernal trick. Open the door, Father
Couteau!"</p>

<p>The latter, now reassured, endeavored
to find a key, a lock, a bolt, but he
discovered nothing of the kind; he pushed

<!-- page 185 col 1 -->

against the door, but he might as
well have pushed against a wall.</p>

<p>"It is of no use," he replied, "the
door seems set in the wall."</p>

<p>"So, so! does he expect to keep us
to perish here with hunger?" said Galidou.
"Well, then, Jean Couteau, if
you cannot open it, break it down."</p>

<p>Couteau looked about for a large stone,
and began to beat against the door with
all his strength, but without making the
slightest impression upon it.</p>

<p>"It would take a battering ram to
break it down," he said. "I do not
know what to do."</p>

<p>"Well, then," cried Barati, "go and
bring help."</p>

<p>Before Couteau could reply, Galidou's
voice arrested him:</p>

<p>"One moment! one moment!" he
cried. "If Father Couteau leaves us,
heaven only knows what this accursed
sorcerer will do to us. Do not forget,
Father Couteau, that if any harm
happens to me, or to Comte D'Auterive,
or to his wife, or Father Barati, do not
forget, I say, to testify that it is the result
of the juggleries of Pastourel, or
rather, remember this, of Giacomo
Spaffa, Prince of Puzzano."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Jean Couteau.</p>

<p>"You are accusing your father," said
Barati.</p>

<p>"He is not my father," said Galidou;
"he is the devil, or one of his instruments.
I do not know how it can
serve him, but he has used me like
an idiot, to make me play the part of
marquis for some end or other. Jean
Couteau, I am Galidou, neither more
nor less; I like that better than all the
marquisates in the world, that come
from hell."</p>

<p>"Go, go, Father Couteau," said
Comte D'Auterive, "and bring some
one with you to bear evidence as to the
state in which you find us, whether
living or dead."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" said Jean Couteau, "I
shall perhaps find the criminal judge at
the Baron de la Roque's, and he will
be the best witness that I could bring
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Barati, "bring
him, and we will see then if all his traps
will save the wretch who has confined

<!-- page 185 col 2 -->

us here, from the gallows or from the
stake which he has so well deserved."</p>

<p>While occupied by this adventure, Jean
Couteau had entirely forgotten the motive
which had led him to the ruins, but
when he spoke of returning to the castle,
and of the criminal judge, he recalled
to mind that he had come hither
to implore aid of the very man whom
he was now about to deprive of his prisoners,
and he said aloud:</p>

<p>"But all this will not save the others.
Well, God is powerful, and He will preserve
them all, if such is His will and
purpose."</p>

<p>"Who is in danger then?" said a
voice at his side, at the sound of which
the poor man fell with his face to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, Jean Couteau, have no
fear!" said Pastourel; "he who serves
God with a grateful heart is safe from all
peril, were he in the presence of Satan,
and he who is near you, is a servant of
God and a friend."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it you, Pastourel?" said
Jean Couteau. "Oh, I have never done
you any harm&mdash;have compassion on my
soul!"</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Jean Couteau;
you will clasp the hand of a man, and
not of a demon: rise, my old comrade,
in whom there dwells more honor than
in all those wretches who are confined
in this hall."</p>

<p>By a remnant of that submission
which had always influenced Jean
Couteau, he obeyed, and Pastourel,
leading him from the door, conducted
him into the middle of the old court,
and said to him:</p>

<p>"It was here, Jean, that you saved
Galidou from the savage anger of the
baron, and here I swear to grant the
request which you have come to demand
of me. Look at me well, Couteau!
I take God to witness, I raise
my hand toward heaven, and you see
that it does not tremble; I am a Christian
like yourself, my poor Couteau. Come,
then, tell me what has brought you to
these ruins!"</p>

<p>Jean Couteau, somewhat encouraged
by Pastourel's asseverations, now described
the scenes which had passed at
the baron's mansion, and the frightful

<!-- page 186 col 1 -->

position in which he had placed Charlotte
and Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"You know the secret of all things,"
added Jean Couteau, "have you no
means to save them?"</p>

<p>Pastourel reflected for a moment, and
then said:</p>

<p>"If it were merely Charlotte and
Don Jos&eacute;, they are scarcely worth a
thought, but there lives a poor woman
who would be crushed in the shock of
these fearful passions, and her I would
gladly save. Return home, Jean, I will
watch over them; and may God set the
good which I would do against the evil
which I have committed."</p>

<p>"Do you speak truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Pastourel, in a sad
tone.</p>

<p>"Persevere, persevere, Pastourel!"
replied Couteau with enthusiasm, "see,
Pastourel! with all one's power, with
all one's skill, there is hope and safety
in God alone; he alone will never fail
us!"</p>

<p>"You are right, Jean," said Pastourel,
in a tone of profound dejection, "you
are right! we can call nothing ours in
this world; all fail us, even the affections
of our children."</p>

<p>"But what has the <i>fillou</i> done then?"
said Jean Couteau; "what has he done
that you have shut him up with the
rest?"</p>

<p>"Did you not hear him renounce
me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>," said Jean, "he is not a
true son&mdash;see you! he is not a son like
mine."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Jean?"</p>

<p>"Sir, Pastourel," replied the old man,
in a humble tone, "the child to whom
one cannot say, with a lifted hand, 'I
am your father; you bear my name as
well as my blood; and you owe me
reverence because I have never failed in
my duty towards you'&mdash;this child will
be presumptuous and ungrateful; it is
the judgment of heaven; it is a punishment
for past offences."</p>

<p>"Where, then, Oh God! hast thou
bestowed sense and wisdom," said Pastourel,
"that this lesson comes to me
from this man? You are right, Couteau;
go and release him, together with
those who are confined with him; but

<!-- page 186 col 2 -->

say nothing of our meeting. I will
hence and see to the safety of the
others."</p>

<p>Pastourel pointed out to Couteau the
secret spring which opened the door of
the hall. He concealed himself amid
the ruins, and heard Galidou exclaim:</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! the Judge is still at the
Baron's! let us go; it is time to rid the
country of this sorcerer."</p>

<p>Pastourel turned his back upon the
ruins, and took the road to the Convent
of St. Benoit. The others, followed by
Couteau, bent their steps to the abode
of the Baron de la Roque.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE CONVENT.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will not follow D'Auterive and
his wife, Galidou and Barati, on their
way to the Baron's mansion; neither
will we accompany Pastourel, but will
at once enter the Convent of St. Benoit.
It was situated in one of the deep sinuosities
of the mountain, in a delightful
valley, covered with shade and with the
richest verdure. At every step, swollen
rivulets, speeding onward to leap into
the distant ravines, to feed some
muddy and devastating torrent, flowed,
clear and limpid, amid the tufted herbage,
amid soft and gentle undulations,
lending, at each moment, variety to the
aspect of this close-environed valley,
which had but one issue, and this by a
narrow pass, that was completely occupied
by the monastery.</p>

<p>The convent, which thus shut in the
valley, was built upon a succession of
low arches, that gave passage to its
waters; and while the one side looked
upon the bottom of a verdant and lovely
glen, the other leaned over a vast and
rocky wall, which descended perpendicularly
to the bed of a mighty torrent.
It was said by the country people that
this convent, when seen from the plain
below, appeared like a window in the
mountain.</p>

<p>The delightful path which led thither,
was well adapted to inspire mild and
pleasant thoughts; it seemed impossible

<!-- page 187 col 1 -->

that suffering souls could inhabit this
lonely Eden, and if ever the aspect of a
convent was enticing, it was here. But
alas! like almost everything which
wears a charming exterior in this world,
within, it did not correspond with the
scene which surrounded it. The walls
of the monastery once passed, a large
and barren court-yard met the eye. The
earth was trampled down, and bare of
verdure. At the left of the court was
the vegetable garden, well tilled and cultivated
doubtless, but its insipid regularity
formed a striking contrast to the rich
vegetation without the walls.</p>

<p>A few sickly trees, whose fruits did
not ripen at this elevation, cast a feeble
shade upon the white soil of the walks.
On the right hand were the <i>communes</i>,
the wash-house, the dispensary, all coated
with lime, and shining with hard and
uniform neatness, varied neither by the
dark green lichen nor by a tuft of yellow
moss. Every window was furnished
with thick iron bars and a close
grating; lastly, in front stood the main
building, enclosing the chapel, the refectory,
the cells, and above, the apartments
of the Superior and the dormitories.</p>

<p>At the hour at which we enter it, the
chapel is lighted; from eight to ten nuns
are here upon their knees, in prayer;
while another, standing erect near the
rope of the chapel bell, tolls from time
to time a melancholy knell, which leaps
from echo to echo up the valley, while,
on the side of the plain, it seems to fly
and lose itself in space.</p>

<p>The nuns, kneeling upon the marble
pavement, with their hands crossed upon
their breasts, are motionless as statues,
and naught is heard but the low and
monotonous murmur of their voices.
Suddenly a woman of lofty stature, with
pallid face and features wan with fasting,
but with a haughty brow, and eyes still
animated with a vivid fire, appeared at
the inner door of the chapel, and said in
a slow and solemn tone:</p>

<p>"Pray, my sisters, our holy mother's
soul is passing!"</p>

<p>The nun who held the rope sounded
the knell anew, and the new comer,
kneeling with the rest, muttered a short
prayer, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, when

<!-- page 187 col 2 -->

another female appeared; she was still
young, but pale and thin like the other,
and her eyes were animated with the
same vivid light.</p>

<p>"Pray, my sisters," she said, "pray!
The death struggle draws near, and no
priest, warned by the knell, comes to receive
our holy mother's confession."</p>

<p>This nun kneeled like the rest, muttered
a short prayer, and retired. She
ascended a dark and wide stairway of
stone, entered a long corridor, and opened
the door of a cell. Upon a wooden
bedstead, which was covered with a
simple mattress, lay a woman dressed in
the coarse woollen garb of a nun. A
large cross of gold, which was suspended
from her neck by a blue ribbon, alone
announced her dignity. The cell was
large, but no tapestry covered the walls;
they were adorned, however, with a few
pictures representing religious subjects.</p>

<p>A long oaken table, with a bench on
either side, a wooden chair and two
stools of the same material, composed
the furniture of this large chamber.
The bedstead faced the door with the
head against the wall. Kneeling in
prayer on one side of the bed, was the
nun who had first entered the chapel;
the second placed herself on the opposite
side, and both rehearsed the prayers for
the dying. The Superior uttered the
responses in a firm voice, with her
hands crossed upon her breast, and her
eyes directed towards heaven, motionless
as if she had been in her coffin.
A single lamp lighted this gloomy scene
with rays, which the wind stealing
through the crevices of the door, threatened
every moment to extinguish as
they cast their changing and fantastic
shadows upon the wall.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed thus, when
the first nun rose, to seek, doubtless, the
sisters in the chapel, and to repeat her
admonition, but the Superior said to her:</p>

<p>"Ah! let them pray for me, sister
Martha; let the knell sound without
ceasing, until a priest arrives to confess
and absolve me."</p>

<p>The nun, whom the Superior thus
addressed, replied:</p>

<p>"Wherefore these tears, my mother?
After the thirty years of penitence
which you have passed within these

<!-- page 188 col 1 -->

walls, you can appear before God without
fear."</p>

<p>"Thirty years of penitence, my
daughter, do not suffice to tear the
demon of temptation from the heart of
the sinner; thirty years of penitence
have not prevented me from feeling a
senseless desire, a desire that augments
with my approaching end, and I know
not if at this hour I would not resign
the safety of my soul, to see for a moment
him whom I have seen but once.
Pray, pray for me, my daughters, my
heart fails in the trial, and the past
which I thought buried forever, rises
before my soul to tempt me."</p>

<p>Sister Martha now left the cell and
reappeared a moment after.</p>

<p>Soon it was the turn of the other sister
to seek the chapel, and when she rose
at the appointed time, the Superior said
to her:</p>

<p>"Pray! pray for me! I regret the
life of penitence which I have passed in
this hallowed house; I would fain have
lived amid the joys of the world.
Pray for me! Have I not wept and
prayed enough, oh God! enough to
stifle in this breast every passion which
is not dedicated to thee, every regret
but that of having feebly served thee,
every hope but that of thy mercy! Go,
Claude, and let my daughters pray for
the trembling sinner!"</p>

<p>The younger of the two nuns now
left the chamber, and soon returned to
kneel again, at the bedside of the sufferer.
The two nuns had obeyed the
words of the Superior, but although in
the presence of approaching death, near
the bed of that dying woman who trembled
for her salvation, not a sign of terror
or of pity appeared upon their features.
Their faces seemed of marble,
lighted up by living eyes; they had not
looked, they had not spoken to each
other; they had not rendered to the
Superior one of those kind offices which
bring some solace to the suffering of the
sick, while the knell tolled and vibrated
above the gloomy abode.</p>

<p>A half hour passed in the same sad
monotony, and the knell still sounded.
The Superior rose for a moment almost
half erect, and casting a bewildered
glance around, said in a gloomy tone:</p>

<!-- page 188 col 2 -->

<p>"Enough, enough! God has cursed
me; no priest will come, and I shall
die without confession and absolution.
Go&mdash;let the prayers cease! who prays
for the damned!"</p>

<p>She sank backward upon the bed,
and the two sisters elevated their voices,
and rehearsed their prayers so loud as
to drown the groans of the dying woman.</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of the
chapel bell was blended with that of
another, the bell of the outer gate of the
convent. The Superior raised her hands
towards heaven, and said in an ardent
tone:</p>

<p>"Blessed be thou, oh, my God! thou
dost not leave me to die with guilt upon
my soul."</p>

<p>The two nuns remained motionless.
It was not their office to open the gate
or to announce the arrival of those who
entered the convent, and they remained
upon their knees, continuing their prayers.
The Superior with her eyes closed,
and as if lost in thought, seemed to feel
neither impatience nor curiosity. A
long space of time elapsed, when a
third nun appeared at the threshold of
the apartment.</p>

<p>Before speaking, she kneeled, muttered
a short prayer, and then said:</p>

<p>"Mother, a stranger demands our
hospitality for this night and for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is it not a priest?" said the Superior,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"He wears the garb of a pilgrim, but
we have not asked him whether he is a
minister of God."</p>

<p>"Whatever he may be, let him receive
the hospitality which is due to
every traveller who claims it," said the
sufferer, "and since he is a pilgrim, bid
him pray for the salvation of the Superior
of this convent, for seven days, both
morning and evening, while he accomplishes
his pilgrimage. If he is a priest,
let him enter, for there is here a soul
about to appear before God, which stands
in need of the absolution of one of his
ministers, that it may be cleansed of a
last sin."</p>

<p>The nun left the chamber, the prayers
continued at the bedside of the sufferer,
the knell still sounded as though
no one had arrived. A moment after

<!-- page 189 col 1 -->

the nun entered, and said to the Superior:</p>

<p>"The pilgrim is not a priest, my mother,
but he has a writing from the pope
which authorizes him to receive confession
<i>in extremis</i> and to repeat it to a
priest."</p>

<p>"Let him enter then," said the Superior,
"if God has not willed to grant
me more, it is because I have not merited
it."</p>

<p>The nun left the chamber again and
reappeared with a man clothed, in truth,
as a pilgrim, but who was no other
than Pastourel. A sort of cowl covered
the upper part of his face, and he stepped
for a moment on the threshold at
the sight of the chill nakedness of the
chamber which he was about to enter.
The two nuns remained motionless, and
their eyes, which were fastened upon
the ground, were not raised to glance at
the new comer. A sensation of awe
and sorrow chilled Pastourel's bosom at
this spectacle of death, in which all solace
seemed wanting, even that of tears.
He approached the bed of the Superior,
and gazed for a moment at that pallid
face, withered as it was, more by penitence
than by years, at those blue and
hollow temples, that sharp and glistening
nose, those thin, pale lips, contracted
with pain; he beheld those meager
white and lifeless hands, and smitten
with a solemn grief, he said:</p>

<p>"In what can I serve you, madam?"</p>

<p>At this voice the women who were
kneeling at the bedside started with an
involuntary movement that was at once
controlled, however, and the Superior
raised herself, and unclosed her eyes,
which seemed to gleam with light, then
falling backward she exclaimed in a
tone of deep distress.</p>

<p>"My God! my God! deliver me
from this baneful thought; free me from
the temptation which rises incessantly
before my soul to entangle my last
steps."</p>

<p>Pastourel was moved by a feeling of
curiosity, and he said to the Superior:</p>

<p>"You have been told, madam, that I
have received from our holy father the
right to hear the confession of the dying,
and to repeat it to a priest."</p>

<p>"You will repeat mine to father Anselmo,"

<!-- page 189 col 2 -->

replied the Superior, "and if it
is God's will that he has left this world&mdash;for
until this day he has never failed
at our summons, you will repeat it to a
man of irreproachable sanctity, for the
greater the fault, the more powerful
should be the voice to absolve it."</p>

<p>"I shall soon visit Rome, madam,"
replied Pastourel, "I shall go thither, to
seek a pardon from our holy father for
an unworthy sinner, and it will but
commend me to him to be the bearer of
your last words."</p>

<p>"Do you go to our holy father, sir?
Oh, blessed be your steps! May God
guide you!"</p>

<p>"I listen, madam," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Father, draw nearer," said the dying
woman.</p>

<p>Pastourel bent over her; the two sisters,
concealed their faces upon the mattress,
and wrapped their heads in their
woollen veils, that they might not hear
her. The Superior continued:</p>

<p>"The crime which led me hither has
been confessed, and I have received absolution
for it, but you must hear it to
know how I have renewed it. A fault
rendered me a mother, and this fault I
have expiated by long years of suffering
in the world, and by long years of penitence
in this abode."</p>

<p>These words appeared strange to Pastourel,
who had come to seek the baroness
De la Roque, who had taken refuge
in this convent. He gazed more attentively
at the face which lay thus beneath
his eye, and he started backwards, as
if the flickering flame of the lamp, had
given familiar outlines to those thin and
withered features. It could not be the
baroness; the impress of age differs
widely from that of grief.</p>

<p>"I listen, madam," he replied.</p>

<p>"On entering this holy house, I took
a vow to forget all past affection, to expel
from my heart every remembrance
of the world which I had resigned, to
efface all regret for the deceitful joys of
life, to guard my soul from all return
to that which I ought so greatly to despise."</p>

<p>The sufferer paused, it seemed as if
she were unable to proceed; overwhelmed
rather by the thought of that
which she was about to utter than by

<!-- page 190 col 1 -->

the exertion she had made in speaking:</p>

<p>"Continue," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"After thirty years of solitude and
tears, at the moment when I am about
to appear before God, with a soul purified
by penitence, I have stumbled in
my path, and in my weakness I have
cried: I would resign my soul's salvation,
if, but for a moment before my
death, I could see that child which I
saw but a moment after its birth."</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried Pastourel, bending over the bed.</p>

<p>"Pray for her! she is dead!" said a
solemn voice, and he fell upon his knees
at the bedside, while one of the sisters
rose and left the chamber.</p>

<p>Pastourel still kept his place. All
the nuns of the convent entered, and
fell upon their knees around the bed,
while one of their number brought a
register in which she wrote a few lines.
When the prayer was ended, the nun
who had brought the register said to the
two sisters:</p>

<p>"Here is the certificate of the death
of our holy Superior. Sister Martha
and Sister Claude, you were present at
her decease, sign it."</p>

<p>The two nuns signed it.</p>

<p>"You also who have received her
last confession, sign it, sir," added the
nun.</p>

<p>Pastourel took the pen, and before
signing it, he read these words:</p>

<p>"On this day, August 20th, 1724,
died in our holy house, the pious and
devout dame Agatha, our Superior, formerly
known in the world as the right
noble demoiselle Armande de Lostanges,
dame Barati." Pastourel's brain
reeled; he looked again, and read these
words: "Were present at her decease
(the two signatures followed), Sister
Claude, formerly in the world Baroness
de la Roque; Sister Martha, formerly
in the world Duchess de Nevers."</p>

<p>Pastourel was obliged to lean against
the table to keep himself from falling,
and it was with a trembling hand that
he added below these names. "And
was present also at this decease to recognize
herein the hand of God, Giacomo
Spaffa, Prince of Puzzano."</p>

<p>The nun who had written the certificate,

<!-- page 190 col 2 -->

read it aloud, and it was only at
the moment that she pronounced Giacomo's
name, that Paula and Leonore
raised their eyes to his face, but not a
trace of emotion appeared in their features.</p>

<p>"And, now retire, sir," said the nun
who alone had spoken, "retire, sir; the
chapter is about to assemble to choose
a new Superior. Pray God that he may
inspire us to elect one worthy to take
the place of her whom we have lost."</p>

<p>Pastourel withdrew to the chamber
which had been assigned for his lodging,
and the nuns returned in procession
to the chapel.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE ELECTION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pastourel</span> passed a sleepless night,
the scene which he had just witnessed
had deeply affected him. His wild
hopes, his ambitious projects had vanished,
it is true; his son's ingratitude
had pierced his soul, and his gross vulgarity
had humbled his pride; but he
asked himself if this were enough?
if he deserved the least pity from heaven?
The words of Jean Couteau returned
incessantly to his mind, and
racked by grief and penitence he awaited
the dawn of day.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun appeared above
the horizon, the gate of the <i>communes</i>
was opened by the gardener, and he
could leave the building where he had
passed the night, but the convent remained
closed.</p>

<p>Pastourel inquired of the gardener by
what means he could see one of the
sisters of the community; the latter
answered that none of them could hold
communication with a stranger, except
by the express permission of the Superior,
and that as there was now no Superior,
it would be necessary to wait until
the election was concluded.</p>

<p>Pastourel resolved to profit by this
opportunity, in order to obtain from the
man some information which might be
useful to him, and he said:</p>

<!-- page 191 col 1 -->

<p>"Which of your dames will be chosen
Superior?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" said the gardener, who,
finding an occasion for speaking freely,
was disposed to take advantage of it,
"the dispute will be a warm one, for
there are two candidates, who have
each a party."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Pastourel, "and what are
the names of these two candidates?"</p>

<p>"Their names will not tell you
much," said the gardener, "but I know
well enough for whom I would vote, if
I had a voice in the chapter."</p>

<p>"For whom would you vote&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"For sister Martha, in truth, for sister
Martha."</p>

<p>This was the Duchess de Nevers.</p>

<p>"She is kind and generous then, I
suppose?" said Giacomo, who felt a
sensation of joy at this display of preference
for his sister.</p>

<p>"Between ourselves," replied the
gardener, "it is not for her kindness
and generosity, that I would choose her,
seeing that I have nothing to do with
them&mdash;in truth, do you see! it is thus&mdash;she
is not very zealous for the rules,
and if she were our Superior, <i>ma foi!</i>
one could regale himself a little, without
fear of being turned away; and if
a fair pilgrim came from time to time to
demand hospitality, I do not think that
sister Martha would make very strict
inquiries as to where she passed the
night."</p>

<p>The gardener winked as he said this,
and smiled significantly.</p>

<p>"It is your opinion then that sister
Martha finds it tiresome in the convent?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the gardener, "she weeps
less over her past faults, than for an opportunity
of repeating them."</p>

<p>"But how know you," said Pastourel,
"that sister Martha has any faults to
reproach herself with?"</p>

<p>"Why, if not, why should she be
here? Ah, ha! this is not a convent
of novices," said the gardener; "I will
answer for it, there is not one here who
in times past has not done something to
justify the rigor of our rules."</p>

<p>"But in this case it would seem that
they ought to be very indulgent. When
one has sinned oneself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 191 col 2 -->

<p>"Ha!" said the gardener, interrupting
Pastourel, in a tone of irony, "you must
be a very holy man if you think that.
They are all shrews. Hold, there was
Mother Agatha who has just died; she
had not formerly been very wicked, but
she was so anxious about her salvation,
that she held the reins pretty tight, but
it will be far worse if sister Claude is
chosen."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Pastourel, "it is sister
Claude, then, who disputes the place
with sister Martha, and she would be
more severe!"</p>

"She would be toward others what
she is toward herself. It is frightful,
my dear friend," said the gardener, "to
think what a woman's frame can endure.
Stay, now; I am passably sturdy and
strong; well, in the course of the holy
week, I lose more than thirty pounds;
I feel dizzy, as if I were drunk, the fasting
takes such hold of me. But as for
sister Claude, I cannot tell what she is
made of; she fasts every day; every
day, prayers, penance, discipline, vigils;
well, nothing affects her; she comes,
she goes, she is ready for everything
and at all hours, and I never meet her
that I do not start when she fixes her
flashing eyes upon me. How does she
live? What gives her this strength that
never wearies? If we were not in the
house of the Lord, and if she were not
the most exemplary of our dames, I
should think that she was possessed by
the devil."</p>

<p>Pastourel was reflecting upon these
words, when suddenly the chapel resounded
with chants and thanksgivings,
and the gardener said:</p>

<p>"Ah! the election is finished. They
are installing the new Superior. When
the ceremony is ended, I will present
your request to her."</p>

<p>"Who can they have chosen?" said
Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said the gardener;
"I will tell you at once."</p>

<p>He approached the chapel, listened,
and appeared greatly astonished.</p>

<p>He listened anew; at last he returned
with an air of disappointment, and
said to Pastourel:</p>

<p>"Something extraordinary is passing
in the chapel."</p>

<!-- page 192 col 1 -->

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I told you that I would soon know
which of our dames had been elected."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They have just finished with the
salutation, and as I know the voices of
them all, I said to myself: 'I shall hear
all those who repeat the formula before
the Superior, and the one whose voice is
wanting must have been elected.'&mdash;Well,
I counted; I recognized all the
voices that spoke; but I heard neither
the voice of sister Claude nor that of
sister Martha. Something has happened."</p>

<p>Pastourel conjectured that one of the
two claimants had refused to render homage
to the other, and the sole vexation
which he felt at this incident was that
he was still left in uncertainty as to the
result of the election. But Pastourel,
after having witnessed the strife of human
passions in the world, and under
their worst aspect, did not imagine that
he had yet a lesson to learn on this subject.</p>

<p>He waited until the ceremony was
ended, and hoping to obtain from his
sister more precise instructions as to the
manner in which he could serve the baroness,
he sent a request to the Superior,
whoever she might be, for permission
to see sister Martha.</p>

<p>"Sister Martha is not visible," was
the reply brought back by the porteress.</p>

<p>He questioned this nun in order to
learn if this refusal was owing to a
general rule or a particular prohibition,
but the woman refused to reply.</p>

<p>"Well then," he rejoined, "if sister
Martha is not visible to her brother, the
Prince of Puzzano, inquire if sister
Claude is visible to the shepherd Pastourel."</p>

<p>The nun retired, and returning in a
moment, said:</p>

<p>"She whom you have named sister
Claude, who is now our Superior, is not
visible."</p>

<p>"Well then!" rejoined Pastourel,
since sister Claude is the Superior,
and as it is she doubtless who forbids or
permits the others in this house, to receive
those who visit them, say to her
that I wish to see sister Martha, that I
am resolved to see her, that I am not a

<!-- page 192 col 2 -->

man to be stopped by the walls of a
Convent, and that I will enter it
forcibly, if I cannot otherwise see my
sister."</p>

<p>The nun had listened to Pastourel
with a coolness which was not in the
slightest degree disturbed by the threats
of the pilgrim, and Giacomo, who had
yielded to a hasty impulse of anger,
thinking that he might succeed better
by stratagem, added:</p>

<p>"Say also to sister Claude that
events are passing at the castle of La
Roque, of which it is necessary that she
should be informed."</p>

<p>The nun retired without replying,
and presently returned with this
answer:</p>

<p>"The violence with which the house
of the Lord is threatened brings no fear
to those who inhabit it, and as to our
worthy Superior, no tie now binds her
to the world upon which she has turned
her back, and all which passes there
should remain unknown to her."</p>

<p>A flush of anger and mortification
rose to Pastourel's cheek at these words.
The voice of repentance had begun to
murmur in his bosom, but it was drowned
by the promptings of pride. That
pride which had taken delight in influencing
the destinies of others, in shaping
them to his will, in suspending
them, controlling them, this pride still
swayed him; he felt humiliated at the
thought of leaving the Convent to seek
out Jean Couteau or Don Jos&eacute;, to say:
"I have tried to rescue Charlotte, and I
cannot!"</p>

<p>We are unable to say what resolution
Pastourel would have formed, if an
auxiliary had not suddenly arrived,
upon whom he was far from counting.</p>

<p>As a nun came to inform him that he
must leave the Convent before nights
fall, the bell of the outer gate of the
monastery was rung, and Pastourel, to
his astonishment, beheld Charlotte
enter, escorted by three men. One of
these men was the criminal judge, the
two others, his colleagues.</p>

<p>Pastourel advanced with curiosity,
and remarked upon the countenance of
Charlotte, an expression of anger and
of resolution which convinced him that
she would not submit to the disgrace

<!-- page 193 col 1 -->

with which she was threatened, without
defending herself to the last extremity,
and while the porteress went to inform
the Superior of this new visitor, he
approached the young girl, who did not
recognise him in his Pilgrim's garb,
and said hastily:</p>

<p>"The Superior of this convent is your
mother, the baroness De la Roque."</p>

<p>Then as the judge drew near to hear
what the stranger was saying to the
prisoner, Pastourel added:</p>

<p>"I have come here to see my sister,
who is confined in this house under the
name of sister Martha; they have refused
my request, and I was begging
this young girl to tell her that I am
here, and that it is important for the
safety of those who are most dear to
her, that I should see her. I will venture
also to pray you, sir, to intercede
for me with the Superior, for I suppose
you are about to be admitted to her
presence."</p>

<p>"You will see her yourself, sir," said
the judge, "for she will come to receive
her whom I am about to entrust to her
care."</p>

<p>In truth, a moment after, the Superior,
accompanied by four sisters, appeared
at the principal door of the inner building.
The judge and his colleagues
bent their knees respectfully, while the
Superior gave them her blessing, and
the judge then read aloud the following
document.</p>

<p>"On this day, to wit, the 21st of August,
1724, I, Normand, criminal judge
of the bailiwick of Foix, accompanied
by my two colleagues, have at the
request of baron De la Roque placed in
the hands of dame Agatha&mdash;"</p>

<p>The judge paused, and said:</p>

<p>"I was ignorant that the convent had
a new Superior."</p>

<p>"Write Claude," replied the Superior
in a solemn voice, undisturbed by the
slightest emotion.</p>

<p>The judge changed the name and
resumed:</p>

<p>"I have placed in the hands of dame
Claude, Superior of the convent of St.
Benoit, the demoiselle Charlotte De la
Roque, that she may remain here confined
until it is the pleasure of her
father to remove her, in which case

<!-- page 193 col 2 -->

dame Claude engages to restore her at
the simple demand of the said Sieur
baron De la Roque."</p>

<p>The document having been read, the
judge continued:</p>

<p>"Will you receive the prisoner and
sign this paper?"</p>

<p>"It is my duty to do so," said the
Superior.</p>

<p>She signed the document without
the slightest change in the icy coldness
of her features, and when the associate
judges had signed it as witnesses, the
Superior said to Charlotte:</p>

<p>"Enter, my daughter?"</p>

<p>This title was not that which a mother
gives to her child. The Superior called
Charlotte her daughter as she called
Pastourel her brother, because it was
the consecrated word. Giacomo now
advanced, and said with an air of profound
reverence:</p>

<p>"Madam, I have requested to see
sister Martha."</p>

<p>"Sister Martha is in the hall of the
penitents&mdash;the rules do not admit it."</p>

<p>"In that case, madam, it is you to
whom I would speak."</p>

<p>"I desire to hear nothing of worldly
matters."</p>

<p>And directing Charlotte to precede
her, she entered the convent and the
door was closed. A moment after a
collation was served up before the
judges in that part of the <i>communes</i>
where Pastourel had been lodged.
After two hours of repose, the judge
was about to return home, when new
comers prevented his departure as well
as that of Pastourel. These new comers
were D'Auterive, Bernard and Galidou.
But before we recount the motives
which led to their arrival, we
must describe the scene which passed
in the interior of the convent.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>

<p class="small">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a person in Charlotte's position
entered the convent, the custom, if
not the rules required that she should
pass a kind of examination of conscience

<!-- page 194 col 1 -->

before the Superior, who treated her
more or less rigorously, according to
the degree of penitence which the prisoner
seemed to manifest; for young
girls of rank were never imprisoned in
this manner unless for some grave fault.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the imperturbability
with which the baroness had
heard the name of the maiden, who
was thus placed in her keeping. Was
her indifference a mask with which she
had learned to hide the most violent
emotions? or was her heart so hardened
in the exercise of her monastic
duties, that she required no effort to
conceal them.</p>

<p>The sisters of the convent of St.
Benoit were unable to decide, for mother
Claude, turning toward them, said in a
calm and icy tone:</p>

<p>"I am about to interrogate this young
girl according to usage, and I will afterwards
inform you as to the manner in
which she must be treated."</p>

<p>The nuns bent their heads, and the
Superior said to Charlotte:</p>

<p>"Follow me, my daughter."</p>

<p>She led the way, ascended the stairs
with a slow and firm step, entered the
cell from which the corpse of the previous
Superior had been removed in
order to be placed in the chapel, and
taking a seat, she signed to Charlotte
to draw near, and said to her in a stern
and severe voice:</p>

<p>"For what fault have you been
brought here?"</p>

<p>Charlotte did not reply; she gazed
attentively at this woman, whose gleaming
eyes expressed neither curiosity,
nor agitation, nor anger. This woman
was her mother; she could not but
know that it was her daughter whom
she thus addressed, and still nothing
seemed to indicate it. Notwithstanding
the calculating selfishness of Charlotte's
character, her heart was not destitute of
those lively impulses which are ever
found in youth, and she felt deeply agitated
at finding herself in the presence
of her mother, whom she had not seen
for sixteen years.</p>

<p>Absorbed in these thoughts, more
troubled than she was willing to appear
at this chilling reception, Charlotte did

<!-- page 194 col 2 -->

not reply, but remained with her eyes
fixed upon the Superior.</p>

<p>"Have you heard me?" rejoined the
latter sternly, "or do you refuse to answer?"</p>

<p>The severity with which this question
was uttered, irritated Charlotte, whose
emotions of tenderness were far from
being intense, and she replied:</p>

<p>"I have heard you, madam, and I
am ready to answer you."</p>

<p>"For what fault have you been
brought here?"</p>

<p>"For the fault of another, madam,"
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"It is the usual answer of the guilty."</p>

<p>"On this occasion, madam," replied
Charlotte haughtily, "it is the answer of
an innocent person."</p>

<p>The baroness manifested no emotion,
but she did not at once reply; it seemed
as if she reflected upon the words which
she was about to utter.</p>

<p>"The baron De la Roque," she said
at last, "is sometimes violent, hasty,
unjust, and it is, perhaps, an impulse
of unreflecting anger, which has urged
him to this act of severity."</p>

<p>"The baron De la Roque has been
just in his conduct towards me, madam,"
replied Charlotte, with a smile of
keen disdain; "he has even displayed
clemency. It is neither through his
fault, nor through mine that I am here."</p>

<p>A glance of more than usual brightness
was the only sign which admonished
Charlotte that her words had
reached their aim, but the Superior
controlled herself, and rejoined:</p>

<p>"If it suits you to make a mystery
of the motives which have led to your
imprisonment, it is neither my duty,
nor have I the power to wrest your
secret from you. I will order, therefore,
that they lead you to the cell
which you are to occupy."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, madam, it suits
me to inform you of my secret; my
mother is confined in this convent;
you know it, for you have heard my
name, and as that which has led me hither
concerns her, I do not think that I can
ask counsel from any one more properly
than from yourself, as to the manner
in which I should conduct myself towards
her."</p>

<!-- page 195 col 1 -->

<p>All the baroness' self control could
not disguise the change in her voice, as
she replied:</p>

<p>"You know the respect which a
daughter owes to her mother."</p>

<p>"As I know," said Charlotte, "the
affection which a mother owes to her
daughter."</p>

<p>Had the baroness been standing, her
limbs would perhaps have failed her at
the tone of menace in which these
words were uttered.</p>

<p>"What have you to claim from your
mother's affection?" said the baroness.</p>

<p>"That which is her duty before man
and before God," said Charlotte, "the
truth!"</p>

<p>"The truth," replied the Superior;
"explain yourself; enough of evasions!
speak, and I will answer in place of your
mother."</p>

<p>"Do so, madam," replied Charlotte,
"and tell me what it is my duty to do
under the circumstances in which I am
placed."</p>

<p>Charlotte's features assumed an expression
of cruel malignity, and she
continued, gazing steadfastly at the Baroness:</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of the Baroness
de la Roque, madam, but I am not the
daughter of the Baron de la Roque."</p>

<p>Charlotte paused; the Superior, with
a quick tone, responded:</p>

<p>"Proceed!"</p>

<p>"He who is my father, Comte Jos&eacute;
de Frias, disclosed this secret to me."</p>

<p>The lips of the Baroness moved convulsively,
and she muttered a few words
which Charlotte could not hear.</p>

<p>"Proceed!" she said, raising her
voice.</p>

<p>"The Comte de Frias, after having
convinced me of the truth of this secret
by a Solitary of the mountain, whom
my mother must remember under the
name of Pastourel, and who is no other
than the Prince of Puzzano, the Comte
de Frias, I say, my real father, madam,
has easily persuaded me that it is disgraceful
and dishonest to keep a name
which does not belong to me, and to
claim the heritage of wealth, which
ought not to be mine; and prompted by
the voice of conscience, I resolved to fly
with him. But at the moment when we

<!-- page 195 col 2 -->

were about to depart, we were surprised
and arrested; then, madam, the Baron
de la Roque has viewed as a crime that
flight which was but an expiation; has
seen a lover in the father, whom I was
about to follow, and he has offered me
the alternative of a marriage with the
Comte de Frias, or of public dishonor,
by a suit in which the Comte will be
accused of having induced me to elope
with him from my father's house."</p>

<p>Charlotte paused to watch the effect
of this disclosure, but the Baroness, with
that calmness which so well concealed
her emotions, replied:</p>

<p>"Wo to the daughter who opens her
ear to calumny against her mother!&mdash;punishment
will not fail to follow."</p>

<p>At these words it was Charlotte's turn
to hesitate: she could not imagine that
a mother could hear an accusation like
that from the lips of a daughter without
displaying some sign of emotion; and
she said to herself: "She is not my
mother."</p>

<p>"The fault that you have committed,
young girl," continued the Superior, "is
unpardonable, and you will never leave
this convent."</p>

<p>At these words all Charlotte's violence,
all her pride, was aroused, and
she cried:</p>

<p>"I am here under the protection of
the laws, and I shall leave it upon a requisition
from the Baron de la Roque."</p>

<p>"You will never leave these walls,"
responded the Baroness.</p>

<p>The tone of menace in which these
words were uttered, instead of terrifying
Charlotte, restored her energy, which
was for a moment shaken, and she replied
with a scornful smile:</p>

<p>"Besides, madam, if they have imposed
upon my credulity; if the Comte
de Frias has lied to me to induce me to
quit France, all can easily be arranged.
Let my mother swear before God, that
Don Jos&eacute;'s words are false; that I am
not his daughter; and I will myself solicit
this marriage, which alone can restore
my honor, for this shall not be
slandered."</p>

<p>"You demand an oath before God?"
said the Baroness, in a gloomy voice.</p>

<p>"With her hand upon the crucifix,"

<!-- page 196 col 1 -->

replied Charlotte, "and I will believe
that I have been deceived."</p>

<p>The Baroness gazed long and steadfastly
at Charlotte, and said at last, in a
hollow and stifled voice:</p>

<p>"Do you know to whom you are
speaking, unhappy child?"</p>

<p>"To the Superior of the Convent of
Saint Benoit," said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"You are speaking to your mother,"
cried the Baroness, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"I should not have supposed it from
the reception which she has given me,
for she knew that she was speaking to
her daughter."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the baroness, whose
features were agitated by a convulsive
tremor, "yes, it is a just retribution!
On the day when I believed I had acquired
pardon for my fault by fifteen
years of penitence, of maceration and
prayer&mdash;on this day it rises up to reproach
me; and called up by whom?
Oh, God! by my daughter!"</p>

<p>Charlotte was somewhat moved by
this manifestation of despair; she took
a step toward the baroness, saying, in a
softer tone:</p>

<p>"My mother!"</p>

<p>The baroness repulsed her with an
imperious gesture.</p>

<p>"I am no longer a mother," she said.
"I have never been one!"</p>

<p>She rose, and stretching her arms toward
heaven, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is this justice, oh God? Thou hast
promised absolution to repentance, pardon
to penitence; and to what have
served all the fair years of my youth, lost,
stifled, withered in this retreat. No, it is
not justice. Thou dost allot too fair a
portion to crime, that Thy servants
should not follow after it; Thou dost
not measure the trial to the strength;&mdash;and
what wonder that the victim falls?
Well, so he it&mdash;so be it!"</p>

<p>Her mother's wildness terrified Charlotte,
and she said in a hurried tone:</p>

<p>"The secret has never left my bosom,
madam."</p>

<p>The baroness gazed upon her with
fearful anxiety, and after a short silence,
replied:</p>

<p>"Is this true?"</p>

<p>"I swear it! If it were otherwise,

<!-- page 196 col 2 -->

would I have been dragged hither, sullied
and dishonored?"</p>

<p>"And still," rejoined the baroness,
"this secret which you boast of having
kept so carefully, you disclosed to the
Superior of this convent."</p>

<p>"I knew in whose presence I stood,
madam."</p>

<p>The Superior started backward in terror,
and said, while a tear trembled upon
her eyelids:</p>

<p>"You knew this, and you spoke to
me as you did."</p>

<p>"I regulated my words by yours,"
replied Charlotte, boldly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the baroness, "in what
way of crime and vice have you been
reared by him whose name you bear?"</p>

<p>"My conduct is pure, madam!" exclaimed
Charlotte; "there is not an hour
of my life that I fear to submit to the
judgment of mankind."</p>

<p>"Even this hour?" said the baroness.</p>

<p>"I am innocent, madam; and I have
come here to request my mother to give
the proof of my innocence to those who
accuse me."</p>

<p>"Even at the price of her honor?"
said the baroness.</p>

<p>"Should mine remain sullied?" replied
Charlotte, coldly.</p>

<p>"But do you know," cried Paula,
who now wept freely, "do you know
what I have suffered for these fifteen
years, in order to preserve that honor
which you would wrest from me? Do
you know what it is to live, young, beautiful,
with a heart full of passion in this
cold and fearful solitude? to be enclosed
in this tomb, more narrow than the
grave, and which nothing can penetrate
but sorrow? Do you know the strength
which I have needed to endure this trial
without hope, without solace, without
affection? Do you know all this, and
yet venture to appear here, to bid me
resign the fruit of all these fearful sacrifices?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, madam," replied
Charlotte, "the strength that is required
to conceal a fault of which one is guilty,
but I have been obliged to learn what
firmness is necessary to support a misfortune
which has been bequeathed to
me by a fault of which I am innocent.
You have lived in penitence, madam;

<!-- page 197 col 1 -->

you have imposed upon yourself severe
mortifications; I have been compelled to
submit to those which have been inflicted
upon me by your husband, who struck
the child because the mother had escaped
him; you have sacrificed me to the
phantom of your honor, and should I
spare you, and leave in doubt the purity
of mine? I am an unworthy child,
perhaps; but what could she expect who
has been an unworthy mother? You
have been unwilling to endure dishonor;
I also am unwilling to endure it. Let
God judge between us."</p>

<p>At this reply the baroness rose suddenly
erect, and remained for a moment
motionless. She stammered a few
words, among which Charlotte could
distinguish the following:</p>

<p>"My God! my God! wilt thou never
pardon me?"</p>

<p>Then her eyes rolled, a few convulsive
sobs broke from her breast, and, as
if stricken by lightning, she fell suddenly
upon the marble pavement of her
cell&mdash;She was dead!</p>

<p>At this spectacle Charlotte uttered a
piercing shriek, and called for help.
A few nuns entered, and raised the
body. The face was livid, and frightfully
distorted, the limbs stiffened and
rigid as iron, the hands clenched, the
eyes open and almost starting from
their sockets.</p>

<p>Charlotte, overcome with horror stood
gazing at the hideous corpse, while the
sisters questioned her concerning the
cause of this fearful occurrence. She
did not hear them; her eyes seemed
fastened upon that face, the expression
of which appeared still so implacable;
and when, at last, she recovered from
her stupor, the first words which escaped
her lips were these:</p>

<p>"Who now will prove my innocence?"</p>

<p>Paula's body had in the meanwhile
been deposited upon the same bed from
which, a few hours before, they had
removed the lifeless remains of Armande,
and one of the nuns having approached
Charlotte, said to her in a
solemn tone:</p>

<p>"My daughter, we permit you to
pray near the corpse of your mother,
until the certificate of her death is drawn

<!-- page 197 col 2 -->

up, which you will sign, for you alone
were present at her decease."</p>

<p>The nuns now retired, and left Charlotte
alone with the lifeless remains of
her mother. Soon the chapel resounded
with the same chants which had been
heard on the preceding evening, and
the knell proclaimed that another of the
nuns of the convent had departed this
life.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>

<p class="small">SCHEMES OF VENGEANCE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bell had just begun to toll when
Bernard, Galidou, and D'Auterive reached
the convent. They were the bearers
of an order from the baron de la Roque,
demanding the restoration of his daughter;
they placed it in the hands of the
criminal judge, who at once desired to
see the Superior. It was then that the
porteress announced that she was dead.</p>

<p>Bernard requested permission to see
his mother. This permission could
only be granted by a new Superior, and
he was obliged to wait until the chapter
had made their choice. Pastourel
calmed the impatience of the young
Marquis, who seemed resolved to force
his way into the monastery. His heart
was filled with a fearful presentiment,
yet he durst not accuse Charlotte, who,
as the amorous Bernard declared, was
the object of base calumnies, and he inquired
the reason which had induced the
baron de la Roque to retract his order.
The following account was given him
by Bernard.</p>

<p>The reader will remember, doubtless,
that at the moment of Don Jos&eacute;'s arrest;
he had requested an interview with
Bernard, which the latter had promised
him. The baron de la Roque had
heard this promise, but he had not opposed
its execution. Solely occupied
with his vengeance, he saw but one alternative:
either Don Jos&eacute; will confess
the truth, and the proud Paula is ruined
together with her lover, or he will be
silent, and Charlotte is ruined together
with her father.</p>

<p>When Bernard entered the presence

<!-- page 198 col 1 -->

of the man, whom he still knew only
under the name of Vasconcellos, he had
provided means for his escape, and had
brought with him two swords. The
young Marquis showed them to him, as
he entered the chamber in which Vasconcellos
was confined, and said:</p>

<p>"It is with these, sir, that we will
explain matters."</p>

<p>Vasconcellos sole reply was a smile
of disdain.</p>

<p>"You are afraid then, Master Vasconcellos,"
said Bernard.</p>

<p>"Marquis De Velay," replied Don
Jos&eacute;, in a stern voice, "I am called
the Comte De Frias; you cannot be a
stranger to that name, and you should
know that none of those who bear it,
bear it unworthily, say you!"</p>

<p>"The Conte De Frias, say you?
The Comte De Frias was my father's
friend. He had a son?"</p>

<p>"Don Jos&eacute; De Frias. I am he."</p>

<p>"Who lived for many a year in the
Castle of La Roque?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"And who disappeared at the time
when the Baroness de la Roque retired
to the convent of Saint Benoit?"</p>

<p>"I expected to tell you my history,
marquis, but you seem well acquainted
with it."</p>

<p>"And what is this history to our affair,
sir," replied the marquis, "unless it be
that instead of supposing that I am about
to measure swords with an adventurer, I
may know that I am about to contend
against an equal."</p>

<p>"M. De Velay," rejoined Don Jos&eacute;,
"can you not comprehend me? If I
have disclosed myself to you, if I have
recalled to your remembrance my sojourn
in the castle of La Roque, and my disappearance
at the time when the unhappy
Paula retired from the world, can
you not comprehend, I say, that in all
these circumstances, there may be something
which can explain this flight of
Charlotte's, otherwise than by a love
which is culpable, and of which you have
cause to be jealous."</p>

<p>Bernard well understood the meaning
of these words, and he reflected carefully
before replying:</p>

<p>"You have long deferred the disclosure
of this secret," he said at last;

<!-- page 198 col 2 -->

"had you done so sooner, all this would
not have happened, neither would you
have run any risk in doing so. But is
it not an invention to free yourself from
the danger which threatens you?"</p>

<p>"And what is this danger which has
such terrors for me?"</p>

<p>"That of rendering me an account for
your elopement with Charlotte."</p>

<p>"Well, then. Marquis De Velay,"
replied Don Jos&eacute;, "let it be understood
that I am ready to render this account
either as a father or as a lover; and,
that settled, I do not hesitate to tell you
that I depend upon you to wrest Charlotte
from the violence and brutality of
the Baron de la Roque."</p>

<p>"This violence and this brutality need
not be feared now, for Mademoiselle de
la Roque (I must still call her by this
name), is at present at the convent of
Saint Benoit."</p>

<p>"She must be set at liberty then, sir,"
replied Don Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"And with what intent?"</p>

<p>After these preliminary explanations,
Don Jos&eacute; finished by describing clearly
to Bernard, the position in which he
stood; he convinced the marquis that
he had been used as an instrument of
the baron's vengeance, who was resolved
to ruin either Charlotte or Paula, and
Bernard at last engaged to liberate the
maiden from her confinement.</p>

<p>This interview was long, and it had
not yet ended, when Galidou, D'Auterive
and Barati, arrived at the castle,
hoping to find the criminal judge still
there, while Jean Couteau escorted the
Comtesse D'Auterive to her dwelling.
They now heard the cause of the judge's
absence. We request the reader's permission
to describe the scene which occurred
in reference to this subject; it
turns, indeed, upon facts already known
to him, but it will add a most striking trait
to the different characters which we have
endeavored to depict in this narrative.</p>

<p>The three new comers had been admitted
into the baron's presence, who requested
to know what led them in search
of the criminal judge at that hour. D'Auterive
had given his uncle, a somewhat
exaggerated account of the violence
which had been inflicted upon
them by the shepherd Pastourel, an account

<!-- page 199 col 1 -->

in which the baron had not placed
the slightest confidence, for when D'Auterive
had concluded, he said to him, in
a tone of mockery:</p>

<p>"And what motive led you to Pastourel,
my dear nephew?"</p>

<p>"To obtain certain information concerning
a person in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"<i>Peste!</i>" said the baron, "since you
came here to give your consent to
Bernard's marriage, I should think that
the information which you first needed
should concern me, or, at least, my
daughter, and I think, nephew, that our
acquaintance is of too old a date to
leave you in ignorance as to myself."</p>

<p>"And if it were so, uncle," said
D'Auterive, "a marriage is too serious
an affair to be arranged in haste, and I
did not think it useless to inquire into
the conduct of the maiden to whom I
was about to entrust a young man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whom you love as a son, although
you are scarcely entitled by your age to
do so."</p>

<p>"What mean you, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the old man, with a
savage laugh, "it is a consolation to
know that the most skilful and crafty
belong to the great fraternity. What
say you, master Barati?"</p>

<p>"To each his calamity, baron, and
to each his vengeance. I have journeyed
two hundred leagues to reach mine, and
it will not escape me."</p>

<p>"I have not left my house for mine,"
said the baron, "and I hold it sure."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, uncle," said D'Auterive,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Do you then know nothing of
what has passed here this evening?"</p>

<p>"We were told," replied D'Auterive,
"but I did not comprehend it."</p>

<p>"How! you do not comprehend that
this Vasconcellos is Don Jos&eacute; himself."</p>

<p>At this disclosure a part of the baron's
plan was unveiled before the eyes of
D'Auterive; but the old man did not
give him time to calculate the probabilities
of its success, but proceeded to
develop it with that savage joy which
he had displayed to Jean Couteau. In
truth, it seemed impossible that his
vengeance could escape him. But for
his blindness, he would have felt flattered
by the gleam of admiration which

<!-- page 199 col 2 -->

lighted up the features of old Barati.
But the latter was unable to control the
emotion which agitated him, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you at least will strike all the
guilty ones!"</p>

<p>"Ah! old councillor," said the baron,
"I would give up two of them to be
able to seize the third; I would let Don
Jos&eacute; and Charlotte go, if I could but
strip from Paula that mask of virtue
which covers her, if I could but tear
her from that convent, where, like your
wife, who is now the Superior there,
she has gained so fair a name for sanctity."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Galidou, "my mother
is still living, and I did not know it!"</p>

<p>A gleam of hate and vengeance
seemed at once to light up the spirit of
Barati. Excited as he was by the
baron's diabolical craft, and resolved not
to be surprised by him in his schemes
of vengeance, he replied in a tone of
hypocritical anger:</p>

<p>"Yes, she lives, and I have concealed
you from her, lest she might testify that
you are in truth the son of this wretch
Giacomo, and thus defeat the investigation
which will call upon him to prove
that you are not a suppositious child."</p>

<p>It was apparently an act of great
imprudence on the part of Barati, to
inform Galidou in what manner he could
escape the danger by which he was
threatened; even in case that the restoration
of the prince of Puzzano to his
rights should be revoked, he was not the
less his son, and according to that great
principle of the law: <i>Infans pro nato
habetur quoties de rebus suis agitur</i>&mdash;a
natural and not an adulterine son.</p>

<p>Barati did not explain himself farther,
for he observed the air of anxiety which
was visible upon Galidou's features, and
he thought himself sure of success.</p>

<p>"Good! good!" he said to himself,
"I will cause the mother to be disgraced,
by the son; he will demand from her the
avowal of her fault, in order to profit by
it."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Bernard
requested to speak with the baron.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the old man, "here
comes the precious instrument of my

<!-- page 200 col 1 -->

vengeance; he is the man to aid you
in obtaining yours&mdash;let me contrive it."</p>

<p>Bernard entered, and commenced by
saying that he had accused Charlotte
unjustly, that she was innocent, that he
would be warrant for her innocence,
and that, to convince the baron, he
declared himself ready to espouse her.</p>

<p>The baron listened patiently, and then
said:</p>

<p>"This devotion is praiseworthy,
marquis De Velay, but it proves one
thing; namely, that you are very
credulous, and very much in love."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bernard, "I am not
a man easy to be deceived, and if Vasconcellos'
explanations had not been
satisfactory to my honor, I would not
have offered to become a warrant for
them."</p>

<p>"It is possible that they may be satisfactory
to you, marquis, but I think it
necessary that they should be so to me
likewise," replied the baron, "I will
judge of them when you have rehearsed
them to me."</p>

<p>"I have told you, sir, that I am ready
to espouse her," rejoined Bernard, "and
this, as I think, should satisfy in all
points, the honor of a father."</p>

<p>D'Auterive, impelled by the blind avarice
which he hoped to satisfy by
Charlotte's ruin, had the imprudence to
interfere in this discussion, and said:</p>

<p>"But, do you think that I would
consent to this marriage after the accusation
that has been brought against
mademoiselle De la Roque? I speak
it with regret in my uncle's presence,
but I should abuse the confidence which
the duke, your father, has placed in me,
if I were to give my consent, after this
public scandal."</p>

<p>This poor D'Auterive imagined that
he was furthering the designs of his
uncle, as well as his own interests by
compelling Bernard to reveal the secret,
which had so suddenly quieted his suspicions
of Charlotte, but the baron was
unwilling to receive this aid which
would place the marquis in a position
of superiority towards him, and he
replied in a mild and hypocritical tone:</p>

<p>"And then, M. De Velay, I should
forget my duty as a father should I consent
to this marriage, for I must needs

<!-- page 200 col 2 -->

say that your own name is not so free
from all stain of this kind, that the offer
of your hand would be a sufficient
answer to the slanders of the world.
Sons are apt to inherit the weaknesses
of their parents, and they would say,
perhaps, that the marquis De Valey had
espoused a woman who was dishonored,
as the father looked tamely upon the
dishonor of his wife."</p>

<p>"Who dares to say that?" cried
Bernard violently, "it is a falsehood, a
base calumny! and coming from you
it is an act of cowardice, for your age
and helplessness shield you against my
anger."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, marquis," replied the
baron, "since you set yourself up for a
defender of maidens who elope with
their lovers, and of dames who have
entertained gallants, you will find some
one here to answer you."</p>

<p>"Who?" exclaimed Bernard.</p>

<p>"Why, my nephew, comte D'Auterive,
who knows better than any one
else that I utter no calumny against the
duchess, your mother."</p>

<p>At this moment Bernard recalled to
mind the singular smile which had
escaped Pastourel, when he confessed to
him his own <i>liaison</i> with the comtesse
D'Auterive, and the words which he
had uttered:</p>

<p>"It is heaven's vengeance!"</p>

<p>His anger was strangely soothed by
this recollection; he was embarrassed
in spite of himself as to the tone which
he should assume in demanding satisfaction
of an injury from a man upon
whom he had inflicted an equal one.</p>

<p>"Ha, baron!" cried Barati, "we
need not complain of the children who
do not belong to us, when those whose
legitimacy is incontestible, hesitate to
defend their mothers."</p>

<p>"The marquis hesitates," said D'Auterive,
with some agitation, "because
he does not credit the injurious words
of my uncle. The duchess De Nevers
merits universal respect, and I should
be more infamous than Bernard, if I
suffered her to be calumniated."</p>

<p>Galidou now interposed in his turn.</p>

<p>"Bravo, comte D'Auterive!" he
cried, "you have just taken a great
burden from the heart of the marquis by

<!-- page 201 col 1 -->

releasing him from the necessity of
calling you to an account for such an
injury, for it is hard to be compelled to
expose one's life, when one is about to
espouse a young and beautiful maiden."</p>

<p>"Marquis of Veroni," said Bernard,
with a lordly air, "if I knew by what
right you bear this title, I would teach
you to swallow your insolence at the
point of the sword."</p>

<p>"If proof is all that you need, I beg
you to demand it of Pastourel. He
will teach you that we are near enough
akin, and that you cannot well compromise
your rank by a meeting with
me."</p>

<p>"<i>Peste!</i> and what is Pastourel to
me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, I should think," replied Galidou,
"that the prince of Puzzano, your
uncle, ought to know better than any
one else whether his own son is of a
birth sufficiently noble to measure
swords with his nephew."</p>

<p>"<i>Peste!</i> my uncle Giacomo!" cried
Bernard.</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," said D'Auterive, "and
it was for this reason that I visited him
to obtain his opinion as to your marriage."</p>

<p>"And he is the father of the marquis
of Veroni?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barati, "and it was for
this that I repaired to the ruins to take
vengeance upon him."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, cousin!" said Bernard,
gaily, "excuse the tone in which I
spoke to you," he then added, laughing,
"since you have observed my hesitation
to quarrel with the comte, I ought to
explain; having had the honor to be on
quite a familiar footing with madam
D'Auterive, I thought our accounts
about even, and it seemed to me ungenerous
to call upon him to pay the cost
of this explanation into the bargain.
Now that he is informed of it, I am at
his orders."</p>

<p>As Bernard spoke, the baron De la
Roque shook in his chair with laughter.</p>

<p>"How! is it so? my nephew too&mdash;it
is admirable! it is charming!" and
he laughed so that the hall echoed
again. Galidou and Bernard followed
his example, while D'Auterive turning
furiously to Barati, exclaimed:</p>

<!-- page 201 col 2 -->

<p>"It is you, who, by giving me a
creature picked up in the street, have
exposed me to this dishonor; she has
not belied the baseness of her birth."</p>

<p>"And the duchess De Nevers,"
replied Barati, "and the baroness De
la Roque and Armande De Lostanges,
were they picked up in the street?
They were of the high noblesse, and
you know what they have done."</p>

<p>"If he knows that," said Bernard,
"to the devil with all promises! Baron
De la Roque, Charlotte is not guilty,
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A word suffices," said the baron,
"M. De Frias has told you all."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are ready to affirm it, and
repeat it before witnesses?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the baron, "that
is all that I require. Charlotte shall be
restored to liberty. Draw up an order
directing them to place her in your
hands. I can sign it in spite of my
blindness. But, remember, that it will
be necessary for you to repeat the accusation
against Frias and the baroness
before the criminal judge."</p>

<p>"I will do so."</p>

<p>"Nephew," said the baron, turning
to D'Auterive, "I hope that you will be
so obliging as to defer your vengeance
until this evidence has been received."</p>

<p>D'Auterive, who had not spoken for
some moments, replied:</p>

<p>"Uncle, it would be perhaps more
suitable if you were to entrust me with
the order for Charlotte's release."</p>

<p>"Be it so. I will keep M. De Velay
here, and then I shall be sure that there
will be no quarreling."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Bernard, "but I
wish to go to the convent of Saint
Benoit. I must speak with my mother."</p>

<p>"And I will accompany you," said
Galidou, "to prevent mischief."</p>

<p>"Must you also see your mother?"
said Barati.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, sir," said Galidou.</p>

<p>The three now took their departure
from the castle, leaving the baron De la
Roque and Barati alone. That which
took place at the convent after their
arrival there, will inform the
reader of the projects which these
three personages had formed upon the road.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

<p class="small">THE CHAPEL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we have said, Pastourel, before
informing the new comers of that which
had passed in the convent, wished to
learn the motives by which the baron
had been so easily induced to give an
order for Charlotte's release. Bernard
informed him; and the prince of Puzzano
now comprehended that the baron
was more eager to execute his vengeance
against Paula than to punish
Charlotte. He wished also to know
what had brought D'Auterive to the
convent, and why Galidou had accompanied
them, but they were both less
communicative than Bernard. The
comte gave the reason which he had
given to the baron, and Galidou pretended
that he was curious to see the
convent, without betraying the slightest
intimation of his knowledge of his
mother's existence and of his desire to
see her.</p>

<p>In the mean while the chapel resounded
with the chants announcing
the election of a new Superior. Pastourel
had requested the judge and the
gardener not to inform the new comers
of the sudden and unexpected death of
the two Superiors, and he had under
various pretexts delayed them from
requesting admission.</p>

<p>During the interval he had sent a
billet to the new Superior, in which he
had explained, doubtless, the motive of
his visit. A messenger now came to
inform those who waited that they
should send in their requests to the
Superior, and that she would answer
them. Each one sent in his own&mdash;that
is to say, D'Auterive demanded simply
to speak with the Superior, Bernard to
see the duchess De Nevers, and Galidou
to see Madame Armande De Lostanges.
The criminal judge transmitted
the order for Charlotte's release. To
the great astonishment of all, they at
once received answer that they could
enter the convent, and they were immediately
led to the chapel.</p>

<p>A melancholy spectacle met their
eyes as they entered. In the middle of

<!-- page 202 col 1 -->

the nave stood two coffins, and in these
two coffins lay two bodies with their
hands crossed upon the breast and their
faces uncovered. At the foot of these
two coffins, a woman clad in the garb
of a nun, but wrapped in a long black
veil, was kneeling in prayer. At their
head, the Superior herself, known by
her cross of gold, was seated on an elevated
chair, where she had just received
the homage of the sisters of the community.
Her face was covered with a
long veil. Upon a bench on either side
of the coffins, were ranged the nuns,
all veiled.</p>

<p>This gloomy spectacle struck the
three new comers with secret terror,
and Pastourel himself paused, when
upon the point of breaking the silence.
The Superior addressed him:</p>

<p>"Pilgrim," she said, "you have come
to this house to speak with sister Martha.
What have you to say to her?
She is present, and will hear you."</p>

<p>"When those who have followed
me," replied Pastourel, "have told their
errand, I will speak, for I am too old to
be impatient, as they must be."</p>

<p>The Superior made no remark concerning
this reserve, and resumed with
the same solemnity:</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive, you have requested
an interview with the Superior
of this house; she is before you, she
hears you, speak!"</p>

<p>D'Auterive was deeply moved. The
Superior, being seated, as we have said,
at the head of the two coffins, while the
nuns were ranged on either side, it followed
that the strangers, among whom
was D'Auterive, stood at the foot of the
two biers, so that the words which they
uttered, passed over the two corpses,
which separated them. D'Auterive, we
say, was deeply moved, and was for
some moments unable to control his
agitation.</p>

<p>At last he spoke:</p>

<p>"In the first place, I have come as
the bearer of this order from my uncle,
which reclaims his daughter, who, owing
to a deplorable error, has been confined
in this convent."</p>

<p>The Superior replied:</p>

<p>"You hear, Charlotte De la Roque,
they have come to restore you to liberty.

<!-- page 203 col 1 -->

Do you persist in the resolution with
which you were inspired by the fearful
lesson which came to you from God's
hand? Do you wish to return to the
world? Speak the word, rise, go, you
are free!"</p>

<p>None of the sisters moved, and D'Auterive,
having somewhat regained his
composure, said:</p>

<p>"Is Charlotte present?"</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>"Who can assure me of it? Her
mother dwells within these walls; her
mother may think that the motive which
restores her daughter to liberty, will be
prejudicial to herself, and perhaps she
retains her here, to shield herself from
the justice of men."</p>

<p>"The baroness De la Roque," replied
the Superior, "has now to answer only
to the justice of God."</p>

<p>"We shall know how to tear her
from this house when the time arrives."</p>

<p>The Superior extended her hand, and
pointing toward one of the biers, she
said:</p>

<p>"Will you tear away yon corpse then,
and yonder coffin? There she lies, she,
whom you would deliver over to the
justice of men."</p>

<p>D'Auterive remained silent, and the
Superior continued:</p>

<p>"And now, Charlotte De la Roque,
since this man doubts of your presence
here, speak! what is your resolve?"</p>

<p>The nun who was kneeling at the
foot of the coffin, rose:</p>

<p>"Remove your veil," said the Superior.</p>

<p>Charlotte raised her veil. Four hours
passed in this house had added ten
years to her existence. A livid paleness
was spread over her features; her
eyes, red and swollen, had lost their soft
and limpid light; a feverish tremor
shook her lips and eye-lids, and gave
her the aspect of a woman upon the
verge of madness.</p>

<p>"You see, Charlotte," resumed the
Superior, "you have but to speak; no
force controls you; a magistrate, a kinsman,
a lover, are standing near you;
they will protect you; they will lead
you hence. Do you consent to accompany
them?"</p>

<!-- page 203 col 2 -->

<p>"No," replied Charlotte, in a gloomy
tone.</p>

<p>The criminal judge advanced, and
said to her:</p>

<p>"Do you refuse of your own free
will?"

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They have used neither prayers
nor threats?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But still," cried D'Auterive, impatiently,
"this new purpose must have a
motive."</p>

<p>Charlotte pointed towards her mother's
coffin, and replied:</p>

<p>"That is the motive which has dictated
my resolve. Say to the baron
De la Roque that his wife is dead, and
that her daughter will never aid him to
dishonor her memory."</p>

<p>"Charlotte!" cried Bernard, "have
you forgotten my love so quickly?"</p>

<p>"A love which plays the spy, which
accuses, which brands with shame. I
will never forget it, never, marquis De
Velay!"</p>

<p>Bernard resolved to appeal to every
tie, in order to bend her resolution, replied:</p>

<p>"But the comte Don Jos&eacute; De Frias
awaits you."</p>

<p>"I no longer know the comte De
Frias."</p>

<p>"What! your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marquis De Velay," said the Superior,
interrupting him, "mademoiselle
De la Roque has informed you that she
does not know the comte De Frias."</p>

<p>"I know none of you any longer,"
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>She dropped her veil, kneeled, and
leaning her head upon her mother's
coffin, renewed her prayers with fervor.</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive, have you no
other request to make?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, madam," replied D'Auterive,
"but I would venture to solicit
the favor of explaining this request
to yourself alone."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," replied the Superior,
"I wish that all that passes in this
house should be known to the sisters
who are confided to my care."</p>

<p>"But still," replied D'Auterive, "I
am unwilling to speak in the presence

<!-- page 204 col 1 -->

of these persons who have accompanied
me hither."</p>

<p>"Let those retire in whose presence
you are unwilling to impart this request."</p>

<p>D'Auterive turned. Beside the nuns,
there were present in the chapel, Pastourel,
Galidou, Bernard, and the criminal
judge.</p>

<p>"Well, it is no matter! these know
what I have to say to you," replied
D'Auterive, pointing to the three former,
"and as to you, worthy judge, it
will be necessary, doubtless, that you
should be informed of it, and it is as
well perhaps that you should be so now
as at a later period. Let all remain
then, for I am not one of those who
seek their vengeance by obscure intrigues;
that which I demand, I demand
aloud."</p>

<p>"Speak, then, comte D'Auterive,"
said the Superior.</p>

<p>"Well, madam, I have come here to
demand from you, both an asylum and
a prison for a woman who has failed in
her duties as a wife."</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?" asked the
duchess.</p>

<p>"The comtesse D'Auterive, madam."</p>

<p>"The comtesse D'Auterive!" replied
the Superior, while Bernard did not exhibit
the slightest emotion.</p>

<p>The Superior kept silence for a moment,
as if she expected to hear some
voice raised in remonstrance, and then
said:</p>

<p>"Does the comtesse D'Auterive consent
to enter this house?"</p>

<p>"I have not inquired her will on this
subject," said the comte. "She is
guilty, and if she refuses, the law will
do me justice; and it is for this reason
that I have requested the presence of
the criminal judge."</p>

<p>"But the comtesse D'Auterive may
maintain her innocence," said the Superior,
"and I cannot receive her until
she is found guilty, or has made a confession
of her fault."</p>

<p>"She will make this confession,"
said the comte, "rest assured of it madam,
for I have already that of her accomplice."</p>

<p>"And who is the wretch that thus
accuses and abandons a woman who

<!-- page 204 col 1 -->

has devoted herself to ruin for his sake?"
cried the duchess impetuously.</p>

<p>Bernard hung his head at these
words, which were uttered in a tone of
scorn, that could not be mistaken, although
the face of the speaker was covered
with a veil. A long silence followed
this question. The Superior
then resumed:</p>

<p>"I knew a wife who was more fortunate
than yours. Reproached by her
husband, she found in her lover a man
who dared to say to the injured spouse
that he would not suffer him to dishonor
her who bore his name. You know
this man and this woman, comte D'Auterive."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," said the comte.</p>

<p>"And deadly menaces and vows of
eternal hatred, passed between the husband
and the lover."</p>

<p>"It is true, madam."</p>

<p>"And still, when this woman had
voluntarily expiated her fault by retiring
from the world, this husband and
this lover, influenced by a common
interest, forgot, the one the injury
which he had received, the other, that
which he had inflicted, and to-day they
are bound in such ties of amity, that the
lover has been entrusted by the husband
with an office which clothes him with
his authority as a father."</p>

<p>No one replied, and the Superior
added with a vehemence that astonished
all present:</p>

<p>"You are all base and cowardly!"</p>

<p>"Madam!" cried Bernard.</p>

<p>The Superior hastily removed her
veil, and added:</p>

"It is I who say it, marquis De
Velay; it is I, your mother; it is I
who say, to you as I said to comte
D'Auterive, you are base and cowardly;
you display courage only against
women, whom you ruin, and then abandon
to infamy and despair. Comte
D'Auterive, you stand here as the representative
of the duke my husband,
the friendship which unites you is a
disgrace to him as well as to you.
Bernard De Velay, you have not a
word to utter in favor of the woman
whom you have professed to love; you
are the basest of mankind. Go! follow
out your plans of vengeance beyond

<!-- page 205 col 1 -->

these walls! the comtesse D'Auterive
shall not enter them until the day when
your testimony shall have proved her
guilt, and then justice shall be done
upon you both. So help me heaven!"</p>

<p>"My mother!" stammered Bernard.</p>

<p>"Enough, sir marquis," replied the
duchess De Nevers, "enough! And
now, marquis of Veroni, what is your
errand here?"</p>

<p>Galidou, vain and presumptuous as
he was, had not profited by the scene
which had just occurred, and he replied,
with his accustomed rudeness:</p>

<p>"I have come to request my mother,
Armande De Lostanges, to declare that
I am her son, and the son of your
brother, Giacomo Spaffa, prince of Puzzano."</p>

<p>"You were right, my brother," said
the duchess, "he has come to demand
his mother's dishonor. Well then,
wretch, question this corpse, and blessed
be God who has removed her from the
world so soon! blessed be God, who
did not hearken to the wild desire,
which tortured her departing spirit, who
did not suffer her dying eyes to gaze
upon thee! blessed be God, who has
spared her a bitter drop in her cup of
woe, who has spared her the fate of the
unhappy Paula, who listened while a
daughter's lips reproached her with her
fault, and demanded her dishonor!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried Charlotte, in a
piercing tone, "I am guilty! I have
committed this crime, and I will remain
here to expiate it&mdash;yes, yes, I have
killed her, killed my mother, and I have
merited the curse of God!"</p>

<p>"You can withdraw, sirs," said the
Superior, when this cry of remorse
had echoed through the chapel, "there
is still a woman to be ruined. You
must be impatient to complete the glorious
deed. Go! go!"</p>

<p>She then added:</p>

<p>"My brother, I am ready to listen to
you."</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say to you,
my sister," said Pastourel. "God
seems to have found no refuge for these
unhappy women, except by granting
them an asylum with him. It is only
beyond the grave that one is safe from
the malice of men?"</p>

<!-- page 205 col 2 -->

<p>"Repentance, my brother," said the
duchess, "deep and sincere repentance
is the only solace to the sufferer here.
Armande died, grieving over her lost
youth, over the joys of life, of which
her fault had robbed her; Paula perished,
smitten in her pride, which
would have concealed her error, even at
the price of her salvation.</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other had
entirely overcome the emotions and the
passions of the world. She, whose
hopes are placed in God alone, who,
confident in him, smiles, while the
malice of man blights her earthly joys,
and tramples her honor in the dust, she,
alone, is strong. Hence! and let no
one among you ever cross again the
threshold of this house!"</p>

<p>They went out, and the chapel was
closed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">PLOTTINGS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Pastourel left the chapel with
Galidou, Bernard, and the comte D'Auterive,
the latter expected to hear the
old man add some traits of his bitter
raillery to the scornful lesson which
they had just received from the duchess,
but he seemed to have entirely forgotten
them. They felt greatly relieved at his
silence. D'Auterive and Bernard had
good reason to blush, if he had reproached
them with the shameful compact, which
sealed at once their mutual forgiveness
and the ruin of the comtesse D'Auterive.
As for Galidou he had been
completely confounded in his brutal
projects of ambition, when he found
himself before the coffin of that mother
from whom he had come to require a
solemn declaration of her guilt.</p>

<p>Still when they saw Pastourel walk
onward without addressing a word to
either of them, without the slightest
manifestation of resentment, they became
suddenly alarmed; they knew
Giacomo too well, they thought, to
believe that this conduct was prompted
by indifference or disdain. They imagined
that he was leaving them to set

<!-- page 206 col 1 -->

on foot some secret project against
them; they hastened after him by a
common impulse, but without imparting
to each other their mutual fears.</p>

<p>Galidou was the first to break the
silence:</p>

<p>"Ha! cousin," he cried, turning to
Bernard, "whither can this old madman
be going without saying good day
or good evening."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" replied Bernard, displeased
at the tone in which he was
addressed, "I know little about it, and
care less."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, marquis," said
D'Auterive. "He is meditating some
trick of his trade, and probably one
of us will be the victim of it."</p>

<p>Bernard at once changed his tone,
suiting it to the rank of him who addressed
him, and replied:</p>

<p>"This man, I say it, although he is
my uncle, always has brought, and
always will bring misfortune to all connected
with him. Do you know that it
was he, who induced Charlotte to fly
with her father, the comte De Frias;
he then is the cause of all this mischief,
for if he had not urged her to take this
step, I should not have surprised her,
and the old baron de la Roque could not
have brought about these calamities."</p>

<p>"And which after all will be of no
use to him."</p>

<p>"You forget that he holds Don Jos&eacute;
in his hands."</p>

<p>"And what can he do with him,"
said Bernard.</p>

<p>"If he asks counsel of Pastourel,"
said Galidou, "the old Sorcerer will
teach him some villainy."</p>

<p>"It is certain that the prince's silence
is extraordinary," cried D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"He has left us without even looking
at us," said Bernard, "we must
beware."</p>

<p>"What harm can he do us?" said
comte D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>pardieu</i>," cried Galidou, "if
we knew that we should be as deep as
he."</p>

<p>"See how he quickens his pace," said
Bernard.</p>

<p>"I think he is trying to get back to
his den," cried Galidou, "when there,
he will laugh at us, with his trap doors,

<!-- page 206 col 2 -->

his secret passages, and his whole arsenal
of jugglery."</p>

<p>"True," said D'Auterive, "we were
caught there like rats in a trap."</p>

<p>"We can never deal with him except
on fair and open ground."</p>

<p>Neither Bernard nor D'Auterive replied;
their silence satisfied Galidou
that the proposal which these words
concealed had not startled them; he
paused, however, unwilling to say more,
and waited for his companions to advance
a step to meet him. Bernard
was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"Look there!" he cried suddenly,
"he turns to the left, he strikes into the
path to the ruins; we must know what
he is about to do there."</p>

<p>D'Auterive displayed still more clearly
how well he had comprehended Galidou's
thought, by exclaiming hastily:</p>

<p>"Take care! the criminal judge
cannot be far off."</p>

<p>Bernard and Galidou turned and beheld
at a distance the judge and his two
colleagues, pursuing the same road with
themselves.</p>

<p>"May the devil take them!" said
Bernard in an impatient tone.</p>

<p>"We must be prudent!" said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>Galidou appeared anxious for a moment,
and then cried:</p>

<p>"For all his nimble legs, and his
knowledge of the country, I could show
you a way which would lead us to the
ruins before he could reach them."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Bernard and D'Auterive
in one breath.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Galidou, "and if the
criminal judge has seen him turn to the
left, he will see us turn to the right, and
if necessary, he can testify that we have
followed the road opposite to that taken
by the old charlatan."</p>

<p>This reference to a testimony which
might exculpate them, displayed in all
its nakedness the project of violence,
which each secretly harbored against
Pastourel.</p>

<p>Giacomo's fate seemed sealed by the
projects of these three men; but a mere
turn in the conversation afforded him a
far better protection than his own skill
and courage could have done.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," said D'Auterive,

<!-- page 207 col 1 -->

"that this road will bring us there before
him?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Why, then, if Pastourel is in such
haste to regain his den, as you say,
why has he not taken it?"</p>

<p>"He probably does not know of it."</p>

<p>"Why not, since you have discovered
it?"</p>

<p>"I did not discover it; it was Catharine
who showed it to me, when we had
our little appointments in the wood.
For finding out secret roads, girls in
love are more cunning than thieves."</p>

<p>Bernard gazed at Galidou in astonishment,
and said:</p>

<p>"How! Catharine? the beautiful
Catharine?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Galidou, "and a
long time before you, marquis De Velay;
before she was the wife of Pierre Couteau.
Poor Pierre Couteau, he is another
dupe!"</p>

<p>Bernard laughed aloud, and D'Auterive
felt a cold sweat break out at every
pore of his body. He then muttered
between his closed teeth:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, the duchess was right!
I am base and cowardly!" He then
approached Bernard and exclaimed with
a violence that seemed bordering upon
madness:</p>

<p>"Hold! marquis De Velay! You
are a knave! One of us shall never
leave this spot."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the marquis, "what
the d&mdash;l is the matter now? what flea
has stung you? Have you likewise
been a lover of Catharine's, and would
you do for her what you have not done
for your wife?"</p>

<p>"I have profited by the lesson which
your mother gave me, marquis, and the
words of this boor have taught me all
the baseness of my conduct: you must
give me satisfaction on the spot."</p>

<p>"Willingly," said the marquis, "but
it is vexatious that in a place so retired
as this, we have but one witness of our
encounter."</p>

<p>"And so much the more so," said Galidou,
"since if the marquis De Velay
does not despatch you, I shall do myself
the honor to take his place, for
boors of my species are at least equal
to marquises of yours."</p>

<!-- page 207 col 2 -->

<p>"The judge is coming, and he can
serve as a second for us all," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"That is to say, arrest us, if he suspects
our project; you are mad, comte
D'Auterive!"</p>

<p>The latter did not reply, but began to
call with all his strength:</p>

<p>"Prince of Puzzano! prince of Puzzano!"</p>

<p>Giacomo looked around, and D'Auterive
made a signal for him to return.</p>

<p>Pastourel hesitated a moment, then
descending the mountain, the summit
of which he had almost reached, he
was in a few moments near those who
had called him.</p>

<p>While D'Auterive, Bernard and Galidou
however, stopped to wait for Pastourel,
the judge and his colleagues had
kept on their way, so that they reached
the group at the moment when Pastourel
joined it.</p>

<p>"Comte D'Auterive," said the judge,
"it is your intention, I suppose, to go
and inform the baron De la Roque of
that which has occurred at the convent?"</p>

<p>"It is probable that one of us will
do this errand," said D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"Which of you?" said the judge.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>," replied Bernard, in a careless
tone, "heaven only knows; I think
you would do well to go yourself, for
some of us may be prevented."</p>

<p>"I will go, Sir," said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"In that case," replied the judge,
"request the baron to inform me as
soon as possible, if, in the present state
of things, he intends to prosecute the
complaint which he has entered against
Don Jos&eacute; and mademoiselle De la
Roque."</p>

<p>"I will inform him of your request,"
replied Pastourel, "but I doubt whether
he will now carry that matter farther."</p>

<p>The judge did not reply. In the
long exercise of the duties of his office,
this man had acquired that admirable
indifference, which looks upon the
greatest crimes, the most terrible misfortunes
with no other interest than that
afforded by the employment which they
may render necessary. He turned to
D'Auterive, and said, with the most perfect
coolness:</p>

<!-- page 208 col 1 -->

<p>"I beg you, also, comte D'Auterive,
to inform me if you intend to enter the
complaint against the comtesse of which
you have spoken."</p>

<p>D'Auterive, who imagined that the
judge had divined the motive which
had induced him and his companions to
pause upon the road, replied moodily:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that question,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the judge, coolly
taking a pinch of snuff, "because I
must inform you that I shall not be at
home for a few days. We have made
up a hunting party at Mas, and <i>ma foi!</i>
a little relaxation once a year from the
vexations of office is not too much to
ask."</p>

<p>"You can hunt at your ease," replied
Bernard in a tone of raillery. "M.
D'Auterive has hit upon a better way
to avenge the injury which he has received."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut&mdash;marquis," said the judge,
"I ought not to know of these things;
but between ourselves the comte is right
in withdrawing his complaint, for these
affairs always produce scandal. Both
parties lose some honor by it."</p>

<p>"I beg you to spare us your advice,
sir judge," replied D'Auterive, "and
you can continue your road."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to offend you, nor
to give you advice, comte D'Auterive,"
said the judge quietly, "for, although I
can divine this better way, which you
have chosen to obtain your vengeance,
I do not think that you will act more
prudently in the one way than in the
other."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied the comte.</p>

<p>"It is a duel, is it not? you have
resolved upon a duel? Well, what
will you gain by it? if you slay your
wife's lover, she will hate you a little
the more, and if he slays you, you will
have served her wishes to a hair."</p>

<p>Bernard and Galidou laughed aloud,
and D'Auterive replied in fury:</p>

<p>"Do you know, sir, that I begin to
find your lessons and your counsels far
too impertinent, and that, judge though
you are, I could make you repent of it."</p>

<p>"M. D'Auterive," said the judge, in
the calmest tone imaginable. "I am

<!-- page 208 col 2 -->

the head of a family, and that which I
say is for your good."</p>

<p>He paused, and after an interval
during which the different actors in
this scene gazed at him inquisitively, to
learn the motive which could impel him
to meddle in an affair in which he had
no concern, he added, taking a large
pinch of snuff between his thumb and
fingers:</p>

<p>"Finally, comte D'Auterive, will you
permit me to ask you one favor?"</p>

<p>"Do it at once," said the comte.</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, if you are resolved
upon fighting, defer it for eight days,
or rather," he added, quickly, "fight out
of my district. <i>Ma foi!</i> if any one is
killed in the affair, I would rather that
one of my colleagues should be employed
to hold an inquest on the body,
and to draw up the minutes. <i>Ma foi!
ma foi!</i>" he cried warmly, "when a
man has but a single opportunity in a
year for recreation, it is unfair to disturb
him in it."</p>

<p>This conclusion so surprised the three
antagonists that they knew not what to
answer. Pastourel alone gazed at
this man with a kind of admiration.
Never in his opinion, had contempt
of human passions reached so
high a point.</p>

<p>"By what path," he said to himself,
"has this man been able to attain to
this state of supreme indifference?"</p>

<p>Still he did not address him, and the
judge was about to retire, saying to
D'Auterive:</p>

<p>"I count upon your kindness, M.
D'Auterive!" when from the height
which Pastourel had just descended, a
man was seen running in great haste
towards them; he uttered a cry when
he saw them, and made a sign that
they should wait for him. This man
was Pierre Couteau. What brought
him here? what was his errand? We
will inform the reader in due time.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>

<p class="small">DISCLOSURES.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the preceding chapters, we
left Jean Couteau escorting the comtesse
D'Auterive to her house, or rather to
the house of the marquis of Veroni,
where she lodged together with her
husband. On the other hand, it will
be remembered that when Bernard
repaired to the comte De Frias, he had
secured the means of his escape.
Lastly, the reader is aware, that after
the departure of Bernard, D'Auterive
and Galidou, Barati and the old baron
had remained together. We will now
inform him what had become of these
different persons, while the events,
which we have narrated, occurred at
the convent.</p>

<p>When the comtesse D'Auterive, still
stupefied by the tidings which she had
just heard concerning her birth, reached
the dwelling of Veroni with Jean Couteau,
a domestic said to her:</p>

<p>"What has become of the marquis?
There is some one here waiting for him
with the utmost impatience."</p>

<p>"Who?" said the comtesse, now
alarmed at the slightest incident.</p>

<p>"Ha, <i>pardieu!</i>" cried the domestic,
"it is neither more nor less than Catharine,
Jean Couteau's daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>"And what brings her here?" asked
the old hunter in a rough tone.</p>

<p>"She is waiting for the marquis,"
said the domestic.</p>

<p>"What business has she with him?"
rejoined Couteau with increasing anger.</p>

<p>"Your daughter-in-law!" said the
comtesse, "she is the daughter of a
certain Gali, is she not, whose son,
named Galidou, has disappeared from
the country."</p>

<p>"And who, as they pretend," said
Couteau, in a low voice, "is no other
than the marquis of Veroni."</p>

<p>"I am glad she is here," said the
comtesse, in the same tone, "perhaps
she knows something."</p>

<p>"About what?" rejoined Couteau.</p>

<p>Clemence did not at once reply;
presently she said:</p>

<p>"I wish to see her, I wish to question

<!-- page 209 col 2 -->

her. I thank you, Jean; you can
return."</p>

<p>"Madam, I should prefer taking
Catharine back to the house; this is
not the place for her."</p>

<p>"I must speak to her, I say. You
can wait for her if you please."</p>

<p>"I do not like this house well enough
either to leave my daughter-in-law here
or to wait for her."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied the comtesse,
quickly, "let Pierre Couteau come for
her; I should be very glad to speak
with him also."</p>

<p>"If that is the case, she can remain,"
said Jean, "since she will stay with
you until her husband comes for her.
Besides," he added, between his teeth,
"it is his affair."</p>

<p>Madam D'Auterive entered the house,
and sent word to Catharine that she
wished to speak with her. The peasant
woman scanned the comtesse with an
inquisitive scrutinizing glance, and although
the fatigue of her walk may
have disturbed her features, yet Catharine
felt at once convinced that this was
not the only cause of her agitation.</p>

<p>"What is your wish, madam?" she said.</p>

<p>"You are the daughter of Gali, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"It is no news, madam," replied
Catharine.</p>

<p>"You are married to Pierre Couteau?"</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed!" said Catharine, "that
is so of course, since I am called Catharine
Couteau."</p>

<p>"Your husband was a private in that
company of comte D'Auterive about
fifteen years ago."</p>

<p>"The comte can assure you of it."</p>

<p>"Catharine," said the comtesse, who
was beating the bush to start some hare
at random, "very strange things are
happening."</p>

<p>This stroke reached its aim, and
Catharine exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is the marquis of Veroni to espouse
mademoiselle De la Roque?"</p>

<p>A woman could not be mistaken as
to the meaning of this exclamation,
which came thus spontaneously from a
jealous heart. She gazed at Catharine
with a confidential air, and said, sinking
her voice:</p>

<p>"Galidou may call himself marquis

<!-- page 210 col 1 -->

of Veroni as much as he will, he is not
of a rank to obtain the daughter of the
baron De la Roque."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Catharine, in profound
astonishment, "do you know who he
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Catharine, and to prove it, I
will tell you what is passing."</p>

<p>She now informed her of the arrest
of Don Jos&eacute; and Charlotte, and of the
vengeance that the old baron had
resolved to take against his daughter or
against his wife.</p>

<p>Catharine listened quietly at this
recital, and, at last, replied:</p>

<p>"Well, then, you are as much interested
in this as I am, are you not,
madam, for you are as unwilling that
M. De Velay should espouse mademoiselle
Charlotte as I am that Galidou
should espouse her."</p>

<p>When women are led by no interest
to hate each other, they are wonderfully
frank as to their foibles, and madam
D'Auterive replied sadly:</p>

<p>"Oh, that is passed now! Let the
marquis De Velay marry whom he
pleases. I have something else to think
of."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Do you know who placed Galidou
in your father's hands?"</p>

<p>"Father Pastourel."</p>

<p>"And has no none ever been to see
him, during his absence?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, madam; a woman of
Toulouse, named Vergnes, came very
often on errands from Pastourel."</p>

<p>"Vergnes!" repeated the comtesse
D'Auterive, starting, "and do you
know what has become of this woman?"</p>

<p>"She must be dead; for it is a long
time since she has been seen here."</p>

<p>"A very long time?" said Clemence.</p>

<p>"Why, it is sixteen or seventeen
years," replied Catharine. "I remember
it, as if it was yesterday, for it was
she who told me that Galidou was not
my brother, add that was the cause
of my misfortune."</p>

<p>"And since then, you have not
heard of her?"</p>

<p>"Pierre Couteau, my husband, knows
all about the matter, madam, for he
told me&mdash;<i>ma foi!</i> what was it he told

<!-- page 210 col 2 -->

me? ah! I have forgotten.&mdash;But if I
am not mistaken, I hear his voice in
the court&mdash;he will inform you. Only,
as I made him believed was going to
the ruins, say to him that you had sent
for me, and that my errand to Pastourel's
was only a pretext to get here."</p>

<p>Pierre Couteau now entered, and
Catharine seeing from the air of vexation
which was visible in his face, that
he was but little pleased to find her
in this house, hastened to say:</p>

<p>"Here is madam D'Auterive, who
has sent for me, thinking that I could
give her some information respecting
the woman Vergnes; you must know
about her."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Pierre Couteau, "the
comtesse remembers then that we met
in her house, once."</p>

<p>"How?" cried madam D'Auterive,
"we have met at this woman's? Never!
never!"</p>

<p>Pierre mistook the emotion which
caused the comtesse to repel this
supposition so indignantly, and replied:</p>

<p>"Do not be angry, madam, do not
be angry. I do not mean to say that
you have ever frequented the den of
this old hag, but still you have been
there&mdash;and with me, with Pierre Couteau&mdash;on
the famous day of your father's arrest; you must remember it&mdash;the
famous day of the casket."</p>

<p>"It is true," said madam D'Auterive,
"and it was to the house of this
Vergnes that you led me? And was
this woman in the secret of the intrigues
which were plotted in her
house?"</p>

<p>"Of those, and many others."</p>

<p>"What others?"</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>ma foi!</i> I cannot tell you that,
but some of them must have concerned
you more nearly than you imagine."</p>

<p>"What ones?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what happened. It
was some time after your wedding with
comte D'Auterive; I had just married
Catharine also; well, one evening I
met mother Vergnes, as she was coming
from Toulouse, and as soon as she saw
me, she cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>pardieu!</i> I am glad to meet
you, Pierre Couteau; you must lead

<!-- page 211 col 1 -->

me to the house of the baron De la
Roque, your father's old master."</p>

<p>"And what business," I said, "have
you with the baron De la Roque?"</p>

<p>"Ah," she replied, "we are old acquaintances;
you ought to suspect it,
for you were in my house, when he
came there to meet with others concerning
the affairs of the protestants."</p>

<p>"Stay!" I said, "is that business
still going on?"</p>

<p>"Whether it is going on or not," replied
Rosine, "it is nothing to me now;
my time is up in this country; all the
others have drawn themselves safely out
of the business. But the master of all&mdash;you
remember the old man who
brought the casket&mdash;is about to leave the
country with his son, and as I should
be left without protection, I am going
to vanish also, and follow my husband
to Naples."</p>

<p>"Well, and what have you to say to
the baron De la Roque?"</p>

<p>"I have a little packet to place in his
hands."</p>

<p>"It must be very important, since
you have undertaken the journey yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>ma foi!</i>" replied Rosine, "I
would have gone twice the distance to
place this safely in the baron's hands,
if it but produces the result which I expect
from it."</p>

<p>"Madam," continued Pierre Couteau,
"we walked along, talking and
laughing, and, although I am by no
means curious, I could not help asking
myself, what this secret could be between
mother Vergnes and the baron,
and I said to her:</p>

<p>"You are greatly interested in it,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she replied, "if it is true that
you love the comte, as you always
boasted at Toulouse, it ought to interest
you also, for it concerns him very
closely."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then!" I said at once.</p>

<p>"Well then," she replied, "listen.
If ever old Barati, madam D'Auterive's
father&mdash;for he is her father&mdash;wishes to
annoy her, and consequently his son-in-law
with her, the Baron de la Roque will
have that in his hands, which can make
the old councillor shake in his shoes."</p>

<!-- page 211 col 2 -->

<p>"Bah!" I said to her, "and how so?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Pierre," she replied, "that is my
secret and Pastourel's."</p>

<p>"But why do you not place it in the
hands of the comte himself?"</p>

<p>"Because it concerns matters which
it is unnecessary for him to know, unless
father Barati makes mischief, and the
comte is not a man likely to resist the
desire of seeing its contents, if I should
place it in his hands, and tell him that
it concerned him."</p>

<p>"Are you more sure then of the
baron's discretion?"</p>

<p>"He is under our control," replied
Rosine; "he is well aware that we
know too much about his affairs."</p>

<p>"In this way we reached the baron's
house. Mother Vergnes went in, and
I waited for her, but she passed the
night there, and the next day she had
gone, no one knew whither."</p>

<p>"You did not see her again?"</p>

<p>"She knew too much, madam; the
baron was not anxious to let her speak
to any one."</p>

<p>"And have you related this to
my husband?" said madam D'Auterive.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> madam, I have scarcely
thought of it for these fourteen years,
and if you had not asked me about
this woman, I should not have thought
of it now."</p>

<p>Clemence now called to mind the
words of Pastourel, concerning the inquest,
which would prove that the
councillor had adopted a suppositious
child in order to obtain the property of
the family of Lostanges, and she no
longer doubted that the baron was the
depositary of this secret.</p>

<p>"Pierre Couteau," she said, "it is
useless for you to speak of this affair to
my husband, but you must conduct me
at once to the baron's."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, madam, I am at your
service; but here is Catharine who will
answer as well."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" said Catharine, "I have
run about enough to-day."</p>

<p>"Enough&mdash;to rest here, ha! and to
wait for Galidou?" cried Pierre with a
scowl.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their presence of
mind, the two women exchanged a

<!-- page 212 col 1 -->

glance, and madam D'Auterive hastened
to reply:</p>

<p>"Catharine has nothing to say to the
marquis of Veroni, and I am sure that
she will accompany us."</p>

<p>"Accompany us?" said Pierre.</p>

<p>"Accompany me, if you will not go
with us, although it is perhaps imprudent
for two women to venture across
the fields in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we will both go with
you."</p>

<p>In a few moments, Pierre Couteau
and his wife, together with madam
D'Auterive, took the road which led
to the mansion of the baron De la
Roque.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XL.</p>

<p class="small">CONCLUSION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the reader will calculate the time
and the course of events, he will observe
that Clemence returned from the
ruins, escorted by Jean Couteau, while
her husband, Bernard and Galidou
were retracing their steps to the baron's.
The interview which she had just had
with Catharine and Pierre, took place
while her husband and his companions
were at the mansion, so that they had
already left it, when she resolved to repair
thither. Barati and the Baron de
la Roque therefore had remained for
some time alone.</p>

<p>It was during this interval that the
following scene occurred.</p>

<p>"Well then, baron!" said Barati,
"you hold your vengeance in your
hands?"</p>

<p>"And you are still awaiting yours,"
replied the baron.</p>

<p>"Mine cannot escape me."</p>

<p>"It may be so, it may be so, master
Barati; but it may cost you so dear, that
it will be vengeance no longer. I set
no store by those victories for which
one pays with his life, and I am not one
of those who would toss his enemy
from a window, at the risk of following
him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, baron?"</p>

<p>"I know your plan, master Barati;

<!-- page 212 col 2 -->

you purpose to have the restoration of
the prince of Puzzano revoked, and to
compel him to prove that Galidou is not
a suppositious child."</p>

<p>"Do you think he can prove it?"</p>

<p>"You are a skilful advocate, master
Barati, but you are not the man to contend
against old Pastourel. He was
mocking you in the ruins, when he appeared
to fear your accusation; he
cares as little for it as he does for his
old shoes."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Because there exists
a regular certificate of the birth of
the said Galidou, whom he has recognized
as his son."</p>

<p>"We will attack the certificate."</p>

<p>"It will be still better defended."</p>

<p>"And by whom?"</p>

<p>"By the duke De Nevers in the first
place, and then by me."</p>

<p>"By you?"</p>

<p>"By me! I signed it."</p>

<p>"When and how?" exclaimed Barati,
"it is impossible! The first time I
entered your castle&mdash;I remember it very
well&mdash;you had not the slightest suspicion
that Galidou was the Prince's son,
for you would have shut him up with
an old wolf, and if I heard rightly certain
words of Don Jos&eacute;'s, he promised
to a certain man, named Jean Couteau,
two hundred crowns in your name, if
he would rid you of Pastourel."</p>

<p>"You have an excellent memory,
councillor, but you do not go far enough
back. I knew the prince of Puzzano at
the time of his sister's marriage with
the duke De Nevers, and at the time
when the contract was signed, and
when you played so silly a part. It
was nine months after, master Barati,
that he brought a new born infant to
Mirepoix, and had it christened as his
son, I being present as a witness with
the comte De Frias and the duke De
Nevers, his brother-in-law. And do
you know what precautions he took to
protect this child in his rights? He
entailed all his wealth upon the said
duke De Nevers, but in the case only
that he himself should be restored to his
rights, and could thus possess it; but
in order that the duke, of whose character
he had formed a just estimate,

<!-- page 213 col 1 -->

should not profit unfairly by this entailment,
he added a second condition,
namely, that the child should live and
be placed in possession of his property
and his title. Now, you are too skilful,
master Barati, not to know that this
precaution is common in entailments,
and recognized in all the courts of law,
and you are too well acquainted with
the duke De Nevers not to know that
he will make every effort to establish
Galidou in his rights."</p>

<p>"You were aware of all this, and
still would have cast the son of the
prince of Puzzano to an old wolf?"</p>

<p>"I knew all this, master; I even
knew that the child could be recognized
by a cross which had been marked upon
his left side; but after having taken all
these precautions, Giacomo carried him,
I know not whither. It was about a
year after this, that Gali came to establish
himself, with his wife and one child
at Lavelanet. How the devil would
you have me think that this child was
the prince's son? Giacomo did not
make his appearance for many years,
and I was far enough from suspecting
twenty years after that the shepherd
Pastourel was the prince himself."</p>

<p>"But where is this certificate of
birth?" said Barati.</p>

<p>"I will tell you presently, master
Barati, when you have promised me a
little favor."</p>

<p>"And what favor?"</p>

<p>"That in the trial which is soon to
be commenced, you will testify, that, on
the day when I imprisoned you in the
dungeon, the baroness came to seek you
there, and acknowledged her guilt, demanding
your aid to enable her to escape
my vengeance."</p>

<p>"It is perjury that you require of me,
baron."</p>

<p>"What is, that you require of me,
when you wish me to tell you where
this certificate of birth is to be found?"</p>

<p>"I ask a simple truth."</p>

<p>"Which would soon be nothing more
than a lie, for if you knew where this
certificate was, you would probably find
means to remove it."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Barati, "give me
your word of honor, that you will tell

<!-- page 213 col 2 -->

me where this certificate is deposited,
and I will testify what you wish."</p>

<p>"It is not words in the air that I ask
of you, master Barati, but a testimony
written and certified by your own
hand."</p>

<p>"I am ready to draw it up, but you
will tell me where this certificate is to
be found?"</p>

<p>"I have promised."</p>

<p>"Well then, dictate, baron. I will
write."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the baron, "your
evidence will be of great weight, for
you pass for an honest man."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the tone of insolence
in which these words were spoken, Barati
did not reply; he began to write,
at the baron's dictation, the declaration
which he had required of him.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished when a domestic
brought word that the comtesse
D'Auterive wished to speak with her
father.</p>

<p>"Why not let her enter here," said the
baron, addressing Barati: "She must
have some news for us, by her coming
in the middle of the night. Besides,"
added the baron, "I have a slight favor
to ask of her."</p>

<p>"As you please, baron," said the old
councillor.</p>

<p>When the comtesse entered, she was
greatly surprised to find herself in the
baron's presence, and by a sign gave
her father to understand that she wished
to speak with him, but the latter said at
once:</p>

<p>"Do you not advance to salute your
uncle, my daughter?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, in truth," said the baron,
"and much more certainly my niece,
than she is your daughter."</p>

<p>The comtesse gazed upon her father,
who said to her:</p>

<p>"He knows all."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam D'Auterive, but I am
a good fellow at heart, and if you will
be somewhat obliging toward me, you
shall not repent of it."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, sir?" said
Clemence.</p>

<p>"Will you read to me that scrap of
paper which your father has just written."</p>

<!-- page 214 col 1 -->

<p>Madam D'Auterive read it, and the
baron then said:</p>

<p>"That is right; you have acted like
an honest man, master Barati; pardon
my suspicions, but when one is blind,
it is not easy to know what has been
written."</p>

<p>This remark inspired the comtesse
with a sudden thought.</p>

<p>"Give me the paper, my niece," said
the baron.</p>

<p>The comtesse made a sign to her
father, and at the same moment placed
a different paper in the hands of the
baron, who took it and folded it, saying
to Clemence:</p>

<p>"And now, my niece, take a taper,
and follow me. We have no need of
you, master Barati. I wish to make my
niece a present. I wish to surprise her."</p>

<p>They traversed various apartments,
and stopped at last in a chamber, in
which stood a high chest of drawers,
covered and riveted with iron; he
opened it, and said to the comtesse:</p>

<p>"Do you not see upon the second
shelf, to the right, a small sealed
packet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Take it, and read the superscription."</p>

<p>She read:</p>

<p>"To be placed in the hands of the
comtesse D'Auterive."</p>

<p>"That is it; conceal this packet, my
niece, and henceforth laugh at the
threats of Pastourel."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu!</i>" cried the comtesse,
"it is the packet that was placed in
your hands by Rosine."</p>

<p>"You knew of it?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You know then that it contains the
affidavit that Giacomo compelled your
mother to sign, attesting that you are
Vergnes' daughter and hers, and not the
daughter of Barati?"</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Well then, my niece, say nothing
of the matter to your father. He must
not think that he is safe against the
inquest which would destroy him as
well as you."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"You will see; come!"</p>

<p>They returned to the apartment

<!-- page 214 col 2 -->

where they had left Barati, and the
latter said to the baron:</p>

<p>"And now you will tell me where
this certificate is deposited?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" replied the baron, in a
tone of mockery, "I have been delighted
with my niece, and I have reflected
upon what passed at the ruins. If you
undertake any thing against Galidou,
Pastourel will requite you by disclosing
the secret of Clemence's birth; that
would destroy this good comtesse, and
it would dishonor my nephew. I think
that it would be more prudent to tell
you nothing, for your own sake, for you
would only lose by it."</p>

<p>"These were not our terms," replied
the councillor, "and you have given
me your word of honor to tell me
where the certificate of Galidou's birth
is deposited."</p>

<p>"It is true! it is true!" said the
baron, in a tone of mockery, "and I
always keep my word, but I now remember
that I promised the prince of
Puzzano to say nothing about it until
you were dead. I will keep my first
promise, but at the same time I swear
to you that as soon as you are buried, I
will come to your grave, and tell you
where this certificate is to be found."</p>

<p>"After what I have just done for
you, baron, your conduct is infamous."</p>

<p>"What conduct is infamous toward
the man who has written and signed a
falsehood?"</p>

<p>"I hope, that that which I have
written and signed may serve you in
your plans of vengeance," replied Barati
with a sneer.</p>

<p>"What is that?" cried M. De la
Roque, quickly, "has he followed us?
has he robbed me of that paper?"</p>

<p>"I have given you another, a different
paper," said Clemence.</p>

<p>"Theft! murder! help!" roared the
baron, "this man and woman have
robbed me, pillaged me! seize them!&mdash;Murder!"
he cried, darting upon Barati,
and grasping him by the throat.</p>

<p>At these frightful cries, the domestics
rushed in on all sides, and among
them Don Jos&eacute;, who having heard
of Bernard's departure for the convent,
did not doubt but that he would bring
Charlotte back with him, and was

<!-- page 215 col 1 -->

waiting near the house for her return.
Pierre Couteau and Catharine entered
also.</p>

<p>"Free me from this furious madman!"
cried Barati, struggling beneath
the baron's grasp.</p>

<p>"Seize him! seize him!" cried M.
De la Roque, in an ungovernable rage,
"he is a robber! he has robbed his
daughter!"</p>

<p>Don Jos&eacute;, hurried beyond the bounds
of prudence, at the sight of these old
men struggling in desperate conflict,
raised his voice, and said:</p>

<p>"Seize your master! he will slay
this man!"</p>

<p>At the sound of this voice, the baron
paused, but without loosing his hold of
Barati, whom he held by his neckcloth,
beneath which he had wound his hand.</p>

<p>"Is that Don Jos&eacute; De Frias?" he
cried.</p>

<p>"It is, baron De la Roque."</p>

<p>"And you all conspire then to deceive
me? Well then! this man shall
pay me first."</p>

<p>With herculean strength, he dragged
Barati to the table, and took from it a
long, sharp knife. Frias rushed upon
the baron, crying:</p>

<p>"Hold! hold!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the baron, uttering a
savage cry, "I have caught thee, Don
Jos&eacute;!"</p>

<p>And at once, turning from Barati, he
plunged the knife into Don Jos&eacute;'s
heart, and stretched him dead at his
feet. But in the midst of the tumult,
all struggling together, Barati had succeeded
in cocking one of the pistols
which he had carried with him to the
ruins, and at the moment when the
baron turned from him to strike Don
Jos&eacute;, he discharged it; the ball entered
his loins, and scarcely had Frias fallen,
when the baron dropped dead at his
side.</p>

<p>All rushed upon Barati, seized him,
and he was confined by the baron's domestics
in a chamber on the ground floor.</p>

<p>During the first few hours after these
events, the castle was a scene of confusion.
The comtesse durst not, and
could not give orders in her uncle's
house, and against her father; and
at break of day Catharine despatched

<!-- page 215 col 2 -->

her husband to the convent of Saint
Benoit, to bring the criminal judge, and
those who might be with him.</p>

<p>The tidings brought by Pierre Couteau
was of a nature to effect a total
change in the hostile views of comte
D'Auterive. Bernard at once placed
him at his ease.</p>

<p>"This is a serious affair, comte," he
said, "and if you wish time to arrange
it, I will hold myself in readiness for
any day that you find convenient."</p>

<p>"I will do the same," said Galidou.</p>

<p>"I accept your proposal, M. De Velay,"
said the comte. "As for you,
marquis of Veroni, I beg you to forget
an expression for which my anger
offers some excuse; I remember, I am
your guest."</p>

<p>Galidou bowed, and D'Auterive
turned to Pierre Couteau, who was
saying to the judge:</p>

<p>"But where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Home."</p>

<p>"Have you not heard me? I tell
you that there have been two murders
committed."</p>

<p>"Two murders!" cried the judge,
"two murders! There have been two
murders committed?"</p>

<p>He repeated these words three or
four times in succession, and with increasing
irritability, and then exclaimed
with a gesture of anger:</p>

<p>"<i>Sacredie!</i> is it written then that
they shall hunt and eat the pasty without
me?"</p>

<p>Then turning to his colleagues, he
said:</p>

<p>"To our duty then, gentlemen, and
since they force me to it, wo to those
who fall into my hands!"</p>

<p>With these words he pursued his
way with a resolute step; Pastourel
approached him, accosted him, and
walked onward at his side, apparently
endeavoring to soothe him. In the
meanwhile D'Auterive called to Pierre
Couteau, and inquired concerning the
slightest particulars of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"So then," he said, "after he had
questioned him, the comtesse returned
to the baron's, after you told her that
story respecting Rosine, and did you
learn nothing of what passed between
them?"</p>

<!-- page 216 col 1 -->

<p>"I have told you, sir; when we
rushed in, the baron was crying 'theft!
robbery!' and the rest passed like lightning."</p>

<p>"Well!" said the comte, "you need
not speak either of Rosine, or of the
packet."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> I promise to be silent,"
said Pierre, "but Catharine was present,
and if she takes it into her head to
prate, nobody in the world can stop
her."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" cried D'Auterive, "it
would be terrible!" Then after reflecting
a moment, he added, "well, I will
silence her!"</p>

<p>"By what means?" said Couteau.</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the comte, "do not
concern yourself about that; that is my
affair."</p>

<p>Pierre Couteau did not appear pleased
to find that M. D'Auterive possessed a
power over his wife, which he was unable
to exert, and he racked his brains
to discover the means, by which Catharine
could be prevented from prating.&mdash;In
his opinion, it must be something
dreadful, some secret of his wife's, and
the suspicions which he harbored against
her, returned with redoubled force.</p>

<p>By this time, Bernard and Galidou
had reached a spot where the road divided.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to the baron's?"
said Bernard to Galidou.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do there," replied
the latter, "and I do not care to be mingled
up in these murders; besides, I
suppose I shall find some one at home
who will inform me of all that has
passed."</p>

<p>He saluted Bernard, and hurrying
onward, overtook Pastourel and the
judge, and he said to his father:</p>

<p>"I wish to speak a word with you, sir."</p>

<p>"It is entirely useless," replied Pastourel.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me, father," said
Galidou, in a more humble tone, "that
Barati's threats are of such a nature, that
we should take precautions against
them."</p>

<p>"These precautions have been taken
long since," said Pastourel. "I have
just explained to the judge, the manner
in which they were taken, and the place

<!-- page 216 col 2 -->

where the documents will be found
which will secure your rights."</p>

<p>"Yes, marquis of Veroni," said the
judge, bowing with an air which assured
Galidou that the magistrate was convinced
of the validity of the title by
which he addressed him, "these documents
will be placed in your hands by
me, whom monseigneur has been so
kind as to entrust with the charge of
this affair."</p>

<p>"But Barati's accusation?" rejoined
Galidou.</p>

<p>"It is that of a madman," said Pastourel.
"Is it not true, comte D'Auterive,"
said the prince, raising his voice,
"that master Barati has for some time
been laboring under mental derangement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, in truth," said the comte,
who divined the way thus opened by
the prince to make the best of the affair,
"and since yesterday we have been
trying to contrive some means to prevent
the misfortunes which might result
from his madness. Alas! we thought
of it too late, and hence this sad catastrophe."</p>

<p>"You declare, then," said the judge,
"that M. Barati is mad, actually mad?"</p>

<p>"The fact is undoubted."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the judge, "I
need only arrest him, and I do not see
why I should not defer the examination
to some future day, by declaring that
he is not in a condition to answer."</p>

<p>"It will be perfectly right," replied
Pastourel.</p>

<p>"Very well! very well!" said the
judge, quickening his pace, "all can be
arranged admirably. But let us despatch,
for I must return to Foix this
evening, if I would reach Mas in time
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And they will not eat the pasty
without you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" replied the judge, with a
wise air, "you may jest as much as you
please, monseigneur, but the pasty is
composed of ducks' livers with truffles."</p>

<p>Pastourel's admiration at this answer
under circumstances so serious, prevented
him from replying. Besides it suited
his projects that the judge should admit
Barati's madness without an examination;
he did not add another word

<!-- page 217 col 1 -->

but departed in the direction of the ruins.
Bernard, unwilling to remain alone with
D'Auterive, resolved to follow Galidou,
and the comte continued his way with
Pierre Couteau, the judge and his colleagues.
They reached the mansion of
the baron De la Roque at so late an
hour, that the judge had but little time
to draw up his minutes. The comtesse,
ignorant that her husband was informed
of her <i>liaison</i> with Bernard, related all
that had passed with the most unsuspecting
confidence.</p>

<p>D'Auterive found no difficulty in persuading
her to testify that her father's
reason had for a long time been deranged,
and she gave evidence to that effect
before the judge. D'Auterive confirmed
her statement; but when they sought
for witnesses to prove the manner in
which the two murders had been committed,
Catharine and Pierre Couteau
were not to be found. The comtesse
declared that Catharine had left the
house, as soon as her husband had set
out for the mountain, and several of
domestics said that Pierre Couteau, having
asked for his wife upon his return,
and not having found her, had exclaimed
"Oh! I know where she must be,
the jade!" and then at once hurried
from the house, taking the road toward
the abode of the marquis of Veroni.</p>

<p>We will leave the judge to draw up
and complete his minutes at his leisure;
we will accompany neither Pierre Couteau
nor Galidou, but will follow Jean
Couteau on his way to the ruins on the
ensuing morning. The old hunter
walked onward with drooping head, as
if sunk in deep affliction. Having
crossed the remains of the drawbridge,
he went directly to the lower hall which
Pastourel occupied, and found it deserted;
he called aloud, but no one answered;
he whistled, in hopes that Greyfoot
would make his appearance, and lead
him to his master, but it was in vain.</p>

<p>He then slowly left the ruins, but as
the fatigue which he had undergone,
together with the grief which seemed to
overpower him, had exhausted his
strength, he sat down upon a stone at
some distance from the bridge.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he taken his seat when
the earth seemed to tremble beneath his

<!-- page 217 col 2 -->

feet; every thing around him shook and
tottered, and a violent explosion was
heard; the ruins of the castle, some
towers of which had survived the conflagration,
seemed to rock for a moment
upon their base, and then fell with a
fearful din, while a vast sheet of fire
mounted aloft, hurling far and wide
large masses of stone, some of which
dropped at the feet of the old huntsman.</p>

<p>Jean Couteau, greatly terrified, started
up, and took to flight, convinced that
it was the devil who had blown up the
castle of La Roque, and that Pastourel
was buried beneath its ruins, but on
turning to cast a last glance at the
frightful spectacle, he beheld the sorcerer
himself, crossing the rubbish at a
quick step and coming towards him.</p>

<p>Jean was on the point of resuming
his flight, but he stopped at the sound
of Pastourel's voice; as he called to him.
He waited, and Giacomo approaching
him, said:</p>

<p>"God be praised for having saved
you, Jean! Had you entered the castle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I called after you, but to
no purpose."</p>

<p>"I had betaken myself to a safe
place," replied Pastourel, "while I accomplished
the last act of justice which
remains to me on earth."</p>

<p>"Whom have you buried beneath
the ruins?"</p>

<p>"No one; but I have destroyed the
immense wealth which I had accumulated
during many years, and which
was concealed in the caverns of this
mountain. I am unwilling that it should
fall into the hands of a son who has
proved himself unworthy of it. Stay,
Jean, here is a letter which will inform
him that I have deprived him of those
riches which have rendered him so
proud and so vain."</p>

<p>Pastourel reached the letter to Couteau,
who refused it, and turned aside
his head.</p>

<p>"Will you not render me this service,
Jean?"</p>

<p>"He to whom the letter is addressed,"
replied the old hunter, "can no
longer read it."</p>

<p>"What mean you?"</p>

<p>"I knew it would be so Pastourel!"

<!-- page 218 col 1 -->

replied Jean. "I have often
told Catharine that some misfortune
would come of it."</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, Pastourel, I came to
tell you about it, for there is no one but
you who can save him."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Pierre, my son."</p>

<p>"What has he done?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday he missed Catharine at
the baron De la Roque's, and suspecting
where she was, he went to look for
her. Catharine had supposed that the
affair of the two murders would detain
him all night at the castle; Pierre
entered the house of the marquis of
Veroni, forced open the door, made his
way into the chamber, where he found
him with Catharine, and without thinking
of anything but the injury which
had been done him, he struck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His wife?"</p>

<p>"No! the marquis, the <i>fillou</i>."</p>

<p>"Has he killed him?"</p>

<p>"Killed him!" repeated Jean Couteau.</p>

<p>"And you have come to ask me to
save him? me! me!"</p>

<p>"Hearken, Pastourel," replied Jean,
"he was in the right; he had honor
and courage; he is not like the comte
D'Auterive who had made up matters
with the marquis De Velay."</p>

<p>"He has forgiven the comtesse,
then?" said Pastourel.</p>

<p>"The comtesse departed this morning
for the convent of Saint Benoit."</p>

<p>"She also?" said Pastourel, "the
wife and the mistress both expiating
their faults beneath the same roof.
There is then a divine justice!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jean, "and if you believe
in it, you will save Pierre."</p>

<p>"But where is he at present?"</p>

<p>"Shut up in the same prison with
the madman."</p>

<p>"What madman?"</p>

<p>"The old councillor. His daughter
has testified that he is deranged, his
son-in-law has done the same, and they
have put chains upon his feet and
hands, as they have upon poor Pierre's
likewise."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Pastourel, "they have
well profited by the counsel I gave

<!-- page 218 col 2 -->

them. Come, Jean, come! if I can yet
do anything in this world, I will do it,
I will do it for you; you, the only
honest man that I have found in this
country. Come!"</p>

<p>Pastourel and Jean now walked together
toward the mansion of La Roque.
They found the associate judges still
there, to whom the judge had entrusted
the keeping of the two prisoners.</p>

<p>These had heard the judge call Pastourel
"monseigneur," and they readily
allowed him admission into the
chamber in which Pierre Couteau and
Barati were confined.</p>

<p>As he entered, the latter shook his
chains, and cried:</p>

<p>"Ah! Giacomo! justice has been
done; and you see by what hands it
has been accomplished. You have
come to put the murderer to the rack,
and to hand him over to the headsman.
Go, go, that will not bring back your
son!"</p>

<p>Pastourel did not reply.</p>

<p>"Pierre Couteau," he said, "take my
pilgrim's robe, conceal your face as you
go out, and hasten to join your father,
who is waiting for you."</p>

<p>"What! is it you who save me?" said
Pierre.</p>

<p>"Begone! and do not question me,"
said Pastourel. "I must remain alone
with this man."</p>

<p>Pastourel removed Couteau's chains,
and gave him his pilgrim's robe.</p>

<p>The associate judges who knew that
the marquis of Veroni was Pastourel's
son, were far from imagining that the
father would aid in the escape of the
murderer. They suffered Pierre to
pass therefore unquestioned, and Barati
and the prince of Puzzano were left
alone.</p>

<p>Barati had not spoken from the moment
when he saw Pastourel assisting
Pierre to make his escape. A strange
terror had seized him. In the contests
which he had sustained against this
man, he had so often seen events turn
to the advantage of his foe, that he
imagined that Pastourel would not have
visited his prison, except to inflict some
new torture upon him. He did not
speak until they were alone, when he
said:</p>

<!-- page 219 col 1 -->

<p>"Well, Giacomo, and what have you
yet to say to me?"</p>

<p>"You are avenged, Barati&mdash;Armande
is dead, and this man has slain
her son and mine."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;are not you avenged,
Giacomo? They are going to condemn
me to end my days in a mad
house?"</p>

<p>"Barati, do you regret nothing that
you have done?"</p>

<p>Barati was silent.</p>

<p>"These misfortunes, these calamities,
which follow each other with such fearful
rapidity, do they not declare to you
that the time for repentance has arrived?"</p>

<p>Barati gazed steadfastly at Pastourel,
who, with his head buried in his hands,
seemed sunk in the deepest dejection;
then, after a moment's silence, he replied:</p>

<p>"You can repent&mdash;God will give you
time&mdash;but I, how can I?"</p>

<p>"You can, if you are sincere," said
Pastourel. "I shall retire into the
convent of La Trappe."</p>

<p>"Ah! I should he too happy, could
I but follow you thither, for I confess I
am terrified at the confinement with
which I am threatened; my reason, I
am convinced, will give way, and in a
few months the falsehood of comte
D'Auterive will be a truth."</p>

<!-- page 219 col 2 -->

<p>"Well, then," said Pastourel, "may
God enlighten you, and enable you to
become reconciled to him. You shall
be freed!"</p>

<p>"Freed?" cried Barati.</p>

<p>"I will remove your chains, as I have
removed Pierre's, and we can easily
elude the vigilance of our keepers, who,
thinking that their prisoners are chained,
will not watch very carefully at the
door. Besides, this chamber must have
another way of egress."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" said Barati, as Pastourel
with a cutlass opened the padlock
which fastened his chains, "thanks,
Giacomo! God will recompense thy
generosity in the next world, and thus
requite it in this!"</p>

<p>With these words, he snatched the
cutlass from the hands of Pastourel,
plunged it in his breast, and laid him
dead at his feet.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, when the judges
entered the chamber, Barati was seated
upon the corpse of his enemy, laughing,
and rocking to and fro, muttering incoherent
and unmeaning words. His
wandering eye, his bristly hair, the
contraction of the features, gave him an
aspect truly terrible. Barati was mad!
His reason had yielded to the savage
joy which his vengeance had brought
to him. Each of these two men had
received his punishment.</p>
