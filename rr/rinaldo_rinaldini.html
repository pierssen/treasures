<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

</div>

<p>THE uncommon celebrity on the continent, of the
work of which the following is a translation, and the
numerous and ornamented editions of it with which
Germany is teeming, would not have been sufficient
motives for the present Editor to unite his name with
it, had it been a mere imaginary romance; nor did he
undertake the translation, however pleasing and interesting
the narrative appeared to him, till he had the
fullest assurance, private as well as public, of the authenticity
of the principal facts.</p>

<p>It further appeared to the translator, that independent
of the various moral instruction to be derived from
the biography of celebrated and singular characters,
the ensuing narrative was particulary valuable,
because it is there evident, that the most commanding
of all talents, and those which give an individual most
power either to benefit or injure mankind, are energy
and promptitude of mind.</p>

<p>The Editor was also desirous of showing certain pretended
translators that is possible to render Colloquial
German into Colloquial <i>English;</i> which from the innumerable
wretched performances he has perused,
under the title of translations, especially works of
that class, might almost have been conceived impracticable.</p>

<p>These considerations, and the greatness of mind
displayed by the hero of the tale, were additional motives,
which overcame his aversion to avowing a production
which the philosopher and the man of learning
may probably still consider as trifling.</p>

<p>The German author, who has presented in such interesting
points of view the life and adventures of this

<!-- page iv -->

extraordinary man,* at first modestly concealed his
name; but the uncommon eagerness of his countrymen
to know to whom they were indebted for facts so
judiciously collected and arranged, and related in so
pleasing a manner, has at last discovered him. He
has introduced his work by a preface to the following
effect: </p>

<p class="small">[*Rinaldo Rinaldini lived in the former part of the last
century.]</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>ALL Italy speaks of him.&mdash;The Appenine mountains,
and the Sicilian vales resound with the name of Rinaldini.
It lives in the songs of Florence and Calabria and
in the ballads of the Sicilians.&mdash;From the summit of the
Alps to the extremity of the Appenines, men talk of his
achievements; and when the garrulous villagers of Calabria
assemble in the evening before their doors, every
one is ready to relate some adventure of the Valeroso
Capitano Rinaldini. It is a pleasure to witness the
eagerness and emulation they express.</p>

<p>The Shepherds of the Sicilian vales alternately entertain
each other with stories of him; and the simple
peasant, though exhausted by the heat and labour of
the day, seems reanimated the moment he begins to
talk of Rinaldini, amid a circle of his acquaintance.
Wives and maidens, young men and boys, all listen
with delight, when their fathers and husbands speak
of him. Nor does sleep oppress their eyes, if their labours
be but enlivened with the story of Rinaldini. He
is the hero of the soldier's tale in the guard room, or
the lonely watch-tower upon the coast; and of seafaring
men when unwillingly detained on shore, or
becalmed on the ocean. Hills and vallies, spinning
rooms and cottages, alike resound with ballads of Rinaldini.&mdash;Here
then follows the history of this extraordinary
man, in which the adventures related of him

<!-- page vi -->

are collected together, and arranged to the proper order
of time; and if the tale be but half so pleasing to
my readers, and excite in them but half so lively an
interest as among the inhabitants of Calabria, of Florence,
and of Rome, though they may have taken it
up but to gratify curiosity, or chase away the dull
moments of slow paced time, they will not lay it down
dissatisfied:&mdash;such at least is my proudest wish.</p>

<p>HISTORY</p>

<p>OF</p>

<h3>RINALDO RINALDINI,</h3>

<p>CAPTAIN OF BANDITTI.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THE boisterous winds rolled over the Appenines
like the mountain-waves of the ocean; and
the aged oaks bowed their lofty heads to the
storm. Rinaldo and Altaverde had kindled a
fire beneath a projecting rock, and sat sheltered
in a narrow dell. The night was dark, thick
clouds concealed the moon and no cheering star
twinkled in the heavens.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. This stormy night exceeds every
thing I have ever witnessed! Rinaldo! are you
not asleep?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I sleep! I like such weather: it
rages here and there, around us, close to us, in
this breast of mine, and every where!</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Captain, you are no longer the same
man you were.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis true. Once I was an innocent
boy: but now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. You are in love.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am a captain of Banditti.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Has your cara sposa found it
out? When you appear in great towns and

<!-- page 8 -->

cities, who but takes you for one of the richest
noblemen, and of the most ancient house?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And yet a price is set upon my
head!</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. And who will earn it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps one of my own band.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. For shame! They who have
sworn fidelity to you, will never be guilty of
such an action.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh! they are men, and bad men.
Good you cannot, by heavens! call one of us.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. On that we shall differ. But
you are in a bad humour. Will you drink?&mdash;No.
Well, then I'll drink alone. What boots
it now, to lament and grumble? Now it is too
late.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Alas! woe to me, and thee, and
all of us, that it is too late!&mdash;Oh, Altaverde?
to what end shall we come?</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. To that which is decreed us by
fate; and after we are dead, whether worms,
fish, or crows fatten upon us, is more indifferent
to us than to hear how his holiness the pope
dined; for it will not be our business, at any
rate, to pay the grave digger. There is but
one road into life for kings and beggars; but
there are many doors out of it; and whether
we depart by the middle or side door is unimportant.
Die we must; and if it be the will of
Heaven, we may as well die peaceably in our
beds as any other man.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Peaceably?</p>

<!-- page 9 -->

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. And how many die peaceably?
Almost every man dies with pain and agony.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But not with shame and ignominy.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Since you have been in love, one
can scarcely say a word to you. Who brought
you among us?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My own thoughtlessness.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Then quarrel with that; and be
not enraged against yourself. What is past is
past; and all you can do for yourself is to take
care of the future. Do that, and you will have
nothing more to reproach yourself with; for if
you fall, it will not be your fault. Go; serve
your country with your life and fortune; devote
your body, your soul, all your thoughts and exertions
to its advancement, and still, if Fortune
pleases, you may rot in a jail, though innocent
of every crime. Are there not innumerable
examples? Both ancient and modern history
abound in them. How many benefactors of
their country have died in chains! Should
this then be your lot, you will at least have no
cause to complain of your country's ingratitude;
for you have taken from mankind, and mankind
will but take from you in return  and thus your
account is balanced.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As we are old friends, I excuse
you when you talk such folly.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. For the same reason I excuse
your ill-humour. My folly, as you call it, makes
me a philosopher: but your ill-humour is of no
use, and makes you intolerable.&mdash;What would

<!-- page 10 -->

you have been, had you still continued at Ostiala,
tending your father's goats?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What alas! I am not now&mdash;an
honest man.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. But you have performed actions
for which the most honourable of mankind
might envy you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. They are of no value, for they
were done by a public robber.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. That cannot subtract from the
value of noble actions. The devil himself may
act nobly, although he be a devil.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He who pursues a dishonourable
line of life can scarcely perform any thing truly
honourable.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. A curse on that sentiment! Have
you not frequently drawn forth tears of joy?
Has no man remembered you in his prayers?
Has no man ever given you his blessing?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Alas! they knew not they were
giving it to a robber.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Your noble actions, then have
gained you tears of joy and the prayers and
blessings of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yet they can avail me nothing.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Then learn to flog yourself, and
turn monk. Why thus disparage the noble actions
you have performed! Have you not often
been a more powerful protector of right and
justice than the magistrates, whose office rendered
it their duty?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And who gave me a right to do so?</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Humanity.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh that it had left me to tend my
goats!&mdash;I tell you I can neither approve nor
boast of my actions; and even should some of
them be thought to deserve applause, yet the
bad ones are far more numerous, and will doubtless
one day bring me to the scaffold.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Are you there already?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. O Altaverde! who knows the hour
of his end?</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. No man; and so much the better:
otherwise no one could sleep quietly in his
bed: and sleep is the best of all human enjoyments.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can we, then, sleep quietly.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. I am almost asleep now; so good
night! take care not to let the fire go out; and
when you want to sleep yourself, wake me.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Altaverde went to sleep; and
Rinaldo, sighing, took up his guitar, and sang:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Once, with the happy, good and gay,<br/>

Sweet Innocence led on my youth; <br/>

While, taught through flow'ry vales to stray,<br/>

I sported with fair Peace and Truth:<br/>

But now, with conscious crimes oppress'd,<br/>

Wild gloomy cares, and anxious fears,<br/>

I waste my life in fruitless tears,<br/>

And, sighing, beat my anguish'd breast.</p>

<p>While free from guilt, from anguish free,<br/>

I view'd the cloudless azure skies,<br/>

My soul was an unruffled sea,<br/>

A mirror of Heaven's peaceful joys:<br/>

But now, as raging storms affright,<br/>

And rob all nature of her rest,<br/>

With horrid crimes my soul oppressed,<br/>

Is darker than the darksome night.</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>My guardian angel, forc'd away,<br/>

With grief my lot to fate consigns;<br/>

Despair has mark'd me for her prey;<br/>

My soul to torture Peace resigns.<br/>

Faded is Hope's once flow'ry wreath,<br/>

Now chang'd to Vice's galling chains,<br/>

Chang'd all my Joys to hell-born pains;<br/>

Unblest in life, and infamous in death.</p>

</div>

<p>But now one of the dogs, that lay before the
fire, barking, Altaverde started up and seized
his musket. Rinaldo had scarcely cried out
"Who's there?" before the sign was given that
one of their party had arrived. The dogs returned
to their rest, and Nicolo joined them.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Well! what is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. I am come to inform you that we
have heard the bells of some mules at a distance.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. In such a night as this?</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. They must have lost their way.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. You are all still near the hermitage?</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. All except Pietro and Giambattista,
who are out upon the scout. The remaining
thirty are all together.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Is not Girolamo still with you?</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. Yes; and rejoicing already in the
capture of the mules.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. I do not doubt it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Altaverde, had you not better join
him. You know Girolamo is not overstocked
with prudence.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. As you please.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Send Cinthio to me: I will wait
here for him.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. 'Tis well.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And if you can avoid bloodshed&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Most surely, if it be possible.</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. Captain, will you remain here alone?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Till Cinthio comes, I will.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Take a little sleep, Captain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. God grant I may! leave the dogs
with me.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Good night!</p>

<p><i>Nicolo</i>. A happy meeting!</p>

<p>Thus departed Nicolo and Altaverde. Meanwhile
Rinaldo threw some wood on the fire
then lay down beneath a tree, and drew his
cloak over his head; while the storm raged
above him, and the dry wood loudly cracked in
the flames.</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Rinaldo, with a sigh, "once,
I could exclaim, with confidence, whenever I
closed my eyes to sleep, Protect me, ye guardian
angels! but now I can neither pray nor
close my eyes in sleep. Oh, that I could relieve
this anguish with tears!"</p>

<p>The dogs barked. Rinaldo threw off his
cloak, and starting up, seized his pistols. The
dogs sprang furiously upon a man; but Rinaldo
called them back, approached the stranger, and
beheld a venerable old man, with silvered hair
and beard, and dressed in a brown great coat.
His right hand held a staff; in his left was a
lantern, with the light extinguished; and a little
dog anxiously leaped about him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Rinaldo, soon as he had
quieted his dogs.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am known by the name of the
Old Man of Oriolo-hill, and am come from the
adjacent territories, where, according to my
custom I have been procuring provisions, with
which I am returning to my hermitage. But
the wind has extinguished my light; and if I am
not mistaken, though I know the country pretty
well, I have got out of my road. Permit me to
light my lamp, and I shall presently find my
way. Good night!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Old man, why do you look so steadfastly
at me?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am glad to have found you by
this fire, and to have an opportunity to light my
lamp.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And who do you take me to be?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. To know or not to know who you
are is to me indifferent. The knowledge
of men is no longer interesting to me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am unfortunate.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am sorry for you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My fate has compelled me to wander
among the vallies of the Appenines; and
Rinaldini the famous robber renders these
regions very dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. 'Tis true.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I fear that cruel man.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Cruel! 'Tis said be deserves not
that reproach. I have myself twice applied to
him for favours.&mdash;I was desirous of having a
letter of protection for my little cottage.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do not deceive yourself regarding
him.</p>

<!-- page 15 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. 'Tis of little consequence. The
few years I have to live he may rob me of when
God Almighty pleases. The debt of nature
must one day be paid. If he set fire to my cottage
I can build another; gold he will not find,
and if he kill my two goats, the farmers of the
neighbourhood, who love me much, will give me
a couple more. Be it as God Almighty pleases!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you in want?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. He who has fortitude feels no
want.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Permit me to do a good action.
Take this purse.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I do not choose to contract debts
I shall not be able to pay. Neither have I need
of money. Adieu! good night!</p>

<p>Thus he departed, nor did Rinaldo venture
to detain him longer. He lay down again beneath
the tree, and the next time the dogs barked,
the morning dawned and Cinthio arrived.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Captain what ails you? Why do
you no longer continue with your people? You
are grown fond of solitude, and fall out with
us all.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have fallen out with myself, Cinthio.
I know not what is the matter with me.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Altaverde says you are in love.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And so I am.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Well! that is no misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Four days ago I was taking a ramble
through a small valley, where I saw a maid.&mdash;Ah!
Cinthio, she was an angel. She was
gathering berries; I addressed her, and she talked

<!-- page 16 -->

with me as innocence talks with vice. Our
people then came up, and I was obliged to leave
her. Since that time I have never seen her, nor
do I know she is, or where she lives.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then forget her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is impossible.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Man can do whatever he resolves
to do.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is not true. Otherwise I
could become an honest man.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Discourage not our people with
these thoughts. Cast up your own account of
evil when you please; but keep it to yourself.</p>

<p>Rinaldo said no more, but silently lay down
beneath the tree, and at length went to sleep.
When he awoke the sun was risen, the storm
was past, the clouds dispersed, and Cinthio had
been joined by two more of their party.&mdash;They
sat with him round the fire and were preparing
chocolate.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Good morning, Captain.</p>

<p><i>The others</i>. Good morning.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thank you. Give me a dish of
chocolate.</p>

<p><i>Paolo</i>. 'Tis extremely good.</p>

<p><i>Girolamo</i>. True Spanish chocolate. Altaverde
sends you word, that we have taken the
mules. There are three of them. They were
loaded with the baggage of a Neapolitan Prince,
and were going to Florence, if we had not changed
their destination. The booty however was
not great.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Were any men killed?</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p><i>Girolamo</i>. The three muleteers. The rascals
might have discovered us, and there are
more muleteers in the world. Altaverde is dividing
the plunder. He found this little case in
one of the packages and sends it to you.</p>

<p>Rinaldo opened it, and beheld the portrait of
a beautiful girl in the habit of a nun, and on the
reverse that of a young man in uniform. The
setting was not rich but very tasty.</p>

<p>Soon after came Altaverde with a numerous
troop of Rinaldo's party, who pitched their tents,
made a fire, and cooked their dinner; after
which they sang, danced, drank and played.</p>

<p>Rinaldo concerted with Altaverde new measures
of safety; and when the troop divided to
take their respective posts, Rinaldo crossed
the mountains into another small valley, where
he laid himself down under a tree by the side of
a fountain.</p>

<p>Here Altaverde brought him a paper relative
to the division of spoil, which he signed,
and towards noon returned to his joyous companions,
where a grand feast waited his arrival.</p>

<p>"Captain!" said Girolamo&mdash;"Your people
observe that you are unhappy, and are anxious
to know what has befallen you. Perhaps you
wish for something we can procure you; if so,
it shall be obtained, even should we purchase it
with our lives. But if it is mere caprice or low
spirits that disturb you, we beg you to drive
them away, and not to make us out of humour
with you also."</p>

<p>Rinaldo having for a few moments silently

<!-- page 18 -->

cast his eyes around the company that encircled
him, at length addressed them in these words:</p>

<p>"Have you read the declaration of the Republics
of Venice, Genoa, and Lucca? It has
been publicly proclaimed. A price is set upon
my head." </p>

<p>"Heed it not Captain!" they all exclaimed
with one accord. "No man will earn it."</p>

<p>"Who will dare to touch the hair of your
head," said Girolamo, "while we are with you?"</p>

<p>And, as he said this, he waved his sabre.
The rest followed his example; crying,</p>

<p>"Our life and blood, Captain, are yours as
long as we have breath."</p>

<p>Altaverde now showed the partition paper,
and each took his share with perfect content.
After dinner they again played, sang, danced and
made merry.</p>

<p>As Rinaldo was lying under a tree, Florilla,
an Amazonian of his troop, came up to him, seated
herself by him, and began to clean her pistols.</p>

<p><i>Florilla</i>. The price, Captain, that has been
set upon your head, is not the only cause of your
dejection. A man like you trembles not for
distant dangers. I doubt not the cause is much
nearer home.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you mean.</p>

<p><i>Florilla</i>. I cannot be mistaken. The seat of
your complaint, I believe, is your heart.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Doubtless many things oppress me
there.</p>

<p><i>Florilla</i>. Half a year ago 'twas so with me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Half a year ago?</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p><i>Florilla</i>. But now 'tis past. At that time I
was foolishly in love with you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With me?</p>

<p><i>Florilla</i>. I thought you must have perceived
it.</p>

<p>As she said this, she threw down the pistols
and arose.</p>

<p>"I absolutely thought," added she, "that I
<i>must</i> be the Captain's sweetheart;" and thus
saying, she left him.</p>

<p>Rinaldo's eyes pursued her steps. He then
arose from his uneasy resting place and immediately
gave the signal appointed for calling his
people together.</p>

<p>"It is my intention," said he to them, "to remove
to the mountains of Albonigo. You will
therefore strike your tents, call in the out posts,
and at night halt in the valley of St. James's
Chapel. To-morrow, at noon, you will be in the
plains of the Four Hills of La Cera. If my plan
succeeds, we shall strike a bold stroke."</p>

<p>Upon this they all huzzaed for joy, and packed
up their baggage. The posts were called
in, and Girolamo set forward with the van.
Then followed Altaverde with the main body,
and Cinthio brought up the rear. What route
Rinaldo meant to take no man knew.</p>

<p>He took his guitar and his arms, and accompanied
by two dogs went to the spot whither the
old man was gone the preceding night.</p>

<p>He soon found a footpath, and when the lengthened
shadows marked the approach of evening
he perceived through the trees a small cottage

<!-- page 20 -->

near the ridge of a mountain; to this he directed
his steps, and, before he reached it, saw
the old man above spoken of grubbing up roots.</p>

<p>They saluted each other, and seemed mutually
embarrassed. At length the old man, endeavouring
to collect himself, inquired,</p>

<p>"Have you not yet found the great road?"</p>

<p>"I have not been seeking it," replied Rinaldo.
"I only sought for your abode, to ask you
for a night's lodging. If you deny my request,
and refuse me your protection, I shall remain as
you found me last night, in the open air."</p>

<p><i>Old man</i>. You may pass the night here, but
you will be very ill accommodated.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. They who can rest at all, are always
accommodated.</p>

<p><i>Old man</i>. A bed of hay.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am not very nice; and, as you saw,
I was harder lodged last night. My unhappy
fate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old man</i>. What brings you into these solitudes?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The consequences of an unfortunate
moment.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Perhaps you have killed your antagonist
in an affair of honour as it is called?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Excuse my answering that question.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. If you can take up with what you
will find, you may follow me.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now accompanied him in silence, till
they arrived at the hermitage, where he was
shown into a small but neat and clean apartment.

<!-- page 21 -->

A couple of tables and a few chairs were
all its furniture; on one of the tables lay a latin
bible, on which stood a crucifix, and on the other
a piece of netting, which Rinaldo immediately
observed; but it presently occurred to him,
that it was possible the old man might himself
sometimes net. Meanwhile the old man removed
the work, as he observed that his guest
seemed to consider it with uncommon attention.
Rinaldo, however, did not venture to ask, whether
it was his own work, and the old man for a
while left the room.</p>

<p>He returned with a lighted lamp; and Rinaldo
then drew two bottles of wine from his pockets
and set them on the table, saying,</p>

<p>"When we have drank a glass of wine together
we shall be better acquainted."</p>

<p>"An acquaintance (replied the old man) that
is formed between two honest men by a bottle
of wine, often becomes as hearty as the wine itself,
which is the most heart inspiring liquor
heaven ever gave to mortals. It will be the best
part of our supper; for I can only offer you bread
and cheese, some butter, and a few melons, which
I gathered this morning."</p>

<p>" 'Tis enough, my good friend, for us two; or
even had we a third to join us," said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Upon which the old man quickly answered:</p>

<p>"A third! is any one else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one with me. But here, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a soul lives here but myself, my little
dog, and a pair of turtle doves."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was silent. But the old man asked:

<!-- page 22 -->

<p>"How came you to think of finding any one
here beside me?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo smiled, opened the table-drawer and
showed him the netting.</p>

<p>"Ah! (answered the old man) Yes, that netting
does indeed belong to a third person; but
one that does not live here. She forgot it this
morning and left it here."</p>

<p>Upon this the old man left his guest, and went
to bring in their frugal repast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo examined the apartment
more particularly, and opened a door that led
into a small room. Here he saw the man's bed
over which hung a pair of pistols, between two
paintings in oil. He took the lamp, to examine
the paintings, and immediately hastened back.</p>

<p>The pictures were of the very same persons
of which miniatures had been brought him that
morning as booty; (the nun and the officer) to
which they were so exactly alike, that it was
impossible he could be mistaken. Thus he left
the chamber and returned pensive to his place.</p>

<p>The old man, whom we shall call Donato, now
brought supper, and as soon as he had pronounced
a short prayer, seated himself with his guest
at table.</p>

<p>When they had both eaten heartily, emptied
the first bottle, and opened the second, a conversation,
by no means uninteresting, arose.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Let us drink the health of the aforesaid
third person, be she here or not.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. With all my heart! but here she
certainly is not.</p>

<!-- page 23 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I do not mean to doubt your word.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And yet I perceive you do not believe
it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And of what importance is it?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. To me, of much. I would not pass
for a man that would assert a falsehood.&mdash;At a
farm about a league off, beyond the mountain,
there lives a maid, who sometimes calls here,
and who left her netting this morning.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she the farmer's daughter?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. His foster child, not his own. She
is a good natured, innocent girl, and I love her as
a father loves his offspring; for she is worthy
of my esteem, and of that of the whole world.
Her health, with all my heart!</p>

<p>They ceased and drank. Then followed a
pause. At length the old man, whom the wine
made garrulous renewed the conversation.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. May I ask you of what country you
are?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am a Roman.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. A Roman, born in Rome itself?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Countryman your hand! I am also
a Roman born. Yet I am by no means proud
of my birth. 'Tis an ungrateful country.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Have you experienced it?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I have been very ill used. Even
the imperial tribunal of the Ruota and their sentences
could not&mdash;but enough!&mdash;I live here in
peace, and forgive my enemies. Rome no longer
produces men. She knows not how to support
her dignity, and her inhabitants are licentious,

<!-- page 24 -->

cruel, and unjust.&mdash;How have they treated
you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My misfortunes were the consequence
of my errors.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. That would be my consolation, could
I thus accuse myself. But I have suffered innocently.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was about to reply, when they clearly
distinguished the voices of men before the
hermitage, who constantly approached, and at
length knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"What is that?" exclaimed Rinaldo with astonishment.</p>

<p>Donato quietly opened the window and inquired
who was there?</p>

<p>"Open the door," cried a voice from without.</p>

<p>"There are armed men at the door, (said
Donato.) They may be police officers or soldiers.
If you have reason to fear such visiters,
go into that room, and so out of the window into
the garden; then get over the hedge, and go
straight forward, till you come to some rocks,
among which on the left you may conceal yourself
in a grotto.&mdash;I will open the door presently,
that nobody may suspect any thing."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now called his dogs, and went into
the other chamber, while Donato opened the
door to the strangers.</p>

<p>Six armed men entered, and followed him into
the parlor; meanwhile Rinaldo overheard
what passed.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the hermit, Donato."</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>"Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"I live entirely alone."</p>

<p>"Do you know us?"</p>

<p>"How is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Do you fear us?"</p>

<p>"Even were you police officers, an innocent
man could not fear you."</p>

<p>"You mistake us; we are no spies for justice
to lean on when she is lame. Where is your
money?"</p>

<p>"In this purse. Here it is."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil with your paltry pence.
Give us more."</p>

<p>" 'Tis all the money I possess."</p>

<p>"We do not believe you."</p>

<p>" 'Tis the truth."</p>

<p>"You are no beggar; there stands your wine,
you rogue. Bring us more wine."</p>

<p>" 'Tis a present, and I have no more."</p>

<p>"Blood and thunder! Here two people have
been eating. You are not alone. Knock the
rascal down, he has told us a lie."</p>

<p>"I had a visiter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bind the old sinner! and make him confess."</p>

<p>"Be merciful and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More money!"</p>

<p>"Take whatever you can find. Money I have
none."</p>

<p>"You obstinate villain! won't you confess
then?"</p>

<p>Upon this the robbers fell upon Donato, who
cried aloud for help, though without knowing
whence it could come, when Rinaldo suddenly

<!-- page 26 -->

opened the door, and taking out a pistol, demanded
in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"What is your business here?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! our captain!"&mdash;Exclaimed one of
the gang; while they took off their hats, and
released the trembling hermit, who tottered to a
chair, repeating in a broken voice:</p>

<p>"The captain?"</p>

<p>"Are these your deeds of heroism?" continued
Rinaldo&mdash;"Dare you to disgrace my name
with such actions? Are you indeed of Rinaldini's
band? Have you such necessities as to force the
last penny from the hand of poverty? Is this
your bravery, to bind an unarmed man? Which
is the villain that first laid hands on this feeble
old man?"</p>

<p>A profound silence now ensued, after which
Rinaldo continued with increasing vehemence:</p>

<p>"Which was the villain? name him, or I will
shoot the first man that stands before me."</p>

<p>" 'Twas Paolo," murmured the man that
stood next to Rinaldo: upon which, without
another word, Rinaldo instantly fired at him and
broke his arm. Paolo fell; but his companions
continued motionless.</p>

<p>"And why (said Rinaldo, with a look of rage)
have you departed from your route?"</p>

<p>"We were in search of you, captain," replied
one of them.</p>

<p>"Is it your business to dog me where'er I go?
(continued Rinaldo.) Go join the main body.
You know our laws; you know what you have
done, and the punishment you deserve. Take

<!-- page 27 -->

with you this base fellow, who belongs not to
Rinaldini's company, and wait my coming, and
your sentence to-morrow."</p>

<p>Upon this, the robbers departed, carrying
Paolo with them; while Donato remained silent
and trembling in his chair.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now approached him, took his hand,
and pressing it, said:</p>

<p>"Be not alarmed, good old man!"

<p>"Open that closet," cried Donato, in a broken
voice&mdash;"and give me the little bottle of
drops."</p>

<p>Which Rinaldo having done, he poured out
a spoonful at Donato's request, and gave it him.
Donato swallowed it, and seemed to come to
himself.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. So you are Rinaldini himself?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I am indebted to you for my life, and
yet cannot rejoice in your acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who have you to fear?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Your name alone is frightful, and
yourself terrible.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Alas! that it should be so!</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Your actions here before my eyes fill
my heart with fear and terror.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And mine with grief. Oh! that I
could have spared myself and you this scene! but
you know not these horrible beings. Fear and
terror alone can restrain them.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And are you not yourself afraid of
such monsters?</p>

<!-- page 28 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Even if I feared them, I must not let
them have the least suspicion of it.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Unhappy man! Into what a connexion
have you fallen!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Friend! the goodness of your heart
unites me to you; for you are worthy of my confidence.
You shall know my whole story. But
not now; for it would affect you too much, and
you need repose. Let me lead you to bed. I
will await the morning in a chair.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now conducted Donato to bed, and
wrapping himself up in his cloak, threw himself
into a chair. It was not, however, till long after
midnight, that he fell asleep, and he awoke with
the first rays of the sun.</p>

<p>"I am very ill," said Donato with a sigh, when
Rinaldo approached his bed to inquire after his
health.</p>

<p>"I wished to be of service to you," said Rinaldo,
"and came to give you protection; but am
the innocent cause of your present illness, which
I assure you gives me the greatest pain. Do not,
however, take my good intention ill."</p>

<p>"By no means," replied Donato, in a faint
voice; "on the contrary, I am thankful to Providence
for sending you hither; otherwise I
should most probably have been murdered."</p>

<p>He then requested him to fetch some bottles of
physic out of the closet, and having directed him
now to mix it, swallowed a spoonful, after which
a soft sleep soon closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now went out to taste the morning
air, and with expanding heart admired the

<!-- page 29 -->

beauties of the rising sun.&mdash;With majestic glory
the king of day advanced amid a blaze of
light, rising above the misty summits of the
mountains, and darted his genial rays into the
narrow vale where Donato dwelt. The birds
celebrated the magnificent return of day with a
hymn of joy; and Rinaldo in pensive mood covered
his face and sighed.</p>

<p>"Even on me the golden sun. (said he) bestows
his light; on me, as on all men, whether
good or bad; on me, to whom his beneficient
rays are as the lightning's flash, threatening destruction
on my guilty conscience."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now heard a rustling near him in the
hedge, when raising his eyes the beauteous
maid he had seen and talked with a few days before,
but whom he had not since met, approached
him.</p>

<p>Struck and embarrassed with this incident,
both stood silent during a few moments, till at
length Rinaldo addressed her in the following
words:</p>

<p>"Are you not the virtuous maid of the neighbouring
farm house, who sometimes visits the
hermit Donato?"</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what is your name?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Aurelia; and you are the man who
spoke with me a few days ago, as I was gathering
berries?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The same. The friend of your friend
Donato.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. And where is he?</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He is asleep.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Asleep so late. He must surely
be ill.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed he is not well.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Good God! what ails him?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A trifling indisposition. He will soon
be better. He will be better when he has slept.
We must not disturb him.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I will go and tell my father. Poor
Donato is old and weak, and must want assistance.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. We will give him whatever assistance
he needs.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. We?&mdash;I do not know you well
enough to stay here in your company.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Be not afraid, fair maiden!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. You are a stranger and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am the friend of Donato.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I must hear that from his own
mouth.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You shall.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Well! I will wait for his confirmation.
But till then I must not stay here alone
with you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Of what are you afraid?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Afraid? I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I pledge my word of honour, and
my most solemn oath, that you have nothing to
fear!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Who are you then?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A traveller.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. And yet stay so long in this place?</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am much pleased with the situation.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Among the mountains?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Among the mountains where
dwells so lovely a maid.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. If you mean me, I live beyond the
mountains.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes; Donato told me so.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Have you then spoken with him of
me? How came you to fall on such a subject?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Through your netting.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Aha!</p>

<p>A rustling was now heard in the hedge, and
Rinaldo looking towards it, Cinthio gave him
the wink. Aurelia hastened into the hermitage.</p>

<p>"Captain!" said Cinthio, "your presence
among us is necessary. There is an alarm."</p>

<p>"Wait for me," replied Rinaldo; and instantly
entered the hermitage.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," said he to Aurelia, "stay
with Donato."</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. That I certainly shall, since he is ill.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And when he awakes, tell him I
shall soon return.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Whither then are you going?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My servant calls my attention to
my baggage where a trifling accident demands
my presence. Farewell, dear girl, and forget
me not. Be kind to my memory.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. How do you know that I am not
so already?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. O yes.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Who told you so?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My heart.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Believe it not. Farewell.</p>

<p>Rinaldo pressed her hand, and hurrying
out, accompanied Cinthio to the spot where his
people had passed the night.</p>

<p>" 'Tis well you are come, Captain," cried several
voices, confusedly. "We would know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent," thundered Rinaldo. "Girolamo,
read the fifth and sixth articles of our laws
aloud!"</p>

<p>This being done, Rinaldo related the scene
he had witnessed at the hermitage, and concluded
with a proclamation to this effect:
"Now let our compact and our laws decide."</p>

<p>"Pardon! pardon! pardon! pardon for Paolo!"
cried several voices.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was silent.</p>

<p>Paolo who lay on the ground and recently
had his wound bound, cried out for pardon in a
faint voice.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was still silent.</p>

<p>Girolamo now went up to him, and begged
that Paolo might be pardoned.</p>

<p>Rinaldo made no reply.</p>

<p>Florilla now went up to him and said; "Captain!
in the name of all the pangs I have suffered
for you, I beg for Paolo's pardon; for on
him I have fixed my affections, in the hope of
suppressing and exterminating my passion for
you."</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>"Like you, (said Rinaldo) I am subject to
the law, and have no power to pardon him."</p>

<p>"Be no longer subject to the law, (cried they
all) you shall be our legislator, and shall have
power to pardon."</p>

<p>"If that be your will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We swear it."</p>

<p>"Then be Paolo pardoned, and his companions
also.&mdash;But with one condition."</p>

<p>"Pronounce it."</p>

<p>"That this be the first and last occasion on
which such conduct can be forgiven."</p>

<p>"Be it so."</p>

<p>"And further&mdash;I adjudge that Paolo and his
companions, who maltreated that venerable old
man, shall give him two goats, two barrels of
wine, and a dozen fowls."</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!&mdash;Long live our noble Captain!"</p>

<p>Thus, amid rejoicings, music and acclamations,
Rinaldo now took his breakfast before his tent,
and having attended awhile to the amusements
of his people, signed various papers at his desk,
and having written and sealed some instructions,
he directed the whole corps to be assembled.
They soon formed a large circle around
him, and waited in silent expectation, till Rinaldo,
who continued sitting, thus began:</p>

<p>"Here Girolamo, I give you an order, which
you will open at Borgo, where the state of affairs
will determine whether or not you are to
proceed to Arezzo. The business that calls
you thither requires prudence, which, however,

<!-- page 34 -->

to you I have no occasion particularly to
recommend. You, Florilla, I send to Biblena,
where you will endeavour to learn how we are
spoken of. Nicolo and Sebastiano will cross the
woods to Bosina. To you, Amadeo, I give charge
of the woods of Anghiarto, Altaverde will take
six or eight men with him, and endeavour to secure
the person of the Mayor of Brancolino, these
orders contain the particulars of that expedition.
Towards evening Mattheo will remove with
twenty men to the South Mountains, and take
possession of the pass of Caprile. Alsetto will
remain here with thirty men till further orders.
Cinthio will choose out twelve men, and draw
off the left into the poplar valley of Oriolo,
near the pass among the rocks. Here is the
watchword. The detached corps will keep as
close together as possible during three days, in
the western plains, before the forest of Marcia.
And now let these plans be executed without
delay."</p>

<p>All were now in motion, and Rinaldo having
loaded his two great dogs with provisions and
medicines, returned to the hermitage.</p>

<p>Aurelia was no longer there; but a young
peasant boy, a son of her friend the neighbouring
farmer, stood by Donato's bed, who was
awake and said he was better.</p>

<p>Donato now sent away his young attendant,
desiring him to fetch some wood, and Rinaldo
gave the old man a few spoonfuls of the corroborative
physic, which he had with him, but
did not venture to enter on a subject to which

<!-- page 35 -->

however, at length Donato himself led the discourse.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I hope soon to be quite re-established.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis what I most sincerely wish.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. You are come perhaps to take leave
of me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you imagine so?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I hope it. Now I know who you
are, I would not that any one should know I
am acquainted with you. You know the world,
and that all men depend on the opinion entertained
of them by others. I thank you for the
preservation of my life; but no man shall be
informed by me that I have given lodging to
the dreaded Rinaldini, on whose head so high
a price has been set. Aurelia has made me
her confidant.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Has she so?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. You ought not to have said to her
what you have.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But I confess to you that I am in
love with her!</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Is it possible? Can you expect she
will return your love when she learns who you
are?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And why need she know it?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Would you then deceive her?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How? Suppose I renounce my
way of life, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. 'Tis too late.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will tell her.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. You must not see her more.</p>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. She is about to take the veil.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who has&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I have brought it about.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed! Then be assured I will
bring about the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. What will you do?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That you shall learn.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Do nothing that is dishonourable
or base.&mdash;If you really love Aurelia, how can
you wish to make her unhappy? But you do
not love her with the purity with which she deserves
to be loved. You cannot love her in an
honourable way, and your passion is a crime.
Aurelia must be rescued from your sight. Or
would you take her with you amid your lawless
band, and deliver her up to that justice which
will surely sooner or later overtake you, as an
accomplice? Is it not enough that you are
what you are? Then leave the girl to live
and die with honour. If you leave me soon
you will confer on me an obligation, for I expect
several visiters.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Not through fear; for that is a stranger
to my breast: through complaisance I will,
but let me first ask you, whom do the portraits
represent that hang over your bed?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. They are my friends, and persons of
quality.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The one in the dress of a nun and
the other in uniform?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. From this very man, whose portrait
you see, I expect a visit. He is going to

<!-- page 37 -->

Florence, and his mules with their baggage
have been taken from him on the mountains,
probably by your people. The drivers were
shot, except one, who being very young, ran
away: he took refuge with Aurelia's foster-father,
where my friend, whose portrait you see,
now is.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If he is your friend give him this;
for perhaps he would not willingly lose it.</p>

<p>So saying, he gave Donato the case containing
the portraits he had received out of the booty
found with the mules. Donato took it, opened
the case, and no sooner beheld the portraits than
he kissed them both.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. You have made me a present of
great value, which the right owner shall have
again.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And will you not tell me his name?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. For why?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps I may be of service to him
for your sake?</p>

<p>Donato was about to reply, when the peasant
boy suddenly came in crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are coming! they are coming!"</p>

<p>And immediately after entered the very
person who was the subject of their conversation.
He was dressed in uniform, and bore a
cross of the order of Malta. With him came
two peasants belonging to the farmer, and the
brother of the latter.</p>

<p>The stranger cast a piercing look at Rinaldo,
who returned it in such a manner that the former
turned his eyes away; then giving Donato

<!-- page 38 -->

his hand, and saying, "A speedy recovery;" he
departed from hermitage.</p>

<p>The Chevalier of Malta, however, hurried
after him, and came to the door of the hermitage
as Rinaldo happened to look back, and
perceiving him stopped. Upon which the Chevalier
went up to him, and said:</p>

<p>"I believe, Sir, I have had the pleasure of
seeing you somewhere before."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is very possible.</p>

<p><i>Chevalier</i>. Are you not the person who called
himself Donato's friend, and spoke this
morning with a young woman named Aurelia.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Chevalier</i>. You are a traveller?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Chevalier</i>. May I ask your name?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You shall hear it when you have
told me yours.</p>

<p><i>Chevalier</i>. My name is neither a secret nor
matter of suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who imagines it to be so?</p>

<p><i>Chevalier</i>. I am the prince of Rocella.</p>

<p>Two of Rinaldo's people now brought the
goats, the fowls and the wine, which Paolo was
sentenced to give, as a peace-offering, to the
hermit, and which Rinaldo delivered to the
young peasant, saying:</p>

<p>"These are for my friend Donato: he
knows of them already. You may tell him by
and by that they are all arrived."</p>

<p>He then turned again to the Prince, who was
waiting for his answer and to know his name:</p>

<!-- page 39 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you come from the farm-house
where Aurelia lives, tell me whether she is
still there?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. I know not how&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How I came to ask that question
when you were expecting to hear my name?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. In truth that was my meaning.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If possible, excuse my telling my
name; a false one I ought not to give you, and
my true name&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. 'Tis impossible I can mistake. I
saw you about half a year ago at Florence, under
the name of the Marquis of Pepoli: did I
not? We talked of the German houses, and
you grew warm when a story was told of that
notorious robber Rinaldini, which tended much
to his prejudice.</p>

<p>One of Rinaldo's people now gave him the
wink very significantly. He understood the
signal, and approaching the prince with great
confidence, said, "Know that I am Rinaldini
himself," and instantly hastened away.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now inquired of his comrade what
was the matter? and received for answer,
"Cinthio hesitates to approach the Poplar
Vale near Oriolo, as a caravan of travellers
have taken up their quarters there."</p>

<p>Upon this Rinaldo hastened to Cinthio, and
found him and his party among the bushes of a
pleasant hill; where he learnt from himself
what had been reported to him, and, after some
reflection, gave the following orders:</p>

<p>Wheel off with your people to the right,

<!-- page 40 -->

pursue the high road, and keep the road from
Oriolo to the convent of San Benedetto constantly
in sight. If you meet with a beautiful
young woman in a carriage, stop it and carry off
the girl without further ceremony; and at dusk
we will meet again upon this very spot."</p>

<p>Upon this he disguised his face with brown
paint, dressed himself as a hunter, and took with
him one of his companions, called Severro, also
dressed as a hunter, and armed like him with a
double-barrelled gun, some pocket pistols and a
hanger. Thus equipped, and accompanied by
his dogs, they proceeded to the Poplar Vale.</p>

<p>When they came to the hill that commanded
the valley, they perceived a tent pitched, and
near it some mules grazing, and several men
dispersed here and there, who seemed to be
cooking their supper by a large fire they had
lighted.</p>

<p>Having observed them for some time, they
perceived two ladies in the tent, and at a small
distance from it unloaded baggage, and the
muleteers lying near their charge.</p>

<p>About forty paces from this spot ran a murmuring
brook, hurrying down the hill into this
beautiful valley; and hither came a fine active
youth belonging to the company, with an empty
vessel, to draw water. When the youth
saw Rinaldo, he screamed and would have fled,
had not Rinaldo called to him saying:</p>

<p>"Stop, young man!&mdash;Do you belong to yonder
company?"</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"Yes I do belong to them," said the boy, terrified
and hesitating.</p>

<p>"And who are those ladies in the tent?"</p>

<p>"The Marchioness of Altanare and her sister.
We are coming from San Leo, and are going to
Florence."</p>

<p>Rinaldo gave his companion the wink, and
they both went up to the tent, when the attendants
of the marchioness saluted and stared
at them, and her equery came out to them,
while the ladies listened, at the entrance, to
the following conversation:</p>

<p>"Whence are you, my good friends?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo replied: "I am the forester of Sorsina,
and am pursuing a bye road with my servant.
On seeing your company I felt a strong desire to
know who you are, and so I came to give you a
hint to be on your guard; for Rinaldini's troop
are now among these mountains."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" cried one of the ladies, "I am
dreadfully alarmed!"</p>

<p>"And why so?" said the equery, "we are
numerous enough to oppose force to force."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Rinaldo, smiling; "that
will avail but little; for Rinaldini's men are
very devils."</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. Heavens! why are those banditti suffered
to commit their depredations so quietly and
so undisturbed?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Because men are afraid of them.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. How strong may they be?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who can tell their strength? Rinaldo
is an outlaw, and a price by no means

<!-- page 42 -->

contemptible is set upon his head. Between
ourselves, I have been above a week in search of
him, in hopes of gaining the reward. If he
comes within reach of my gun he shall certainly
never escape.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. Do you know his person then?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He has been fully and accurately
described.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. In fact 'tis said he has no courage at
all himself, and that his people are obliged to do
all for him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So; then they must all be fools.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. And you think he is now here in the
neighbourhood?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am certain of it. We are eighteen
of us, and all hunters and good marksmen.
We are constantly watching for him, and have
agreed if we take him to divide the reward.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. And what are you to receive then when
you take the villain?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In Venice, Genoa, Lucca, and Florence,
money will be paid for his head, making
together a sum of three or four thousand sequins:
so that each of us will receive something.
The times are very bad. 'Tis certain, however,
we run the risk of our lives, and some of us may
bite the dust.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. The troops ought to be sent out against
the cut-purse.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And so they have, Madame, but
without success; he is too cunning for them
and has hiding holes where he keeps on the

<!-- page 43 -->

defensive. The militia of Lucca can tell a
pretty story of that kind. Three hundred of
them were driven over hill and dale by eighty
men under Rinaldini's command. They had
seventy men killed, and have never since dared
to stir a step against them.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. 'Tis really terrible to think what
depredations such a vagabond may commit.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis very true! Besides, he is a
very desperate fellow and very often has adventures,
even when quite alone, which would
make you split your sides with laughing.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. I should like to see one of these adventures.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Suppose you stood here quite off
your guard, and near you your equery, and all
your attendants collected round your tent; then
holding one pistol to your breast with his left
hand, and another with his right to your equery,
(while his companions take care of the rest of
the company,) he says I demand your rings,
your watches, and one hundred sequins.&mdash;I am
Rinaldini!</p>

<p>These words being accompanied with the
action they described, the marchioness screamed,
and the equery almost fell backwards with
surprise.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. Come, Mr. Forester, no jokes if
you please.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, no; no joke I assure you: I
am quite serious, Mr. Equery.</p>

<p><i>Equery</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. For God's sake!</p>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You wished to see a little of Rinaldini.
You see him now.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. Are you really&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am Rinaldini. Now no more preliminaries.
I have complied with your wish, and
you must comply with mine, that of possessing
your watches, your rings, and the trifling sum of
one hundred sequins. I will then give you a
protection on showing which none of my people
will touch a hair of you head till you arrive at
Florence.</p>

<p>Trembling from head to foot, the marchioness
took off her rings, and delivered her watch and
purse to Rinaldini, who said:</p>

<p>"Have you seen enough of Rinaldini?"&mdash;And
departed.</p>

<p>No one, however, was bold enough to pursue
him.</p>

<p>Night drew in, and his company assembled at
the appointed spot, without having met with the
expected carriage.&mdash;At this Rinaldo appeared
dejected, and, after taking one of his frugal suppers,
lay down to rest beneath a poplar; where,
having wrapped himself up in his cloak, he soon
fell asleep. His companions lighted a fire, set
two men to keep watch, and laid down to rest,
after Severro had related to them Rinaldo's joke
with the Marchioness.</p>

<p>Toward morning they all arose with one accord,
being awakened by repeated firings; and
having instantly seized their arms, they heard a
cry from the sentinels, flying, "We are surrounded."</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>"Surrounded!" exclaimed Rinaldo.</p>

<p>The sentinels now pointed to the neighbouring
peaks and vallies, and arms glittering
around them on all sides.</p>

<p><i>Severro</i>. Captain! what is to be done?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fight.</p>

<p><i>Severro</i>. That's of course. But we, a handful
of men, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. We must draw hither as many of
our party as we can. Alsetto, with his thirty
men, is still encamped on the old ground, and
here we are twelve men strong. Blow the
alarm-horn, and load your arms double.</p>

<p>The vallies now resounded with the horn,
and the echoes gave back the sound. Again a
horn was heard quite close to them, and presently
Altaverde joined them with five of their
friends.</p>

<p>"Comrades," cried they, "we are surrounded.
Both militia and regular troops are moving
towards us, and our friends Nero and Rispero
have fallen into the hands of the militia."</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning!" exclaimed Rinaldo.</p>

<p>And immediately horns were heard at a distance;
then nearer and nearer, till at length
they perceived Alsetto and his corps advancing
towards them across the valley.</p>

<p>They were now forty-nine men strong, who
all cried with one accord:</p>

<p>"Captain, let us attack!"</p>

<p>"Be it so (said Rinaldo) only I would first

<!-- page 46 -->

learn where the militia are placed. Then we
may easily cut our way through."</p>

<p>A few moments after he called to them to
wheel to the left, and drew them off into the
vale below.</p>

<p>They had marched a few hundred paces,
when they saw a paper lying on the ground,
which Altaverde took up and delivered to Rinaldo,
who opened it and read as follows:</p>

<p class="small">"In the name of the government a free pardon
is hereby offered to any one of Rinaldo's
men who shall voluntarily quit his service and
go over to the regular troops. And whosoever
shall bring the head of Rinaldini, shall receive,
besides his pardon, a reward of five hundred
sequins."</p>

<p>Rinaldo then folded up the paper, saying,</p>

<p>"Comrades, this paper promises you a free
pardon if you will go over to the troops and
put yourselves wholly and entirely in their
power."</p>

<p>"And is it signed by the Grand Duke?" said
Alsetto.</p>

<p>"By no man. 'Tis a scrap of paper without
date, place, or signature," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Then we should be the most credulous of
fools, (cried Altaverde) to risk our lives at the
mere demand of a subaltern officer. 'Tis written
by some coward, who is afraid to fight us,
and, had we yielded, nobody would have avowed
this engagement. We should only have
been made a jest of and hung, as indeed we
should justly deserve. Captain, tear it in pieces,

<!-- page 47 -->

and let us send it back to them as wadding
from our guns. We will singe the writer's
beard with his own treacherous promises."</p>

<p>"Comrades (said Rinaldo,) it is my opinion
that we should advance towards the frontiers
of the ecclesiastical state, and cut our way
through the militia into the forest of Marle."</p>

<p>"Let us go! Let us march!" they all cried.</p>

<p>Thus they crossed the valley, and drew off
towards the opposite hill. They had almost
gone round it, and were very near the frontiers,
when they fell in with a piquet of militia,
whom they unexpectedly attacked with so
much vigour, that they drove them back. But
presently after they met with a detachment of
above a hundred and fifty men, rapidly advancing
upon them.</p>

<p>"Comrades (cried Rinaldini) now defend
yourselves bravely! We are but three steps
from the frontiers, and the woods are scarcely
a hundred paces off. If we are taken alive, we
shall die upon the wheel or the gallows. Let
us, then, rather die like the brave, sword in
hand. If we are but courageous, we shall certainly
cut our way through.&mdash;Let us be bold and
quick."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, he gave the signal
by firing a pistol, and rushed upon the enemy;
and his companions followed his example. The
fury with which the attack was made, at first
threw their opponents into confusion, and at
length they began to yield; when one of their
officers reproached them with their cowardice,

<!-- page 48 -->

put himself at their head, and advanced into
the hottest of the battle.</p>

<p>A dreadful slaughter now took place. Alsetto
fell fighting by the side of Rinaldo, and
three of his companions with him. Altaverde,
Cinthio, Severro, and Rinaldo still fought like
lions. Musket-balls and sabres fell with the
rapidity of a hail-shower. Severro had his
head cut open, and fell; and twelve of the banditti
were killed near him by musket-balls and
sabres. Rinaldo, with his united forces, attacked
the flanks of the regulars, and at length
fortunately reached the frontiers, though separated
from his men. Here he was attacked by
two dragoons one of whom he shot, and the
other took to flight.</p>

<p>Tired and fainting, he reached the wood;
and concealing himself in a thick bush, sank
down on the earth with a panting heart, and
almost senseless.</p>

<p>He did not come to himself till mid-day, and
then felt himself much oppressed by a most
burning thirst. He therefore roused himself
and penetrated further into the forest, till he
came to a fountain, where he lay down and
refreshed himself. On examining his pockets
he found two biscuits, which he swallowed
with the greatest avidity; and then creeping
into a bush, began to reflect.</p>

<p>Hunger however, soon drew him from his
retreat. He got up, examined his arms, filled
his bottle with water, and set forward.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he heard footsteps;

<!-- page 49 -->

and having listened for some time, perceived
a peasant, with a basket, walking quietly
along. He therefore advanced to meet him,
accosted him, and inquired whether he had
any thing to eat.</p>

<p>The peasant having first stared at him with
surprise and curiosity, informed him he was
carrying some cheese and sausages to a neighbouring
town. Rinaldo offered to purchase
them, took as much of his provisions as his
pouch would hold, and paid for them without
treating about the price; after which the
peasant, seeing he was so well paid for his provisions,
added a loaf asked for by Rinaldo, but
which the former had brought to eat on the
road.</p>

<p>"What news have you?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"This morning," replied the peasant, "there
has been much blood shed upon the frontiers."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The troops of Tuscany have caught that
thief Rinaldini."</p>

<p>"So, they have caught him, have they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though both he and his men defended
themselves like devils. But they were all shot
or cut to pieces."</p>

<p>"All?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them."</p>

<p>"And Rinaldini himself too?"</p>

<p>"Rinaldini himself!"</p>

<p>"That is very good news."</p>

<p>"Aye, very good. But at any rate the thief
would have been hung soon. 'Tis a pity he

<!-- page 50 -->

was not taken alive, and that he died so honourable
a death. However, the rascal is sure to
go to the devil."</p>

<p>"Aye?"</p>

<p>"Aye; for he died without absolution, under
a load of sins."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Either of us would have died with more
peace and honour, should we not?"</p>

<p>"Most surely; for we are neither of us
thieves?"</p>

<p>"Well, God bless you! if you are not going
my way."</p>

<p>Thus saying the peasant left him; and as
soon as he was out of sight, Rinaldo entered
the wood, and satisfied his hunger.</p>

<p>After a short refreshing sleep he again
arose, and proceeded some leagues farther into
the forest, till at length he unexpectedly came
to an open place a few hundred paces in circumference,
where before him, on a hill that
rose in the middle of it, were the ruins of a
castle.</p>

<p>He now looked around, but could not perceive
a living soul. A death-like silence reigned
over the whole scene; nor was a single
bird heard among the trees, though he thought
he perceived footsteps in the grass.</p>

<p>He now advanced to the ruins, and entered
a spacious court, covered with high grass.
Here he sat down on some fragments of statues,
in front of a ruined colonnade, and abandoned

<!-- page 51 -->

himself to his reflections, till a sudden
noise alarmed him. It was a roebuck that
rushed by; and Rinaldo rising, approached a
flight of steps leading to the upper part of the
castle.</p>

<p>Having ascended these, he came to a large
hall, where his footsteps loudly re-echoed; but
though he listened after every step, all was
solitude, and no signs of a living inhabitant appeared.</p>

<p>This hall led to a spacious apartment, on the
farther side of which were two wooden doors,
fastened with iron bolts. Here he stood and
listened, but heard nothing, except the noise of
his own breathing; and though he knocked at
both of them, the same silence still continued.</p>

<p>At length having drawn back the bolts of one
of the doors which creaked upon its hinges, he
entered into an empty room, which he immediately
left. In like manner he opened the
other door, and here also found an empty
apartment. He therefore again bolted the
doors, and returned by the way he came.</p>

<p>He now perceived, in a corner of the hall,
a small opening which led to another empty
room. This led to a second; and that to a
third. Here he suddenly trod on wood, and
perceived he was on a trap door fastened by
bolts, which he opened, and looked down into
a dark and deep place, and a small stone staircase.
He then carefully closed the door, and
returned by the way he came to the court
yard.</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>Evening now beginning to draw in fast, he
looked around for a tree to pass the night in,
and chose a majestic oak, amid whose thick
foliage he endeavoured to repose.</p>

<p>Having, however, passed the night with
scarcely any sleep, Rinaldo left his uneasy
lodging when day began to dawn, and set forward
in search of water, which he soon found.
As soon as he had quenched his thirst, and
filled his bottle, he advanced still farther,
cutting marks on the trees that he might again
find his way back to the ruins.</p>

<p>Towards noon he approached the road that
traversed the forest, and reposed, at a small
distance from it, under a thick bush.</p>

<p>He had not lain long before he heard the voices
of men, and the tinkling of mule-bells, which
seemed constantly to approach; till at length
a company of gipsies appeared, consisting of
three men, two old women, and a couple of
young women, four children, a mule with baggage,
two dogs and some animals for show.</p>

<p>These people seemed to know the place;
for they bent their course into the forest, and
went towards the fountain which Rinaldo had
just left. The dogs scarcely perceived him
before they set up a dreadful cry, and flew
furiously at him. One of the men seized his
fusil, which lay on the panniers, and the other
two drew their stilettoes.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now let loose his dogs, which instantly
darted forward out of the bush towards
the strangers.</p>

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>"Holla! who are you?" cried one of the
gipsies.</p>

<p>"Call in your dogs," cried Rinaldo, "or I
will shoot them!"</p>

<p>They called in the dogs, and the women held
them fast while Rinaldo approached them, and
said, in a resolute tone,</p>

<p>"We can hardly have any cause to fear each
other."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" inquired the gipsies
again.</p>

<p>"A man," replied Rinaldo, "who knows not
what it is to fear."</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. I know not what to make of
you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Think of me as you please&mdash;but
give me a glass of liquor if you have any.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. You shall have some when you
have paid for it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That I will do.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. You look, to me, like one that&mdash;that
had done something for which he was
afraid of being taken up.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is impossible. Come pour
out.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Yes, yes, you are certainly one
of Rinaldini's people.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Of what consequence is Rinaldini
to either of us?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. To me of great consequence.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To you?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Yes, very great.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How great?</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. At least to the amount of two
thousand sequins.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How so?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. If I could but deliver up his
head&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed! But you are too late.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Too late? I fancy he will think
it always time enough to be hung.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He will not think so now.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Because he was killed in his last battle
with the troops of Tuscany.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. And how do you know that?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Because I was there.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. By heavens, I guessed it!
didn't I?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Guessed what?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. That you were one of his
people.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Say that again, and by heavens,
I'll split your skull in two. I will let you know
who I am, I am the forester of the next frontier
town, and was ordered out against that thief
Rinaldini, with all my people. We had very
hot work; and now as we have destroyed him,
you treat me as if&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Well, well, I beg your pardon.
A man may&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Come, less argument, and more
liquor! Well, that is one, now for number two!
Now show me your passports: we have lately

<!-- page 55 -->

had very strict orders to take up all such vagabonds
as you.</p>

<p><i>A Woman</i>. 'Tis excellent liquor! Entirely at
your honour's service!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I take no presents, and know my
duty.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Why not? Do let me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Come, once more, old woman!</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. With all my heart, good
Mr. Forester.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is that your daughter, old Shrivel-skin?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. The little one is. The tall
one is a relation, a poor fatherless and motherless
girl. Come hither child! She is named
after her godmother Rosalia, is a good Christian,
seventeen years old, and has an excellent
heart!&mdash;Shall I pour out another glass?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With all my heart!</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Rosalia, give Mr. Forester a
piece of rice-cake!</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Here, here, Forester! Much good
may it do you!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Hark ye, my maid, are you really
christened?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Heaven forgive your disbelief!
Yes, indeed she was regularly christened
at Macerata, as her certificate will prove.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Yes certainly I was! I was!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now what am I indebted to you ?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Oh, by his holiness! not a
doit. We will not take any money of you, good
Mr. Forester!</p>

<!-- page 56 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I cannot accept presents. Come,
out with your passports! what have you in
these panniers? What, the deuce! How came
you by these large wax candles? You must
certainly have stolen them?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. God forbid! Mr. Forester!
What do you take us for? Stolen, indeed! No,
we paid good hard money for them!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what use do you make of these
church candles?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. By night, Mr. Forester, when
the weather is dark and stormy, in the woods;
and when&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will buy two of them.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. They are at your service.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will also buy your bread.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. With all my heart!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now reckon what I owe you.
Come show me your passports! Will you sell
me the whole bottle of liquor?</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Man</i>. Mr. Forester is a good customer!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes, I will buy every thing that
pleases me. I will buy this girl, if you will sell
her, and she has no objection.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. In what capacity?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As my housekeeper. I want just
such a girl as you.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. If I can earn my wages I will go
with you immediately.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I mean so.</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. You shall have her. I will
sell her for three ducats.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will give only two.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Well, take her! But with
one condition, that you shall not ask us for our
passports!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Aha! Very well! But beware that
you do not fall into the hands of the militia, for
they are out to-day.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. We shall soon get out of the
wood.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I would advise you to do so. Here
is the money for the girl; and here are a couple
of pauls* for my reckoning.</p>

<p class="small">[*A piece of money worth about 5<i>s</i>. 3-8.]</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Thank you, Mr. Forester!</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Good bye! good bye!</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. Behave yourself well, and
don't shame us. What is the name of the
place, Mr. Forester, where you are going to
take her?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To Sarsiglia, where I am forester.
My name is Benvenuto Fromiglia: the whole
town knows me.</p>

<p><i>Gipsey Woman</i>. We only ask that we may
know where to find her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Very well! God bless you!</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Adieu!</p>

<p>The Gipsies now loaded their beast, and began
to set forward.</p>

<p>Rosalia took up her bundle, and accompanied
Rinaldo, who pursued his way toward the ruined
castle, and was very gay and happy.</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>Rosalia expressed her wonder at the ruins,
remarked it would make an excellent habitation
for gipsies, and laid herself down near
Rinaldo, who had extended himself on the
grass.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And are you really come with me
willingly?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Yes; or else I would not be so
cheerful. The life I have hitherto led has
long been wearisome to me; and I had formed
a plan of some time or other leaving my companions
in the night, only I did not know where
to go. But this is better.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who knows whether it will be
better or worse?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Why so? A gipsey girl is but a
poor wretch! One must turn one's hand to
something, or one cannot get one's bread. If
one is once caught stealing, it is all over; and
they give us no quarters between heaven and
earth.&mdash;But if I am your housekeeper&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will not deceive you; I am no
forester.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Oh, heavens! then what are you!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You may still rejoin your company,
if you are not inclined to stay with me. I will
not detain you: you are perfectly free. Thus
you see I deal fairly with you; and I will even
be so imprudent as to tell you who I am&mdash;I
am Rinaldini!</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Oh, heavens! what shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Go back, and join your company, I
give you full permission to do so.</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Ah! what a famous man! I am
quite frightened, for you are so great a man,
and I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Be not uneasy. Here are ten
ducats, which I make you a present of.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Oh, stay, let me but think a while!
Shall I, or shall I not? Well, come what may&mdash;I'll
stay with you!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Will you indeed?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Yes I will.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Very well! You shall see I will
be careful of you; and when I am well off you
shall be so too, and shall want for nothing I
can procure you. Give me your hand, and
promise to stay with me!</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I do. Here is my hand!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your open countenance prejudices
me in your favour, and I give you my whole
confidence. You may therefore believe that I
wish to be worthy of yours.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Rinaldini! though you are so terrible
a man, I will not be afraid, but will stay
with you, and serve you faithfully. It seems
as if I had already known you long, and we
were old acquaintances.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So it is with me; and that is the
reason why I repose so much confidence in you.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. You are very kind! The more
confidence you place in me, the happier I am
with you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will tell you all. Just as you see
me here I escaped from an engagement with the
troops of Tuscany, which but few of my men

<!-- page 60 -->

survived. I am now quite alone, and do not expect
again to see the remainder of my company.
Fortune, perhaps, has separated me from
them for my good. I am informed by a peasant,
that the Tuscans believe I was killed in
the battle; and I am very glad they think so.
Perhaps they mistook me for my friend Severro,
who resembled me, and whose head being cut
open, they saw him fall; or perhaps some of
my men, who might be wounded and taken prisoners,
have given out that I am killed to secure
me from pursuit. I wish all Italy may believe
it! Amid these ruins I will pass a couple
of days, till the soldiers are gone, and then we
will approach certain places where I have buried
some gold. If we only find three of them
undiscovered, we shall have enough to live on
and will take ship, abandon Italy, sail to some
foreign country, and there pass our lives together
in peace.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. That is an excellent plan; and I
would give any thing to see it completed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well, we will endeavour to accomplish
it.</p>

<p>Thus this new alliance was concluded, and
sealed with a breakfast; after which Rinaldo
conducted his companion into an inner chamber
of the castle, and lighted the two candles he
had bought, to examine the place to which the
stairs under the trap-door led.</p>

<p>Having descended these, they came to a spacious
vault, which seemed to be the vestibule
of one much larger.&mdash;This they examined, and

<!-- page 61 -->

found quite empty; and at the end of it they
came to another staircase leading up to a trap-door
which stood open, and led into a small
court grown over with grass. Here they crept
through a narrow opening, which seemed once
to have served as a door-way into a small apartment,
of which the window shutters were shut.
They approached a side door, which was bolted,
and which they opened while two snakes hissed
by them. At first they started back; but again
proceeded, and entered a small room; from
which, however, they instantly returned, in
consequence of a dreadful smell that assailed
them. But Rinaldo re-entering, found two
corpses lying on the earth, in a state of corruption.
They were quite naked, and covered with
blood.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is the abode of murderers!"
as he left the apartment, and again shut
the door.</p>

<p>This horrid discovery made him uneasy; and
turning to Rosalia, he said,</p>

<p>"Here we must not stay long, I thought these
ruins had been the haunt of snakes and owls,
and now I find a den of assassins."</p>

<p>Rosalia drew back with horror; nor did Rinaldo
long delay ere he returned with her the
way they came, and hastened out of the
castle as if they had been pursued. They
were scarcely arrived in the open court before
a gun was heard, the ball of which passed between
them. Rinaldo took his gun, and fired

<!-- page 62 -->

on the bush whence the shot seemed to proceed.</p>

<p>Upon this he heard a loud curse and a rustling
noise; and instantly an armed man presented
himself, and said in a thundering voice,</p>

<p>"Here no one dares resist! I am Baptistello,
captain of a formidable band of men who are the
terror of the whole country."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah! do I at last see thee, thou terrible
Baptistello! of whom I have so often
heard? Are you he?</p>

<p><i>Baptistello</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now, then, learn that I will not
yield a hair's breadth to you. I am as much
dreaded as you; I am Rinaldini, who never yet
knew fear!</p>

<p><i>Baptistello</i>. Ah! do we meet here? Know
that we do not meet only to exchange these empty
words! I am jealous of your fame; and this
rencounter can only end in the destruction of one
of us. That I will not submit to you, you
may easily imagine: so draw your sabre, and
show if you have any skill to use it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That you shall experience. But let
your men come out from their ambush!</p>

<p><i>Baptistello</i>. I am quite alone, he that conquers
shall be the other's heir.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Mine is this young woman.</p>

<p><i>Baptistello</i>. Agreed, I will suffer her to go;
and, besides, make her a present. Let your men
come forward!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. They are above half a league off. </p>

<p><i>Baptistello</i>. Come, then, draw!</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>Rinaldo now threw down his arms, and took
off his hunting pouch, while Rosalia's eyes were
filled with tears.&mdash;Rinaldo saw them not, but
drew his sabre, and quickly went up to Baptistello,
who already stood in a posture to receive
him, which he did with coolness and courage.&mdash;Stroke
followed stroke, parried and returned
alternately by each. The combat continued
some minutes. Rinaldo grew hotter and hotter:
but Baptistello still remained cool and
collected. Rinaldo no longer saw nor heard
any thing, but furiously raged against his adversary,
who, unperceived by him, drew out a pistol
with his left hand, which he hid behind his
back, and fired at Rinaldo, but missed him.</p>

<p>"Villain!" cried Rinaldo, and drawing a pistol
from his girdle, shot his adversary through
the head. Baptistello fell, and Rosalia screamed
aloud. Baptistello gave up the ghost without
speaking a single word, and Rinaldo wrapped
him up, and threw him into the bush from
which he had fired at him.</p>

<p>Here he found a bundle, which he took up
and gave to Rosalia; besides which he took a
ring from his finger and a box of gold from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, Rosalia," cried he, "let us depart before
the villain's companions come."</p>

<p>Having proceeded about a league and a half,
they found a retired spot in the thickest part of
the wood that covered the sides of a hill, at the
foot of which a silver stream murmured down
the declivity. In the middle of the hill was an


open place, where they reposed themselves, and
talked of this bloody rencounter.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now counted over the gold he had
found upon his adversary, amounting to above
two hundred ducats, beside some gold medals
and pocket-pieces. Meanwhile Rosalia examined
the bundle, which contained a hermit's
frock, a couple of false noses, a beard and some
linen, which came very apropos for both of
them.</p>

<p>Upon this they took a frugal repast; and
having conversed on various subjects, passed the
night in this retired and beautiful scene.</p>

<div class="center">

<h3>BOOK II.</h3>

</div>

<p>THE sun was now risen, and our adventurers
were proceeding on their way. At first they
approached nearer to the road, but soon changed
their course, and perceived, as they were
quitting it, a peasant coming toward them,
who, on seeing them, doubled his pace. Rosalia
hurried back into the forest: but Rinaldo stood
and waited for the peasant, who, at a few paces
distance, cried out aloud,</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome, my long-lost friend and
captain."</p>

<p>Rinaldo knew the voice, and soon perceived
that the man who expressed so much joy at
seeing him, was his brave companion Cinthio.

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>They immediately embraced affectionately;
and Rosalia, trembling with fear, approached.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And do I see you again, my brave
Cinthio? And have you really escaped from the
slaughter?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Fortunately I have! Altaverde, myself,
and young Steffano, together with you, are
all that have escaped out of forty-nine. We
three, all wounded, but myself the least, were
driven over the mountain. Mattheo, with his
troop, were harrassed at the pass of Caprile;
and, therefore, to be nearer the frontiers, removed
over the heights of Perla, where we met
him, and related our misfortune. There was no
time to lose. We attacked a post of militia, left
eight men upon the field, and cut our way through
into this forest.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And have you taken up your abode
here?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. We have.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Lead me to the brave fellows&mdash;I
know an excellent place for us!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. And who is this girl?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She belongs to me.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then welcome to our party!</p>

<p>They now proceeded to the place where
Mattheo and his companions had pitched their
tents. Here Rinaldo was received with the
greatest joy, and related his battle with Baptistello.</p>

<p>" 'Twas a brave action, Captain," cried Mattheo,
"to destroy such a villain!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo now described to them the ruins,

<!-- page 66 -->

and they immediately struck their tents to
remove thither. Having taken up their quarters
there, they began to prepare for their next
meal.</p>

<p>Toward evening the sentinels gave the alarm;
upon which they all seized their arms, and advanced
to meet a troop that was approaching,
and which consisted of ten men belonging to
Baptistello's band. They soon came to an engagement
and the adverse party were worsted.
Six of them were killed on the spot: the remaining
four submitted, took an oath of fidelity to
Rinaldo, and were received into his band; upon
which a feast was given, that continued till a late
hour at night.</p>

<p>"It is of importance to us," said Rinaldo, after
passing a couple of joyful days in the castle,
"to learn the state of affairs in Florence, and
hear some news of our comrades. I have determined
to seek this information myself, and shall
therefore to-morrow leave you for a short time;
but I hope to see you soon again. Till then let
Altaverde be your commander, and Mattheo and
Cinthio his assistants."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the strong representations
made to him of the danger he would incur, Rinaldo
persisted in his intentions, and early the
following morning mounted a beautiful horse,
being handsomely dressed, and attended by Rosalia,
as his servant, in boy's clothes, upon a
mule.</p>

<p>He pursued the road to Oriolo, and hastened

<!-- page 67 -->

toward the mountain to pay a visit to his friend
Donato.</p>

<p>The soldiers had now returned to their quarters,
believing they had entirely exterminated
Rinaldini's hand. Thus the frontiers were open
and unguarded, and the morning being extremely
hot, when Rinaldo approached the
hermitage, Donato was sitting before the door.
On hearing the tread of horses he arose, and
was advancing when Rinaldo presented himself.
Donato did not immediately know him,
as his countenance was disguised; yet he felt a
kind of suspicion, which led him to examine his
visiter's face more narrowly than usual.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. God be with you!</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And with you!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am glad to see you well, my dear
friend.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Do you know me then?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes; we know each other.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Are you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can you not guess who I am.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I suspect:&mdash;and are you still alive?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As you see.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. They say you are certainly dead.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So much the better! You see,
however, I am still in the land of the living.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And how did you escape from that
bloody affray?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A man may cut his way through, if
he does not fall, and that was my case.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And your people?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A third part of them bit the earth.</p>

<!-- page 68 -->

<p><i>Donato</i>. 'Tis said above a hundred men.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Believe but half that number: for
that is quite enough.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And what would you here now?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. See you once more before I quit
Italy.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What I have said.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. And in some other country&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will live in peace and tranquillity,
do as much good as I can, and no longer
head a band of robbers.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. May heaven bless and favour your
resolution!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And now I come to take up my
quarters with you, to eat and drink with you
and not depart till to-morrow.</p>

<p>The horse and
mule were now unsaddled, the bags brought into
Donato's room, and his guests sealed. He
brought out whatever he had to eat and drink,
and Rosalia, who in her present dress was called
Rosetto, undertook to dress the victuals.</p>

<p>Towards evening Rinaldo and Donato sat
before the door, and observed the thunder
clouds that collected around the mountain and
veiled its summit. Lightning darted along the
sultry horizon, and the echo repeated and redoubled
the distant thunder. Presently fell a
few drops of rain, which soon increased to a
very heavy shower, and drove them into the
hermitage, where they seated themselves at
the table, while Rosalia poured out the wine.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now my friend, since this is probably

<!-- page 69 -->

the last time we shall ever meet, do me
the favour no longer to conceal the truth; but
tell me where is Aurelia?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I swear by heaven she is no longer in
this neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she in a convent?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. No; her father has taken her
away.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who is her father?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. My friend, whom you saw when you
last departed hence&mdash;the knight of Malta and
prince of Rocella.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And I suspect the lady in the nun's
dress is her mother.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. She is so; and after the birth of her
daughter retired to the convent; for her lover,
the father of her child, is a knight of Malta.*
He has now taken his daughter with him, in order
to marry her to advantage.</p>

<p class="small">[*The knights of Malta are under a vow of perpetual
celibacy.&mdash;<i>T</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you related to him?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I am his uncle.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are, perhaps&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I am an exiled Roman, of a noble
family, that has been forced to yield to the
power of faction and Nepotism,&dagger; the usurpations
and oppressions of which they resisted.</p>

<p class="small">[&dagger;A word used to describe the factions arising from
the power and influence of the relations of the Pope.&mdash;<i>T</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can I be of service to you in opposing
your enemies?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I have forgiven them, and leave their
punishment to heaven.</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you in want of money?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. By no means; besides, you have
lately sent me presents without my permission.
We are now drinking some of the wine you
gave me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is Aurelia happy?</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. I hope and believe she is. But are
you not afraid to travel alone, in a country where
spies are every where watching for you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am not without protection; except
against myself.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. You are a formidable man.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And fear no one but myself.</p>

<p><i>Donato</i>. Then you have to contend with a
formidable enemy whom you will never vanquish.</p>

<p>At break of day Rinaldo took leave of his
host, and having left him a letter of protection,
went in search of a place, where he had buried
some money, which he fortunately found again;
and was about to mount his horse, when he perceived
a capuchin approach. He presently discovered
him to be Amadeo, who in this disguise
was seeking his companions, and they immediately
embraced, and had much to relate to each
other. During a hearty breakfast, of which
the capuchin had great need, Rinaldo wrote a
letter to his people, which he sent by Amadeo to
Altaverde. It was to the following effect:</p>

<p class="small">"Circumstances oblige me to go a greater
distance than I expected. It will therefore be
some time before I see you again. Should your
present abode become unsafe or ineligible, go

<!-- page 71 -->

back to the Appenines, where you may now remain
undisturbed. Endeavour to increase your
numbers, and be prudent. I am on the road to
strike a great stroke. Above all things I recommend
to you unanimity, and the total annihilation
of Baptistello's band."</p>

<p>With these instructions Amadeo proceeded
by the road which Rinaldo described, to join
his companions; while the latter took his way
over San Benedetto to Sarsina, on his road to
Cesena. He soon fell in with Nicolo and Sebastiano,
who had quitted the forest of Basino
and reached the frontiers without impediment.
Nicolo received instructions how to find his companions,
and Sebastiano continued with Rinaldo
as his coachman. For he purchased a coach
and four mules at Sarsina, his baggage becoming
heavier and heavier, in consequence of the treasure
he had dug up in various places. Rosalia
accompanied him in the carriage, and he travelled
as the Count of Dalbrogo.</p>

<p>At Cesena he found a mountebank singing
the acts of Rinaldini, in the public square, under
a painted canopy. The multitude who
crowded around him, listened to him with the
greatest attention, and Rinaldo joined the circle
to hear what was said of him. When the
mountebank had sung several stanzas, he pulled
his hat off and cried, "Let us say a paternoster,
my Christian brethren, for the poor repentant
Rinaldini."</p>

<p>Upon this they all uncovered and prayed;
and Rinaldo, to avoid observation, also joined in

<!-- page 72 -->

this prayer himself. The mountebank now
threw his hat down among the audience, saying,
"I also am a poor Christian; blessed be they
that give!"</p>

<p>One of the company took up the hat and received
in it a shower of small coin, and Rinaldo
threw in some silver, which drew from one of
his neighbours an exclamation of "Bravo Christiano!"
When the hat came back to its owner,
he gathered the money, put it in his pocket,
and placing his hat upon his head, sang three or
four more stanzas.</p>

<p>The audience, who were all much moved,
except Rinaldo, now dispersed, while the mountebank
packed up his little stage and removed
to another square to repeat the same performance.
Many of the company followed him to
hear once more this interesting story.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo turned to one of his
neighbours, who seemed to be a magistrate or
person of consequence, and asked him,</p>

<p>"Is Rinaldini really dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other; "and God be
merciful to his sinful soul! His death is certain."</p>

<p>"Where then did he die?"</p>

<p>"In the mountains; in a battle with the militia
of Tuscany. His head is now on a pole
before the town-house of Pienza."</p>

<p>"That is very good news!"</p>

<p>"Certainly; for he was the terror of all
Tuscany and Lombardy. 'Tis much to be lamented

<!-- page 73 -->

that he employed his courage and his
talents to no better purpose."</p>

<p>A Franciscan monk offered to say a couple
of masses for Rinaldini's soul, and received the
money for that purpose. Rinaldo gave him
something toward it, and thus contributed to his
own obsequies while yet alive.</p>

<p>On the following day, when he was about to
leave Cesena, he perceived the above mentioned
knight of Malta coming toward him,
and, as it was impossible to avoid a meeting,
went directly up to him and took him by the
hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Prince, I am in your power."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" returned the prince with astonishment,
"is it possible? have you really thus
escaped?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You see I am still alive.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. From me you have nothing to fear. I
am no police officer.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Should it ever in the course of my
life be in my power to serve you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. No ceremonies! Only take care of
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Every one believes I am dead, and
they are singing my untimely end in every
street.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. So much the better for you; but do
you venture thus openly and alone?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Imagine not I am alone. My people
accompany me in a hundred different shapes,
and my apprehension would cause a torrent of
blood.</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p><i>Prince</i>. How? Have you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have sixty of the most resolute fellows
with me in this very town.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. You astonish me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Rather pity me. I am now going
to Venice on my way to the mountains of the
Tyrol: and who knows whether I shall ever arrive
there?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Will you never abandon this course
of life?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will. In Germany I intend to dismiss
my troop, should I be so fortunate as to arrive
there. But where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. To Urbino.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. There I shall see you again; but
meanwhile permit me to ask you, is your
daughter happy?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. How? Do you know the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Donato is my friend.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Yes; she is happily married.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. God bless her! Prince, my people
fell in with your mules and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Silence on that subject.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do me the favour to accept from me
this ring. If you will not wear it yourself give
it to Aurelia.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. As a remembrance from so great a
man, I will accept it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thank you: and as you intend to
travel so far, I also request your acceptance, of
this letter; in consequence of which my people
will respect you wherever you may meet them.</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p><i>Prince</i>. Well! I will also accept this present&mdash;but,
sincerely, how strong are you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am as strong as an army. I have
eight hundred men under my orders throughout
Italy. From Savoy to Naples ten captains
command them, and I am their generalissimo.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Oh! how much have you to answer
for!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Only for what I myself command.
Fare you well!</p>

<p>Thus saying he went and ordered his carriage,
but prudently took neither the road to
Venice nor Urbino; but by another way returned
to the forest.</p>

<p>This time, however, Rinaldo did not visit
Donato, but having sold his mules, sent forward
Sebastiano, and restoring his money to a
place of security, set forward for the Appenine
mountains.</p>

<p>Here he found an empty hermitage, which
seemed to have been recently deserted, as appeared
by some fresh writing that lay on the
table, to the following effect:</p>

<p>"Whoever thou art that shall succeed me,
and chose this hermitage for thy abode, mayest
thou be as happy as I who have hitherto
inhabited it, and have written this paper, which
I request you in like manner to leave behind
you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo had scarcely read this, before a
thought struck him, to live there for a while in
the character of a hermit. He immediately

<!-- page 76 -->

put on his hermit's dress, and Rosalia acted as
housekeeper; though their mode of life, particularly
their table and cellar, were far more
luxurious than a hermit usually enjoys.</p>

<p>Two days after they arrived here, as Rinaldo
was taking his morning walk, he saw a man
sitting on an eminence and drawing. Having
therefore approached and accosted him, he inquired
what he was about.</p>

<p>"I am taking a view of this place," said he,
"because it has of late acquired great celebrity."
"How so?" "Do you not know? This
is the spot where Rinaldo died. Under that
tree his head was cut open, and he expired
immediately. A soldier, who was in the engagement,
gave me a full description of the
place. When I have made my drawing and
engraved it, I shall sell it prettily coloured, and
make a great profit. Another plate will contain
the battle, which will doubtless sell very
well. In the view I am now taking, I shall introduce
a gallows near the tree I have just
mentioned, as an emblem of the subject."</p>

<p>"An excellent speculation!"</p>

<p>"Aye, that is the way of the world. Such
incidents are always beneficial to the arts."</p>

<p>Rinaldo wished him a good sale for his pictures,
and left him. Yet he could not help
feeling some pain at the emblem which was to
serve as his monument.</p>

<p>As he returned to his hermitage he heard a
noise there; on listening to which, he perceived

<!-- page 77 -->

some voices speaking in a threatening tone,
and Rosalia weeping.</p>

<p>He instantly entered the room, where he
saw Rosalia, crying on a bench, and two ill-looking
fellows about to break open cupboard,
upon which they were so intent that they did
not hear Rinaldo come in. The latter gave
Rosalia the wink to be silent, and suddenly advancing,
threw one of them on the ground, and
seized a pistol belonging to the other, which lay
on the table. Rosalia suddenly took up a musket
from behind a chair, and, springing forward,
attacked the other thief, who, astonished and confounded,
let fall the tool with which he was breaking
open the cupboard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo applying the pistol to the
breast of the man who was down, called to the
other,</p>

<p>"Lay down your arms."</p>

<p>Rosalia also called out to him, repeating these
orders, and added,</p>

<p>"Lay them down, you villain, or I will shoot
you dead."</p>

<p>Both the robbers were now disarmed, and Rinaldo
asked them with the utmost coolness and
tranquillity.</p>

<p>"What is your business here? who are you?"</p>

<p>"Behave with respect," replied the one "we
belong to Rinaldini."</p>

<p>"Never, never," said Rinaldini, "such actions
his people never would commit. No, no,
you are thieves, of whom Rinaldini knows as
little as you or him. Villains that you are,

<!-- page 78 -->

kneel down and ask pardon&mdash;I, I myself am Rinaldini."</p>

<p>On this they both knelt down, full of terror,
and embraced his knees.</p>

<p>"Pardon! Captain," said the one hesitating,
"we did not know you, but we have really belonged
to your people these three days. Altaverde
and Cinthio themselves enlisted us. We
deserve punishment by your laws; punish us as
you please."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was about to answer, when the door
opened, and Cinthio entered.</p>

<p>"You have been enlisting some pretty rascals
here!" cried Rinaldo.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. The devil! what! you here. Captain!
and in a hermit's frock. I never should have
expected it. How I rejoice to see you again!
But what is the use of these reliques! Are you
performing your noviciate?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do these men know our laws?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. They have heard them read.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And have they sworn to them?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. They have.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This young woman was left here
alone, and when I entered, these men were
breaking open the cupboard.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. And besides, I showed them a letter
of protection from Rinaldini himself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. A thousand curses on them! and not
to respect your Captain's written order! holla!
comrades, come in, bind these villains to yonder

<!-- page 79 -->

tree and shoot them.&mdash;They have violated
their Captain's letter of protection.</p>

<p>"Curses on the assassins!" cried the robbers,
who had instantly entered on Cinthio's
calling them; and immediately seized and took
them out. Thus having bound them to a tree,
and firing eight musket balls at them, they blew
out their brains.</p>

<p>This incident occasioned Rinaldo to leave the
hermitage. Meanwhile Cinthio collected his
people together, and being twenty in number,
they descended into the valley, and so to the
mountain of Fortini, where Altaverde was stationed
with a party of sixty men, he having remarked
some movements in the ecclesiastical
state, tending to their expulsion from the forest
they had hitherto occupied.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now ordered his tent on the summit of
the highest hill toward Belsorte, to be struck,
mustered his band which he found to be eighty
strong, and removed to a mountain which commanded
Brancolino.</p>

<p>A few days afterward came Altaverde, and
joined him. "Captain," said he, "we begin to
be in great want of provisions."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It must be remedied.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. The men murmur at it, and begin
to complain of their inactivity.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then we must find them employment.</p>

<p><i>Altaverde</i>. Certainly. And besides money is
very scarce with some of them, who have lost at
play.</p>

<!-- page 80 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well, here are two hundred sequins,
which I will distribute among the men. Employment
they shall also have. Let the whole
troop be assembled this evening. I will assign
them their parts.</p>

<p>When evening came the band assembled in
the appointed valley, where Rinaldo joined them
in his Captain's uniform, and ordered them to
form a circle round him. This they silently performed,
leaned on their muskets, and waited
with the greatest expectation to hear what their
commander would say.</p>

<p>"Comrades," said Rinaldo, "I am informed
your provisions begin to fail, and it is fit we
should take measures to procure a fresh supply;
but this must be done with prudence. I therefore
divide among you two hundred sequins of
my own property."</p>

<p>"Long live our Captain," cried they all, till
the mountains re-echoed with the sound.</p>

<p>Rinaldo having taken off his hat and again
covered himself, proceeded;&mdash;</p>

<p>"With this money let provisions be bought
in the neighbouring towns, and those of you
who are best acquainted with the places may
perform this commission in the dress of hermits.
On this subject they may communicate with
Altaverde, who will superintend the whole.
In five or six days I will speak to you again,
and hope then to lead you forth to a great enterprise.
Meanwhile Cinthio may enter the
frontier forest by the great road, accompanied
by twelve of you, and return with wine and

<!-- page 81 -->

fruit, or oil; he knows what he is to do. I
will give him money to pay the poor carriers
for whatever he may take of them; besides
which, he will admonish them to silence under
the strongest threats. The carriages and mules
must not be taken from them.&mdash;But if an idle
prelate, or such person, come in your way, take
from them what they have in money and money's
worth. But I again recommend your sparing
all poor travellers and hermits. Every violation
of this rule I will punish, as you know,
with death. Now depart to your various stations,
and so farewell!"</p>

<p>Having said this, Rinaldo left them, and a
loud cry of joy pursued him as he went.</p>

<p>When he returned to his tent he found Rosalia
sitting in a corner, full of terror and alarm.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Oh! I tremble from head to foot.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What has happened?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I have twice seen a white figure.
The second time it looked into the tent, raised
its hand, and threatened with its finger. I
thank God you are returned.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, without saying a word, made a signal,
on which, some of his people came in,
among whom was Cinthio.&mdash;Rinaldo informed
them what Rosalia had seen, and immediately
gave orders to post guards all around the
mountain, at the same time sending Sebastiano
to Altaverde, whom he informed what had happened,
and instructed to be on the watch.</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>They all went to their posts, and Rinaldo
threw himself on his bed, having first lighted an
additional lamp. Rosalia sat by him and played
on the guitar.</p>

<p>She had not sung many stanzas before the
white figure came into the tent, and Rosalia
screamed aloud, "Jesu Maria! there it is!"
and Rinaldo rising, asked, "Who art thou?"
but receiving no answer, he seized a pistol, and
taking aim at the figure, said</p>

<p>"If you are a ghost expect this ball."</p>

<p>The figure still threatened with the finger,
and Rinaldo pulled the trigger; but his pistol
though an excellent one, missed fire, and, as he
again cocked it, the figure disappeared. Rinaldo
sprung up and hurried out; but could not
see any thing. Immediately a gun went off in
the valley, then a second, then a third.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now hastened down the hill to his
sentinels, three of whom had seen a white
figure, at which they had fired. Upon this a
general alarm was spread, with horns and fifes;
and immediately the whole corps was assembled.</p>

<p>After relating to each other what they had
seen and continuing some time together, they
again separated, and Rinaldo returned to his
tent; where he and Rosalia having drunk
some wine, they lay down. Rosalia soon fell
asleep, but Rinaldo thus communed with himself,</p>

<p>"History affords various examples of similar
appearances foretelling the fall of great men.

<!-- page 83 -->

Brutus was forewarned by a ghost, who spoke
to him; this figure, however, preserved a perfect
silence. Yet it threatened with its finger&mdash;was
this to me?&mdash;but it first threatened Rosalia,
when she sat alone in the tent. To her
first, to me afterwards:&mdash;this was not imagination;
five of us saw it. My best pistol missed
fire, which it never did before, and my men,
who did fire, missed their aim, though they can
always hit their man. How wonderful! Yet
wherefore should I be afraid?&mdash;afraid?&mdash;no, that I
will never be."</p>

<p>Unable to sleep, he sprang up, threw on his
cloak, and descended into the valley, where he
drank and conversed with his sentinels; and
began to joke on what had passed.</p>

<p>The sun now rising he feasted his eyes on
the magnificent scenery it afforded, at the same
time saying to himself with a sigh:</p>

<p>"Yet it rises not to me so beautiful as when
I tended my father's goats."</p>

<p>Nicolo now came running up to him, and crying
out:</p>

<p>"Captain, we have taken some loads of provisions
belonging to the rich monks of Mangolo,
for which reason we have paid nothing for
them. If the monks wish to be paid, they may
apply to you. But the best of the story is,
that we made a friar that accompanied it say a
paternoster for us all, and give us absolution,
which he did with a lamentable voice, and then
we let him go."</p>

<p>"This incident will make a noise," said Rinaldo,

<!-- page 84 -->

and returned in pensive mood to his tent,
where Rosalia was already risen and preparing
chocolate.</p>

<p>Rinaldo seated himself to breakfast before
his tent, and viewed the misty vale, from which,
as the sun became more powerful, the fog departed,
and the distant plains displayed themselves
in all their varied beauties to his view.</p>

<p>He now looked through his glass at the intersecting
roads, and found them all clear, except
a carriage which was moving slowly on;
calling therefore to Sebastiano, he instructed
him to see what it was, and the latter immediately
flew to execute his commands.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now fixed his eyes on a castle at no
great distance, which, without being able to
account for it, had particularly attracted his
attention: he resolved to take a nearer view
of it. He therefore dressed himself in a green
hunter's dress, edged with gold, put on a hat
adorned with feathers, took his double-barrelled
gun, and, accompanied by his dog, descended
the hill, and took the road that led to the
castle.</p>

<p>To the right was a monastery inhabited by
well-fed Benedictines; before the door of
which a monk was walking to and fro, and
reading.</p>

<p>Having saluted each other, they entered into
the following conversation:</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You seem to contemplate me with
wonder? at what are you surprised?</p>

<!-- page 85 -->

<p><i>Monk</i>. I am wondering to see you travelling
alone, as if you had nothing to fear?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what should I fear?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Do you not know these mountains are
infested with banditti?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have not heard of them.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Yes, it is perfectly true; we have
found it true by experience. They have taken
from us a quantity of wine, and Father Barnard,
who accompanied it, was obliged to absolve
the villains. Such an absolution, however, being
compulsory, cannot avail: and the vagabonds
will pay dearly for their joke.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How so?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. The rascals will not only be formally
excommunicated by us, but we shall also give intelligence
of the event, and a body of men will
be sent out against them that will ferret them
out of all their holes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then blood will flow.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. The more their blood flows the better
for injured mankind.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Will money and good words purchase
a breakfast of you?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Most assuredly; walk in.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I would rather have it in the open
air; and then return up the mountain, since you
tell me the road is not safe.</p>

<p>Upon this the monk left him, and soon returned
with a lay-brother, who brought a bottle of
wine and some pastry.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Do you live in this neighbourhood?</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am on a visit with a friend, whose
castle is not far.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Aha! you have not heard then of the
famous Rinaldini?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He was killed in a skirmish. I
heard a circumstantial account of his death at
Cesena.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. So it is reported; yet some maintain
that this Proteus is still alive, and indeed, a true
Proteus he must be; for he goes about in a thousand
various forms.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you not know him?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. God forbid! If we knew where to
meet with him, we would endeavour to purchase
from him a letter of protection for us and our
property.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And how much would you give
him?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. We have offered him an hundred
sequins, and broke off because he demanded
more.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But suppose you gave the money to
the soldiers who are sent out against him?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. That would avail but little, for his
troops are always increasing, though they have
been frequently half destroyed. Besides, he is
above five hundred strong.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Heavens! and how does this man
support so large a band?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. By robbery&mdash;they steal like crows.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But I should think, if proper
measures were adopted, this evil might be
eradicated.</p>

<!-- page 87 -->

<p><i>Monk</i>. Proper measures! how so?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. At least I think so.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Well! every man may have useful
ideas, be he layman or priest&mdash;but what do you
think ought to be done?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In my opinion government might effect
it.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. As for example?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A general pardon for Rinaldo and his
people!</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. God forbid!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. An invitation to return and mix in
civil society!</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. God defend us! who could associate
with such robbers and outlaws? We could not
even conscientiously bury a pious Christian by
the side of such a ruffian. Talk not then of
any man living with him in society&mdash;No, that
is impossible&mdash;the sins of this reprobate may
indeed be pardoned on his death bed, if he turn
to God; but hang he must without remission.
If he die in his sins and without absolution, the
devil will have his soul&mdash;but no man must, on
any account, hold communion with such a
miscreant.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And yet you yourself wish to hold
communion with him.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. How? God forbid!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Would you not buy of him a letter of
protection?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. That is not communion, but prudence.
Necessity has no law. We will buy of
him a protection, and then excommunicate him.

<!-- page 88 -->

Such men must be dealt with as the Heathens,
who know not God.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Suppose now I were Rinaldini, and
knew this your intention?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. God forbid!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am only supposing a case.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Well; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then would I&mdash;supposing I were
Rinaldini&mdash;you understand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then I would punish you all
severely.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. 'Tis well Rinaldini knows it not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. For he must be a very revengeful fellow:
but perhaps he is no more.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is highly probable. It is asserted
that his head is now exposed on a pole at
Pienza.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Is it so? But I am as much afraid of
his people as of himself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But who knows whether they have
his head?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Head! hem! that can be of little
use! What can the head of a goatherd avail
them?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In that respect nature may have
been more bountiful to him than to many a
prelate.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. He has never studied; and nature does
nothing alone. I presume you have gone through
your studies.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. At three different universities.</p>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p><i>Monk</i>. Indeed; Jurisprudence?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ethics, logic, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Aha! Very excellent studies! Are
you your own master?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am. At least I think so.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Have you any fortune?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A large one.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Riches are the gift of God. To
those he loves he gives gold; and, observe, a
good understanding to employ it properly. We
here are not so rich as we appear. We have
just enough to eat and drink, but no superfluities.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Superfluities are useless; they but
enervate mankind, and render them lethargic and
inactive. Your wine is good.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Oh yes; we have a good glass of wine&mdash;for
strangers. As for ourselves, we drink none;
or at least, very little.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then drink some with me!</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. I thank you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Come no ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Well, if you insist upon it&mdash;if you
positively will have it so&mdash;your health, noble
sir!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Good may it do you! Since we are
here together, let us empty a bottle between
us.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Well, I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have no objection, I presume?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Objection! O yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No ceremonies! But tell me, to
whom belongs yon beautiful castle?</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p><i>Monk</i>. It has lately come into the possession
of the Baron Rovezzo, who has lately purchased
it: but it formerly belonged to the house of
Altieri.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Does the Baron reside there?</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Both he and his lovely young bride,
whom he has lately brought home. She is a
quiet, good Christian, but the Baron is a little
wild. May I ask you your name?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Count Dalbrogo.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Dalbrogo! Dalbrogo! That is a family
from&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The Italian port of Switzerland.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Aha! from Switzerland?&mdash;So&mdash;</p>

<p>At this time Sebastiano slowly and silently
approaching them, Rinaldo gave him a wink,
and thus addressed him:</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither are you going traveller?</p>

<p><i>Sebastiano</i>. To the mountains where I live.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you live safe there?</p>

<p><i>Sebastiano</i>. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. They talk of robbers.</p>

<p><i>Sebastiano</i>. Where nothing is, nothing can
be lost. We have not much, at best. Within
such walls as these they would find a richer
booty.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. The little we have is the property of
the church.</p>

<p><i>Sebastiano</i>. On which you most heartily fatten!
Addio.</p>

<p><i>Monk</i>. Hark ye! this rogue has a very
suspicious look. Perhaps he is one of the
banditti.</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Mountaineers have generally a wild
look.</p>

<p>The clock now striking, the monk hastened
to rejoin the choir. Rinaldo therefore paid
his reckoning, and took his way toward the
castle.</p>

<p>Adjoining this edifice was a high wall, surrounding
a beautiful garden, where Rinaldo
finding a wicket open, immediately entered.
On approaching a small grove, he perceived a
lady, who hearing footsteps behind her, quickly
turned round; and perceiving Rinaldo screamed
aloud. The latter instantly recognized and
approached her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is it possible? Scarcely can I trust
my eyes! Is this imagination or reality? Aurelia&mdash;the
beautiful Aurelia here!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. The same!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Here?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. In the castle of my husband.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your husband! And are you really
married?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Yes, alas!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How! Tears in the eyes of Aurelia!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Oh! these signs of that misfortune
which pursues me throughout my life may convince
you how wretched I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Aurelia! and unhappily married!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Ah heavens!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah! when good old Donato&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. O, that I had been left to live in
solitude with him, or that I had remained in my

<!-- page 92 -->

foster father's farm. How happy had I been!
My good father, indeed, meant well, and wished
to make me happy: but&mdash;I am most wretched.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps the lovely Aurelia brought
with her here the source of her misfortune?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. How do you mean? My heart
was free. Innocent and pure was I, when I
came to my husband. My father gave me a
very large fortune; and for that alone my husband
married me. Ah, friend of the worthy
Donato! tell that venerable old man how miserable
I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Will you grant me your confidence
without reserve?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. My father knows you also, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What did your father say of me?
Do you know who I am?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. When he spoke of you to me, he
called you a celebrated man, but did not tell me
your name.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am the Count Dalbrogo; and
you know, already, I am your father's friend.
A short time ago, at Cesena, we exchanged
rings as a sign of friendship. Did he tell you
nothing of it?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. It is long since I saw or spoke
with him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Does he know you are unhappy?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. If he has received my letters he
must know it: but of that I am extremely
doubtful, since I have never received an answer
to any of them. Perhaps my husband, by
means of his spies, intercepts even my letters.</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well, me he can neither corrupt
nor intercept. I will speak to your father, and
will say to him whatever you desire me.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Will you, indeed?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will engage my word of honour.
What complaints have you against your husband?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. He is a tyrant to me, and treats me
with contempt. He breaks his nuptial faith
almost before my eyes, with mercenary wretches
whom he keeps here in his castle.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The villain.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. He plagues and torments me incessantly
with reproaches.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With what reproaches?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Ah, heaven! with my illegitimate
birth, which&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Ah! he knew that before
he married me!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you love him?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I loved him once: but now he has
compelled me to hate him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You hate him?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I abhor him as I do my sins. It
was but yesterday he exposed me to the ridicule
of his companions; and his mercenary
prostitutes make a jest of me. I am treated
like a slave!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You shall have satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I am fully resolved, if my father
does not soon interfere, to abandon this scene of
vice and debauchery, and to fly.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither will you fly?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. To my mother.</p>

<!-- page 94 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where is she?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. She is abbess of the convent of St.
Clara near Montamara.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. When first I beheld Aurelia in
that happy valley, and when I afterward conversed
with her at the peaceful hermitage of
Donato, I said to myself, "How happy will be
the man to whom Aurelia shall give her hand
and heart!" And now this excellent girl is
miserable!&mdash;No; by heavens! it shall not be.
At least she shall be revenged. Such is the
solemn oath of one who will keep his word&mdash;it
is the oath of Dalbrogo!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Ah, Count! why will you bring
yourself to destruction, perhaps, for my sake?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. For your sake I would engage
with monsters and with devils.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Count, you alarm me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How shall I know the wretch?
Is he in the castle?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. He is hunting with some of his companions.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who are they?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Adventurers from all corners of
the earth, whom he has collected round him,
and who are dissipating my fortune in debauchery,
gambling, drinking, and&mdash;&mdash;ah, heavens
they are very had men&mdash;two Frenchmen and
a Sicilian, who perhaps have escaped from
the hands of justice; they call themselves noble,
but that I am sure is false. You can
scarcely conceive with what indecency they
treat me. </p>

<!-- page 95 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By heavens, were I present, it
should be the last ill action they should commit.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Ah, Count! would you who are a
stranger?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My oath shall be fulfilled, and I will
revenge you. The riotous laughter of these villains
shall be changed to mourning, and you shall
have exemplary satisfaction, or my name&mdash;is not
Dalbrogo. But, of whom is the portrait that
hangs at your breast?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. It is the portrait of my husband.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Show it me. Is it like?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. A strong likeness.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well&mdash;Now I shall know him. But
away with this portrait from your bosom.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. By no means;&mdash;he would beat me if
I omitted to wear it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What!&mdash;Has he ever dared&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Ah, heavens! I now bear the marks of
his cruelty on my body.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Villain! Thou shalt soon bear the
marks of my retribution, which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Oh, heavens! there comes my husband
with his companions up the walk!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is too late to fly; stay, and I will
stay also; I am a friend of your father's, who
has commissioned me to visit you in his name.
In my presence he will not dare to insult you.
With a single word I could smite him to the
earth; and before morning dawns, you shall be
rescued.</p>

<p>The Baron and his companions now approached,

<!-- page 96 -->

and Rinaldo advancing a few steps
toward him took off his hat, saying,</p>

<p>"I am glad Baron, to make your acquaintance.
The Prince, your father-in-law, desires me to salute
you in his name, and to inform you that he
will speedily pay you a visit. I am his friend,
and Count Dalbrogo is my name."</p>

<p>"Your humble servant," replied the Baron
with great coldness. Then turning to Aurelia,
said, with a sarcastic smile, "Perhaps too an old
acquaintance of yours, and you have not invited
this agreeable visiter and messenger of good
news from your father into the castle?"</p>

<p>"Pardon," continued he, "the inattention of
my wife, but she has been brought up at a farm
house. That, however, you probably know already."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I do; she has been brought up with
very good and worthy people.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. So my father-in-law will soon pay us
a visit?&mdash;Has he not fixed the day of his arrival?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I believe you may expect him daily.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. That is unfortunate, for I have fixed a
journey for to-morrow, which I cannot possibly
defer.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He will expect your return. He said
he had many things to speak of with you.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. So&mdash;but unfortunately I, may be obliged
to be absent some months&mdash;perhaps you intend
to await his arrival here?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No&mdash;I have affairs of importance to
settle at Rome, and would therefore expedite

<!-- page 97 -->

my departure. Had you not returned as you did,
I should have been deprived of the pleasure of
seeing you. I was taking leave of your lady
when I learnt your arrival.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. But you will stay and take your dinner
with us?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I must beg to be excused.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. I entreat you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is impossible, my hours are all
counted.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. I regret that I had not the pleasure of
your acquaintance earlier. I hope my wife has
entertained you well; but I fear she has had one
of those fits of ill humour that so frequently attack
her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In fact&mdash;but excuse me&mdash;from the
state in which I found your wife, I should rather
attribute more to grief than ill humour. Meanwhile
I would not be indiscreet, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Yes, yes, she has the art of covering
her ill humour with the veil of grief, and calls
her obstinacy and caprice lowness of spirits.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yet she formerly appeared so gay
and happy that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Perhaps she is not married to your
liking. Sir Count, you are vexed she has fallen
to my lot.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Sir Baron, you joke.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Far from it; the simpleton, perhaps,
would have been better pleased, had she been
removed from the shepherd's field to your pasture:
she would then have remained as she was
before.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes, equally good, noble, and lovely.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Aye, in the eyes of a lover.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Baron, I remark with astonishment
and grief that your marriage is not happy.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. That you have, no doubt, learnt from
this paragon of sensibility; she bewails every
creature in the village.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By heavens! it grieves me that your
father-in-law must find things as they are.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. He may take her back if he pleases, or
restore her to her very honourable mother.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Baron this bitterness shows&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. That I would be rid of the fool, nothing
farther. Will you please to take her
with you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No insults, Baron, I will not bear
them.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. This warmth in the cause of my wife
proves&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That which it shall prove: nothing
more and nothing less. I am her father's friend,
who will certainly not permit&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. He may receive his jewel back. I
want her no more.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Nor do you deserve to possess her.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Thunder and lightning! Sir Count&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you mean.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Away with you, sir, and take this
strumpet with you, that she may no longer offend
my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your brutality&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Here I am master.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then be so of yourself. For all

<!-- page 99 -->

you have said and done you shall give me full
satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. In Rome.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Here in your castle.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Whenever you please.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This very day.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. This very moment. I will settle
your account for you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will settle yours for you, you
wretch!</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Such language shall be answered by
my servants with horse-whips.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. (<i>Putting his hand to his sword</i>.)
Draw!</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. How!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Draw, or I will cut you down.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. For God's sake, Count, be calm, you
do not know these men.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. (<i>Giving her a box on the ear</i>.) Silence!
now complain of that to your lover.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By heavens, Baron, that shall be repaid
with blood.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Leave my castle; or as this is my
right hand, I will order my people to turn you
out.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Cowardly villain! that you yourself
dare not do: Aurelia, you shall certainly be rescued.
As for you, villain! who call yourself her
husband, I shall this very day speak to you in a
way that you shall feel severely.</p>

<p>The Baron and his companions laughed aloud,
and as Rinaldo quitted the garden, cried out after
him.</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"A pleasant journey to you, Don Quixotte,
you may now go and tell your adventures to
your mamma."</p>

<p>The temper in which Rinaldo rejoined his
companions may easily be imagined. He was
scarcely able to contain himself. His appearance
made Rosalia tremble; for she had never beheld
him so before.</p>

<p>"Captain," said Cinthio, "what has happened?"</p>

<p>"That you shall learn," replied he; "call Altaverde
to me."</p>

<p>With him and Cinthio, Rinaldo now communed;
and when evening approached, Altaverde,
at the head of twenty men, descended
into the valley. Cinthio went towards the left
with sixteen, and ten accompanied Rinaldo.
Rosalia remained in the tent, which was safely
guarded by Nicolo.</p>

<p>These corps were in motion about the time
it grew dark: but they had scarcely left their
former post, when Sebastiano followed them
with five and twenty men, and stationed himself
near the Benedictine Monastery above
mentioned. Cinthio crossed the river, took
possession of the bridge, and posted himself by
the garden wall of Baron Rovezzo. Altaverde
occupied the high road, and that leading to the
village, and placed his men round the castle as
far as the post of Cinthio; and Rinaldo with his
party went up to the castle gate, which was
shut. On sounding the horn a servant unbolted
it, and inquired who was there? but he was

<!-- page 101 -->

seized by the throat, dragged out and delivered
to Altaverde's party; three men took possession
of the gate, and the rest followed Rinaldo
across the court yard, and made themselves
masters of the house door. Two others entered
the servants' hall with cocked pistols, and
commanded silence, which the servants, who
were terrified and trembling with fear, obeyed.</p>

<p>Rinaldo cut the string of the alarm bell with
his stiletto, and with three men went up stairs
to an apartment where the Baron was sitting at
a table with his companions and mistresses.</p>

<p>The door being half open, Rinaldo listened,
and heard that he himself, under the name of
Count Dalbrogo, was the subject of their raillery.
They called him a blustering coward;
and Aurelia, who was obliged to sit at table,
was forced to hear the disgusting language of
her husband in silence, to avoid his ill-treatment.</p>

<p>The Baron's mistresses rallied her relative to
her former lover; and her husband said aloud,</p>

<p>"Suppose I had not let the rascal go?"</p>

<p>"We would have cut off his nose," said one
of the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>"If he does but return&mdash;" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" said Rinaldo, and immediately
entered the room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Altaverde's people had taken
possession of the castle gate, and Sebastiano
had approached nearer. Three more of Rinaldo's
men now joined the other three who

<!-- page 102 -->

stood at the door of the apartment, and six of
Altaverde's followed them.</p>

<p>These twelve men waited for a signal from
Rinaldo, who had alone entered in the apartment,
where his sudden appearance not a little surprised
the company.</p>

<p>"I am come," continued he, "to keep my promise.
You now perceive that I am punctual.
Here I stand and demand satisfaction of you.
From the Baron to the man who proposed to cut
off my nose, I will call every one of you to account."</p>

<p>The Baron now began to laugh aloud, and called
to one of his servants,</p>

<p>"Let my people come and give this Quixotte
the account he asks for!"</p>

<p>The servant scarce began to move, when
Rinaldo seized and threw him down. Then
taking his pistol, pointing it to the table, and
said,</p>

<p>"The first who dares to stir from his seat is a
dead man! Miserable, worthless miscreants!
you that threaten me so freely, tremble and
kneel down before me! Know you who I am?
Down upon you knees! I am Rinaldini!"</p>

<p>Upon this they all knelt down as if thunder-struck.
Aurelia screamed aloud, and sank in a
swoon. Rinaldo obliged the women to assist
her and having given the signal agreed on, his
twelve followers entered the room.</p>

<p>The whole company were still upon their
knees when Rinaldo approached Aurelia, who

<!-- page 103 -->

was beginning to recover. He threw himself
upon his knees, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>"Is it you, rash man," said she, in a broken
voice, "that has rescued me? Oh, be as generous
as you are courageous! Be as kind as
you are terrible! Deal with me honourably,
and conduct me to my mother! Abuse not your
power, nor make my yet unspotted name the
jest of mankind!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Rinaldini, sighing, "now I feel
what I am!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly turning round, he beheld Sebastiano
entering the room with some of his
party, and said,</p>

<p>"As yet this rat-catching expedition has cost
no blood, and it shall end in the same manner.
Flog this villain, who is the husband of this unfortunate
lady, till not one white spot is left.
Drive these Frenchmen and Sicilians two or
three times up and down with rods. The girls I
give you as prizes. But this worthy French
counsellor, who advised cutting off my nose shall
be served in like manner himself."</p>

<p>The Frenchman dreadfully lamented his hard
case but Rinaldini was deaf to his entreaties.
He persisted in his orders, and his comrades took
the delinquents from the apartment.</p>

<p>Rinaldo again approached Aurelia, desired her
to collect together her apparel and jewels, and
ordered a carriage to be prepared; in which he
placed her, together with her waiting woman.
Then mounting his horse, he called out to his
companions,

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>"Plunder the castle, but do not burn it!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo followed the carriage, which he ordered
to stop about a mile from St. Clair's convent
at Montamara. Then riding up to the
coach door, asked for Aurelia's hand, upon a finger
of which he put a ring; and kissing her hand,
said, with emotion,</p>

<p>"Aurelia, may you be happier than I!"</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he clapped spurs to his
horse, and arrived, at break of day, at his tent;
where he was soon joined by his people, who returned
loaded with booty.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was sitting before his tent, and reflecting
on the consequence that might ensue
from this enterprise, when Rosalia approached
him, seated herself near him, and taking her
guitar, though unrequested, sang the following
air:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Hear me, lov'd Almanzor, hear,<br/>

Grant thy Laura's fond request;<br/>

Still to thee is Laura dear?<br/>

Reigns her image in thy breast?</p>

<p>Wilt thou Laura fondly love?<br/>

When her infant climbs thy knee,<br/>

Wilt thou to that infant prove<br/>

Source of endless Infamy?</p>

<p>Sooner would thy Laura fly<br/>

Where thou ne'er shalt know thy child;<br/>

Rather, ah! far rather die<br/>

Graveless in some desert wild,<br/>

Than to thee an offspring bear,<br/>

Stamp'd as shame's dishonoured heir.</p>

</div>

<p>"Ah, Rosalia!" interrupted Rinaldo, "I guess&mdash;yes,
I know who this Laura is! Almanzor
will never desert her."</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p>Rosalia embraced him tenderly, and thus
continued:</p>

<p>"What peace can a mother enjoy, when
contemplating the image of her beloved upon
her lap! when our offspring will be but a
source of misery to us if we do not leave this
course of life. But, by heavens! it shall and
must be; nor will I bring up my son to the
gallows."</p>

<p>The appearance of Sebastiano interrupted
this conversation. He brought intelligence that
two of their people were taken up at St. Leo,
and thrown into prison; and that a third had
escaped. He also brought news, that from information
of the Baron, proclamation had been
made against him.</p>

<p>Toward evening Rinaldo ordered his tent to
be struck; and giving the signal for departure,
stationed himself, after a journey of three days,
in the valley of the Albano mountains.</p>

<p>Two days after his arrival he gave orders to
Sebastiano to go with sixteen resolute fellows,
in various disguises, to Cagli, in the neighbourhood
of Montamara. Altaverde also received
a commission to endeavour to liberate the two
prisoners by address or by force; and Rinaldo
himself as a traveller on horseback, attended
by Nicolo and Alphonso as his servants, rode
about the country upon the scout. Cinthio remained
as captain of the band; and Rinaldo
commended to his care Rosalia, who took
leave of him with tears.</p>

<p>"I feel," said she with emotion, "as though
we should never meet again!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo endeavoured to console her without
success, and left her extremely agitated.</p>

<p>He soon reached Fossombrona; where, having
put up at the principal inn, he rested a
couple of days, desirous of giving Sebastiano's
party time to collect in the neighbourhood of
Montamara.</p>

<p>The day after his arrival he visited a tavern,
where he found several of the inhabitants;
among whom were two advocates and some
notaries, engaged in apparently interesting conversation
over a bottle. Rinaldo called also for
wine; and seating himself near them listened to
their discourse.</p>

<p><i>A Townsman</i>. 'Tis a very bad business.</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. Ah, very bad indeed!</p>

<p><i>Notary</i>. A very shocking affair!</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. The Baroness has twice been
heard. She persists that she previously knew
the person of the aforesaid Count Dalbrogo,
but took him for a man of good character, and
neither knew, nor in the least suspected that
he was the celebrated Rinaldini: and that she
first learnt this with terror and affright when
he avowed himself on the night of these events.
On the other hand, the Baron, who was dreadfully
maltreated, maintains that his wife has
lived in an understanding with this terrible
robber; and that her father is one of his acquaintance,
who has long, contrary to law, been
in treaty to make discovery to the magistracy,

<!-- page 107 -->

to which he is bound. The prince is in custody
at Urbino, and will be closely examined.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. One hardly knows as yet what to
think of it.</p>

<p><i>Notary</i>. The Baron estimates his loss at the
castle at three thousand ducats. He and his
friends were maltreated, and one of the
Frenchmen was mutilated by the robbers. It
is true he still lives, but he is very ill and miserable.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. These robbers are very devils.</p>

<p><i>Notary</i>. I pity the poor prince. He is a
brave man&mdash;but, in confidence, gentlemen, who
among us would dare to seize Rinaldini were he
even now present among us.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. Not I, for one.</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. Yes, yes, a man ought to proceed
cautiously, and first make sure of having assistance.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. Suppose he got loose and I were
to lose my life, who would compensate me for
my zeal? He certainly would not sell his life
cheaply.</p>

<p><i>Notary</i>. I should like to have seen him
once.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Pardon me, gentlemen, but I have
seen him.</p>

<p><i>Notary</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. What?</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. And have you really&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am the Marquis Soligno. My
estates lie in Savoy, and I am on a journey. Six
days ago I fell into the hands of his people, and

<!-- [pages 108 and 109 are missing from the scan of the 1824 edition] -->

<!-- page 108 -->

mine were overpowered. I was expecting
every moment to be plundered, when Rinaldini
himself appeared.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. And what sort of a man is he?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A little fat dark complexioned man,
with blue eyes, brown hair, Roman nose, and
whiskers.</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. Well, I know not what to think of
it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How so?</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. I have been told by others that he is
tall and thin, with a smooth chin, black eyes and
hair, and a Grecian nose. However, I must confess
that a Roman nose is better suited to his
way of life than a Grecian.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have myself seen and spoken to
him, and he is exactly the man I describe. He
searched me very narrowly, and I was obliged
to give him all my ready money and every
thing I had of value. He demanded a hundred
sequins, which I gave him, and in return I had
this letter of protection. See, gentlemen, here
it is.</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. (<i>reading</i>,) Ah, the rascal!</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Viaggio Seguro.*<br/>

Signed, "Rinaldini."</p>

</div>

<p>A man of few words! he is as saving of them
as a minister of state.</p>

<p class="small">[*In lieu of Sicuro, for so Rinaldo wrote, (though not
pure Italian.) I have seen some of these letters.]</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thank God that I came off so well.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. That you may, indeed, Marquis.</p>

<!-- page 109 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But it is unpardonable that the magistracy
do not exert themselves more.</p>

<p><i>Advocate</i>. Only have patience&mdash;I have it from
good authority that five hundred Tuscans and
eight hundred men of the ecclesiastic troops are
going out against him. They are to surround,
and will certainly take him.</p>

<p><i>Townsman</i>. How strong may his band be?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No one can tell. Some talk of two
hundred men; others say he is much stronger;
they are all desperate fellows. Thank heaven I
have got out of their clutches.</p>

<p>Toward evening Rinaldo quitted the place,
and sent out Sebastiano and his people with orders
to take Baron Rovezzo alive or dead, and
if alive, to deliver him to Cinthio. His people
he left in the neighbourhood of Montamara,
and went himself, in the dress of a pilgrim to
Urbino.</p>

<p>Here he learnt that Prince Rocella was indeed
at large, but had been obliged to give securities
to a large amount, and was soon to be
examined. He inquired his address, and had
the boldness one night to enter his chamber.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A pilgrim.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. So I perceive, but what would you
with me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am sent to you on a message from
Rinaldo.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Heavens! What do I hear? You
are himself: now I know you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes, I am he. I know into what

<!-- page 110 -->

embarrassment I have brought you, and am
come to offer you my services.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. What would you do?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With you! Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. I am lost if it be discovered.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fear not; only say how I can serve
you.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Man! What have you done?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If I can serve Aurelia and you with
my life, I will.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Your death cannot extricate us from
this embarrassment. We are accused of an
understanding with you. My child's honour is
lost, and the public opinion is against me. Will
you do me one favour, and then leave me, and
quit the town?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you would justify yourself from
the suspicion of an understanding with me, deliver
me up to justice. I will stay here.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. What advantage would thence arise
to me? Treachery is unworthy a true knight
of Malta.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then I will myself surrender to the
magistrates.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Can that better my condition?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. I know not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I must and will assist you on this
occasion.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. My uncle the cardinal has taken the
business in hand, and I hope the charge against
me will soon be at an end.</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So much the better for your prosecutors.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Rinaldini, would you stop the course
of justice?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Not of justice, but of injustice.
Prince, if I cannot serve <i>you</i>, let me at least do
something for Aurelia&mdash;here are bills for ten
thousand sequins, which I give as her portion in
her new marriage.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. A new marriage!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The Baron must by this time be in
the hands of my party. If he is taken alive
he will be shot, and Aurelia again be free.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Free or not free, she will remain forever
in the convent. Give your money to the
poor, we are none of us in need of it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Adieu.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Oh stay.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What would you?</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. To what end will you come?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. God knows; but I hope a good
one.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. That you can scarcely expect?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As God pleases; good night.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Have you really loved Aurelia?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I love her still.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. She can never be yours; return to
your proper station&mdash;forsake the course of life
you now pursue&mdash;and apply your money to good
works:&mdash;in that dangerous course which you
now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Prince you know I am not easily
frightened; yet my situation is wretched; for,

<!-- page 112 -->

though justice has no torture for me, I have
much within my own bosom. Farewell.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now left the town and returned to
the neighbourhood of Montamara, where his
companions were.</p>

<p>On the following day he received by the
hands of Nero, whom Sebastiano sent to him,
the following written intelligence:</p>

<p>"The cursed Baron is gone to Rome, and
the nest is empty. Our good Altaverde, with
three of his companions, has been trapped at
St. Leo and thrown into prison with our other
unfortunate friends. Cinthio must have had an
engagement with the Tuscan troops. We are
moving toward him. Come to us soon." </p>

<p>Rinaldo despatched Alphonso to Cinthio
with instructions to liberate Altaverde, even
though force were necessary. He also wrote
to Rosalia to join Donato at his hermitage. He
then gave orders to Nicolo and Nero to go to
Rome to watch the motions of the Baron, and
continued a couple of days deliberating what he
should do himself.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>BOOK III.</h3>

</div>

<p>RINALDO at length arrived in a pilgrim's dress
at the convent of Montamara, where Aurelia
was, and desired to speak to the Abbess.</p>

<!-- page 113 -->

<p>"She is engaged," said the portress, "in an
audience before some commissaries, who are
come from Urbino." </p>

<p>"Has any accident then happened to the good
mother," said Rinaldo with a pious sigh.</p>

<p>"She is innocently implicated in a bad affair
with that notorious robber Rinaldini. Besides,
orders are given that till her examination is
over, no stranger be admitted;" thus, saying,
the portress, with a pious courtesy, shut the
door.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now walked round the convent, and
found the walls very high and strong. At length
he laid himself down near a chapel dedicated to
Saint Clair, which stood between three high
poplars; and reflecting on his situation, deliberated
what he should do, till at length he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke he saw another pilgrim sitting
opposite to him, and apparently engaged in
deep thought.</p>

<p>On Rinaldo giving signs of having awoke, the
other pilgrim turned round and said:</p>

<p>"And can you sleep here thus peaceful and
unconcerned?" At this Rinaldo was alarmed;
but endeavouring to recover himself, asked, "Is
this then so dangerous a place?"</p>

<p>"Do you imagine it otherwise?"</p>

<p>"What can a poor pilgrim fear?"</p>

<p>"A poor pilgrim has nothing to fear, nor indeed
he who covers his misdeeds with a pilgrim's dress."</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>Upon this Rinaldo sprang up, fixed his eyes
on the other pilgrim, and cried out, "Cinthio!"</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Ha! do you know me at last.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How came you here?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Not of my own free will.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What has happened?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. We are entirely cut to pieces.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. It is a fact. Surrounded on three
sides we fought like desperadoes, and cut down
many a brave fellow, but were so hemmed in,
that scarcely half a dozen of us escaped.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. For heaven's sake where is Rosalia?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I know not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is Altaverde rescued?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I know not where he is.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Did you not receive my letter by
Alphonso?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I have not seen him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I sent him to you three days ago?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. At that time we were already dispersed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Altaverde with several of our friends
are in prison at St. Leo.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then he must seriously think of his
last hour, for we cannot save him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Cinthio, what is to be done?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Fly as far as possible. Are more of
our party near?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Nero and Nicolo are gone to Rome.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Have they any fixed place appointed
for them?</p>

<!-- page 115 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Are you going to Rome yourself?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps I am.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then tell me where I can find you.
We will go to Calabria.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What would you do there?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I will collect a new company. Here
there is nothing more for us to do; and in the
woods and mountains of Calabria we shall be
safer.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And if you are again driven from
thence?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then we will go to Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, Cinthio! were it not better to
forsake this course of life?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Not till it pleases Fortune to put an
end to it.&mdash;You yourself will only continue till
the police catches you, and then adieu to Rinaldini's
head; Cinthio will stand in your shoes,
keep whole countries in alarm, and throw their
police into confusion.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A most enviable lot.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Do you know a better? To us an
impassable bar shuts up every other course.
That we are now pursuing&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is the worst of all.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then we ought not to have entered
upon it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah, Rosalia!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Your amours have done us no good.
They have already brought us into many difficulties,
and will at length cost you your head.
If any one saw you wandering about among

<!-- page 116 -->

chapels and cloisters, he would rather take you
for a beggar than a man of courage. Tell me
where I can find our friends; for I will go to
Rome; and if you should wish to travel through
Calabria, I will give you a letter of protection.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Go to Rome if you please; I shall
continue a while in this neighbourhood. If I
meet with any of our friends, I will send them
to you. I will soon follow you into Calabria.</p>

<p>Cinthio now left him, and Rinaldo went to
Corinaldo. Here he unexpectedly fell in with
three of his company, whom he immediately
send forward after Cinthio. One of them was
of opinion Rosalia had taken flight among the
mountains, and would soon appear, but he could
give him no certain information.</p>

<p>He himself hesitated some time, totally unresolved
what to do.</p>

<p>Seeing a crowd of people, he inquired what
was the matter, and learnt that a suspicious
person was about to be whipt out of the town
with rods. This information he listened to
with indifference, and was going to the pilgrim's
inn, but soon perceived all the streets to be full:
and as he attempted to crowd through a small
square, which was full of people, he met the
executioner's procession.</p>

<p>He involuntarily turned his eyes toward the
unfortunate victim, and beheld the amazon
Florilla, who had once belonged to his band.</p>

<p>She cast her eyes toward him, recognized
him, and with a voice of grief cried aloud,
"Oh, Rinaldini!"</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>On this involuntary exclamation, a confused
outcry arose of "Rinaldini! where is he? hold
him fast."</p>

<p>All was now in commotion; every one was
crying out or asking questions, or calling for the
guards. The police officers broke through the
crowd with drawn sabres, and pressed toward
the place were Rinaldini actually stood, who
perceiving he was in the greatest danger of
being instantly taken up as an unknown stranger,
and that he could only save himself by
some sudden expedient, seized a fellow who
stood near him, and thrusting him toward the
police officers, cried, "Hold him fast! 'tis he!
'tis he!"</p>

<p>The officers of justice instantly surrounded
their prisoner, and the people crowded about
them, exclaiming with triumph, "Rinaldini!
Rinaldini!"</p>

<p>Thus they halloed and screamed, so that
the poor fellow could not say a word: till at
length observing him more narrowly, they perceived
he was a butcher well known throughout
the town.</p>

<p>"Are you in your senses?" asked he in a
trembling voice; "do you not know me? am I
Rinaldini, or am I not?"</p>

<p>They now burst into a loud laugh; and beginning
to be very riotous, cried out, " 'Tis Giacomo
the butcher!"</p>

<p>The police-officers were enraged, and cried
out, "Here is some deception: search the whole
town: Rinaldini is somewhere among us."</p>

<!-- page 118 -->

<p>"Search the town," was now the universal
cry, while the crowd broke the executioner's procession
into disorder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldini had entered a church,
and having left his pilgrim's dress near a confessional
and put on a false nose, quitted the
place in the dress of a peasant, which he wore
underneath.</p>

<p>He proceeded without stopping through Paterno;
and, notwithstanding his hunger and fatigue,
pursued his way to Torette, near which,
seeing a small house and two girls knitting at
the door, he approached them, saying:</p>

<p>"Can I take up my lodgings with you till early
to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"With us!" repeated the girls with surprise.</p>

<p>"Aye with you, if you have no objection."</p>

<p>"Surely you know not that you are come to a
Jew's house."</p>

<p>"Well! what signifies that?"</p>

<p>"People of your religion always shun our
dwellings."</p>

<p>"In that they do ill. I am very tired; do not
oblige me to travel farther, but receive me into
your house."</p>

<p>The girls seemed confused, and looked at
each other; but at length one of them replied,
"We are alone at present; our father is gone to
Ancona."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of me?" said Rinaldini.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," replied she, "but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to propriety be not uneasy; who should
know that I am here? beside it gives me a

<!-- page 119 -->

particular pleasure to be received into such a
house as yours."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I will buy of you if you have any thing to
sell that I want. I am not what I appear, and
have plenty of money."</p>

<p>"Well, we will venture upon it; come in and
take us as you find us."</p>

<p>Thus saying, they conducted him into a small
room, where they set before him bread and
cheese, wine, figs and other fruit. Rinaldo
pressed the young women to drink with him
and having emptied a couple of bottles he thus
addressed them:</p>

<p>"You seem to be two kind and worthy girls,
and I am concerned to perceive that you are
poor. I will make you a present and better
your circumstances. I am a noble Venitian
who have had an affair of honour with a rival,
whom I had the misfortune to kill in a duel,
and fled in this disguise in hopes of avoiding
pursuit."</p>

<p>As he said this he pulled off his false nose,
"which made the girls laugh; he then asked
them if they had any clothes to sell.</p>

<p>"We have a couple of suits in the house,"
said Rachel, who was the elder of the two sisters.</p>

<p>"The rest," added Silpa, "my father has
taken with him."</p>

<p>"Show me what you have," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Upon this they brought out their stock of
clothes, among which was a uniform tolerably

<!-- page 120 -->

handsome. This Rinaldo chose, and then they
sat down again to table and emptied another
bottle of wine.</p>

<p>When the day began to dawn, Rinaldo, having
taken a light breakfast, dressed himself in
his uniform.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. Truly now we can easily perceive you
are a Cavalier.</p>

<p><i>Silpa</i>. It fits you exactly.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. Indeed you look much better than you
did yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Silpa</i>. Quite grand.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. And by heavens you have a couple of
very pretty watches.</p>

<p><i>Silpa</i>. And very handsome rings.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. You must be a very rich man.</p>

<p><i>Silpa</i>. Who gave you these treasures?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. These peasant's clothes I give to
you. Here is a bill of one hundred sequins,
payable at Ancona, for my night's lodging; and
for your entertainment and the uniform, take
these five and twenty sequins in ready money:
are you satisfied?</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. Oh, you are too generous, we shall
not spend so much in a twelve month.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Adieu my good girls! think of me
when I am gone.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i>. That we will.</p>

<p><i>Silpa</i>. We shall never forget your kindness.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Heaven protect you!</p>

<p>Upon this he left his quarters, and shunning
Ancona, went to Poggia, where he bought a
horse and immediately hastened to the frontiers

<!-- page 121 -->

of the ecclesiastical states. Teramo, a place
in the dominion of the king of Naples, was the
first where he stopped and took up his abode.</p>

<p>Having provided himself with clothes at
Aquila, he there hired a brisk lad named Antonio:
and pursuing his travels as Count Mandochini,
arrived at Naples.</p>

<p>In this magnificent city he took handsome
apartments, where he was lodged with worthy
people, and had a prospect of the harbour.</p>

<p>Here he lived very quietly, read a great deal,
thought more, wrote verses, composed songs,
and sang them to the guitar.</p>

<p>After a time, however, he began to be surprised
at this uniform mode of life, which induced
him to spend more of his time abroad,
and to visit taverns and coffee-houses, where
he heard the talk of the day. Sometimes he
himself was the subject of conversation, and
upon these occasions he joined in it with perfect
confidence. Once a stranger brought news
that Rinaldini was taken up at Ferrara and
thrown into prison. Thus he heard them talk
of him with more pleasure, and felt more secure
in his present abode.</p>

<p>Among the various persons he daily saw at
public places, he one day observed a man who
wore a Corsican uniform and was called Captain.
This man often sat a whole morning taking
a dish of chocolate without speaking a word,
except thanking those who saluted him, but
never took the smallest part in any conversation
except by a nod: and whoever he met,

<!-- page 122 -->

always looked straight forward, being apparently
lost in the profoundest reflection. He was
remarked by every one, but seemed to observe
no one.</p>

<p>Rinaldo one day approached him with at
much caution as possible, but could not succeed
in inducing him to speak. One day, however,
he sat closer to him than usual.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "excuse me making one
remark."</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Upon me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Upon you: every one observes
you.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. That is possible.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps you wish it?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. It never occurred to my thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps some secret cause of affliction
preys upon your mind?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. If so I know nothing of it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Or, perhaps, some embarrassment
makes you silent?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am not embarrassed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Cares, perhaps, oppress you?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I have no cares.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You go into company and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am always alone, even in the largest
company.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is very bad.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. What can be better?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Communication renders men happy.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Not always.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Conversation secures us against

<p><i>Captain</i>. With that I am unacquainted.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you are very enviable, and
must be a great philosopher.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Any one that will, may be philosopher;
and happy he, who is!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your last assertion I believe, but not
the first.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. That depends on you. In matters
of belief men are not so very accurate, and the
more they deceive themselves the happier they
are.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Self-deception is a dream.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. It is well for those who dream happily.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And when they awake&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. They wish even for their dream's
sake to dream again.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And thus the disappointment of their
wish renders them unhappy.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. It depends on every man to be happy
or otherwise. Every man is happy who
seriously resolves to be so.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you so?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you are a most enviable mortal.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. So I think.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But as every man has his own ideas
of happiness, so&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. So you wish to know what are
mine!&mdash;they are somewhat out of the circle of
this world.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I understand you not.</p>

<!-- page 124 -->

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am convinced of it&mdash;in general
men understand one another very ill, and these
misunderstandings help to make out conversation
in society, which would otherwise be as
uniform and tedious as a choir of Carthusian
monks. The best communication is between
souls and spirits.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you acquainted then with the
world of spirits?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. As well as I know you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Know me? I do not even know
myself.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Oh, yes, in one respect, at least,
certainly.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you know then who I am?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Yes, I say I do know you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yet I never saw you till I came to
Naples.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I know it; I also first saw you here;
nevertheless I know you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you are a sorcerer; who told
you who I am?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. My wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you can see what is secret.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. And why not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You converse then with spirits?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am now conversing with a man
who, I hope, has reformed himself.</p>

<p>As he said this he arose, paid his small account,
and went; but Rinaldo had not the courage
to follow him.</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>It may easily be imagined Rinaldo was not a
little embarrassed, and though he had so long
wished to become acquainted with this singular
character, he now regretted he had ever spoken
to him. Thus do men continually pant for the
accomplishment of objects which often make
more painful discoveries than they conceived
were possible.</p>

<p>This man, said Rinaldo to himself, knows
who I am: the discovery of my name is in the
power of this singular being. Who can this
strange mortal be, who does not consider human
society as having any thing in common
with him? Ah, he shall come to an explanation
with me, or I will annihilate this enemy to my
repose.</p>

<p>Rinaldo frequented the Curso and other
public places for several days in search of this
dreadful sage, and often returned to the coffee-house
where he had daily seen him, but without
success, which gave him no small uneasiness.</p>

<p>He was already deliberating whether he
should quit Naples, when one morning he met
with his redoubted Corsican at the Promenade
on the harbour. He was sitting on a seat
placed before a statue, against the pedestal of
which he leaned, with his eyes turned toward
heaven, and his hands lying folded together as
though he was pouring forth his whole soul in
a prayer to the Almighty.</p>

<p>Rinaldo placed himself opposite to him, but
ventured not to disturb the celestial ecstasy.
After a while he began from time to time to

<!-- page 126 -->

cough, and at last to hum the air of a melody
then much admired. The captain, however,
did not stir, but appeared wholly lost in a divine
reverie.</p>

<p>At length, tired of waiting, Rinaldo, with
trembling steps, walked up to him, placed himself
at his side, and laying his hand on his
shoulder, said with a half sigh of suppressed
emotion:</p>

<p>"Captain, I rejoice to see you again."</p>

<p>The captain cast his eyes downward, turned
his head, beheld the person who saluted him,
and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you see above you?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A pure blue ether.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. The picture of an unspotted soul.
The emblem of a pure spirit. This &aelig;thereal
essence pours through the eyes into the heart.
This is the centre of every true enjoyment that
exists within us, or without us. There we
make them our own; it is a present to us from
heaven.&mdash;What are the gaudiest flowers to
this azure sea of brilliant purity? He that casts
his anchor there is moored in the safest of
harbours.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your reflections are both grand and
beautiful, and I ought to reproach myself for
having interrupted you in such elevated thoughts.
But pardon the impatience I felt to speak with
you.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Your confusion is greater than your
impatience; confess only that you fear me. You
have nothing to fear, I am no inquisitor, no custom-house

<!-- page 127 -->

inspector, nor criminal judge, yet
those are the people you have to fear.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Have you not mistaken me for
some other person?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then tell me my name.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. It costs money.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. To every police. It might be sold
like a jewel were a man in want.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Captain, language there is which
becomes an insult when meant seriously.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I know it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In one word then, who am I?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. In one word, you are Rinaldini.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who told you so?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I know it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you certain?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. As certain as of my own existence.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Adieu!</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To the harbour, to see if any ship
is ready to sail and will take me on board.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Why would you leave Naples, and
fly from the tranquillity that here surrounds
you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Because I fear you.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. When a man like you fears, there
must be some cause for fear. Your fate interests
me, and I will give you a proof of it, which
will make you perfectly secure. But let me
not find you again in your old career, or your
friend will be changed to an enemy.</p>

<!-- page 128 -->

<p>The sound of trumpets now sounded the
approach of the troops who were on guard at
the castle and in the port, which broke off
their conversation. The whole company of
officers appeared and gathered round Rinaldo
and the Captain, having met them in public
company before; the officers saluted them and
entered into conversation, in which Rinaldo
joined with a beating heart. They asked the
Captain various questions, and at length an inquisitive
young lieutenant said to him,</p>

<p>"Do you know, Captain, that in all companies
every one is puzzling his wits about
you; you are the chief talk of the day."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the Captain, "I will tell you
a much more important piece of intelligence.
You are puzzling yourselves in vain about me.
Do you know that the famous Rinaldini is
among you here in Naples."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was thunderstruck; the officers looked
at each other with astonishment, and a
general silence prevailed throughout the company.</p>

<p>The Captain took out his snuff box, offered
every one a pinch, and turning round as he put
it in his pocket, walked toward the port; no
one, however, detained him, but they all kept
their eyes upon him, and asked one another,
"Who can this man be?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo now recovered breath, and as soon
as the Captain was out of sight, said:</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, gentlemen? Has

<!-- page 129 -->

not this singular man, whom no one knows,
clearly given us to understand who he is?"</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" they all exclaimed, "He
himself is Rinaldini."</p>

<p>"That too is my opinion," replied Rinaldini,
with perfect indifference.</p>

<p>"He is gone," said one, and another proposed
to pursue him; but an old Colonel addressed
them thus:</p>

<p>"We are no sbirri.* It is the business of
the magistrates to secure the person of Rinaldini;
and even if this unknown stranger is
really he, he must know how far he can venture
to discover himself without sacrificing his
security! meanwhile we will keep a watchful
eye upon him. Yet I must frankly confess,
that his conduct, as far as I have hitherto observed,
appears to me not altogether to agree
with that of a man in his perfect senses; and
perhaps it is an effect of his madness, to imagine
himself to be the dreaded robber; are
there not similar instances of disturbed imagination?
We must also be cautious, and I recommend
to you, gentlemen, to keep silence on
this affair. We will first observe this stranger
more narrowly, and then determine how we
will act toward him."</p>

<p class="small">[*Police Officers.]</p>

<p>This speech met with general approbation,
and the company adjourned to a coffee-house to
take ices.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was now in a state of great uneasiness,
and knew not what to do, nor could

<!-- page 130 -->

he form any opinion as to this man, who seemed
so ready to sacrifice him, whose conduct
was so unaccountable, and whose warning still
echoed in his ears.</p>

<p>He sought for him, however, every where
in vain, for he had totally vanished from
Naples. His discovery now was the general
topic of conversation, and came to be more particularly
investigated. The officers gave a deposition
of what they had seen and heard, and
the police sent out runners in search of him.
Yet all these exertions were in vain. The
report was now converted into a certainty, that
this singular man was Rinaldini; every one told
anecdotes of him, or rejoiced that he had seen
him; while the true Rinaldini escaped all suspicion.
Such is indeed the common course of
human affairs. We talk of that as at a distance
which is close to us, run after phantoms, and
neglect what really exists.</p>

<p>At length the public attention was directed
to other objects, which put an end to the reports
of the appearance of Rinaldini, who was
now thought of no more.</p>

<p>One evening, about a month after this incident,
as Rinaldo was sitting in his chamber,
playing on his guitar, and composing a new
song, the door opened and a beautiful girl entered,
saying:</p>

<p>"Do I find Count Mandochini here?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am he.</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. I have a letter to deliver to you; it
comes from the hands of a beautiful woman.</p>

<!-- page 131 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Most surely; for I receive it from
yours.</p>

<p>It was as follows:</p>

<p class="small">"As little as you seem to have observed one
in whom you have excited a lively interest, so
much has she observed you. If you are not indifferent
to seeing her, inform the bearer of
these lines where you can meet her."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you know the lady?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. I am in her service.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who is she?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. A lady of quality.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you very serious?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. Most certainly; her name cannot interest
you until she interests you herself. She
will then tell it you, and it will sound more
pleasing in your ear than if I were to name
her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And yet you have a very pleasing
voice.</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. My parents have brought me up to be a
singer.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Aha! but your mistress, am I to
call her mistress or miss?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. As you please. I am not to tell you
whether she is married or unmarried.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She is pretty you say?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. It depends on your taste whether you
think her pretty or not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She is a woman of quality?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. If you married her you would not degrade
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she rich?</p>

<!-- page 132 -->

<p><i>Girl</i>. You are doubtless rich yourself, since
you make that inquiry. But why all these
ceremonies. Will you see her or not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where can I see her?</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. To-morrow morning at mass, at San
Lorenzo.&mdash;She will be dressed in a green gown
and black veil, with a gold chain round her
waist, and a nosegay of orange flowers at her
bosom. Will you come?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will.</p>

<p>The girl now departed; but Rinaldo was
not long left to his reflections before the door
again opened, and a man wrapt up in a red
cloak entered.</p>

<p>"Rinaldo," said he, "the message you have
received is of no avail. You must not go to-morrow
to San Lorenzo to meet the lady who
is so desirous of seeing you."</p>

<p>"Let me know," said Rinaldo, "who you
are, if you mean I should follow your advice."</p>

<p>Upon this the stranger took off a mask, and
opening his cloak, Rinaldo recognized the Corsican
Captain. He started back with surprise
and was about to speak, when the captain thus
addressed him,</p>

<p>"May you not safely follow the advice of a
man who has sacrificed himself for you, and
procured you the security and repose you enjoy
at Naples?"</p>

<p>Having thus spoken he left the room.</p>

<p>Rinaldo lay awake half the night and awoke
earlier than usual, but did not keep his appointment
at San Lorenzo.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>At the approach of evening the girl returned
and said,</p>

<p>"You have broken your word. Why did you
not come?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am mistrustful.</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. Your mistrust is very ill-placed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will not come till I know the name
of the lady I am to meet.</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>. Do not give yourself cause to regret that
which others would so eagerly pant for. You
have only to see her. If she pleases you, she will
herself tell you her name. To-morrow she will
herself be at mass. Good night.</p>

<p>Soon after the girl was gone, the Captain
again appeared.</p>

<p>"You must not go to San Lorenzo," said he.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My worthy friend, I am not a child
to follow you blindfold. If you would influence
my conduct you must assign reasons.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. For that I cannot blame you, but
you must rely upon my word, and not form with
a stranger an acquaintance which will be of no
avail.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As yet you are yourself unknown to
me.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. But you shall know me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. At Portici. But to San Lorenzo you
must not go.</p>

<p>Thus saying the Captain departed. Rinaldo
remained in profound reflection. When morning
came he was still unresolved. At length,

<!-- page 134 -->

though sometimes inclined to keep his appointment,
he determined to break it.</p>

<p>In the evening the beautiful messenger again
returned, and silently courtesying, delivered him
a letter to the following effect:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"For the last time I ask a favour of you which
you cannot refuse me, if you are a Cavalier and
possess the least principle of politeness.</p>

<p>"AURELIA."</p>

</div>

<p>When Rinaldo observed this signature, he
save the girl three sequins, and half beside
himself exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Tell the lady that I will come as surely as I
exist. No envious fury shall prevent my keeping
this appointment, even should I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," cried the Captain, "none of these
oaths, which you will never perform!"</p>

<p>"I will perform them."</p>

<p>"Be tranquil."</p>

<p>"No power in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The police are not without runners."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was now alarmed, and looked for the
girl but perceived she had quitted the room. He
then threw himself into a chair.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. You are always proud and intractable,
but remember that you no longer command,
and must therefore obey.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who gave you power to command
me?</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Who obliges me to save you at my
own peril?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That obligation is imposed on you by
yourself.</p>

<!-- page 135 -->

<p><i>Captain</i>. Ungrateful man! will you quarrel
with your friend for so precarious a possession
as a woman, and offend him to embrace a shadow?
Besides, what can you expect from
her? be it ever so exquisite 'tis but love. In
us women but love themselves; we are their
looking-glass, in which they admire their own
reflection.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are a woman hater.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. But I am your friend.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you would not keep me from
speaking to them.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. You are your own master, but I absolutely
forbid it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you wish for my compliance, assign
some reason.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. I am no prophet; but the consequences
will justify me. I see further than you.
My power&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your power! Give me a proof
of it.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. That you shall have; rise and follow
me to Portici.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Give me the proof here.</p>

<p><i>Captain</i>. Art thou, the once courageous
hero of the night, become a timid boy? Go
break your sabre and take a wooden sword.
I see through you. Now I permit you to see
this woman. Learn to know her, and then also
to know me. Adieu.</p>

<p>Rinaldo passed a very uneasy night, and hastened
in the morning, at the appointed hour, to
San Lorenzo; but did not meet Aurelia. At

<!-- page 136 -->

length, however, he perceived her messenger,
who giving him a wink, he followed her, and
having quitted the church, she said, "My mistress
desired me to make her excuses. It was
impossible for her to keep her appointment to-day;
but she requests you will follow me. I
will conduct you to her."</p>

<p>Rinaldo, without farther reflection followed
her out of town, to a charming spot, where an
elegant house stood in the middle of a garden.
On entering she conducted him through a beautiful
hall on the ground floor, to a chamber,
where all the jalousies were down. Through
this pleasing obscurity she conducted him to a
smaller apartment, which was still more obscure.
"Here," said the girl, as she showed
him in, "you will find the lady." He immediately
perceived a female figure on a sofa,
whom he approached, and throwing himself on
his knees, seized her hand, which he covered
with kisses, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Oh, Aurelia, what a happy moment!"</p>

<p>"Happy?&mdash;truly happy," replied a soft female
voice.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Happier than I ever hoped to be.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. And yet you were so irresolute.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I knew not that it was Aurelia.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. How!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She whose image I shall eternally
bear in my heart.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Count, you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Thus are the most ambitious of my
hopes unexpectedly realized.</p>

<!-- page 137 -->

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. And have you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh Aurelia, My life!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I fear&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What can she fear whom I adore.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. That which I have reason to fear.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what is that?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. That some misunderstanding has
deceived you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. You speak to me as though we were
old acquaintance, and to my knowledge&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That voice&mdash;By Heavens&mdash;no, you
are not Aurelia.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I am Aurelia, but cannot be the Aurelia
you mean.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes, my imagination has indeed deceived
me. You are not Aurelia Rovezzo.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Alas! I am not. Ah! good Count,
how much I wish I were. I have seen you and
observed you. Alas! with too much pleasure;
and now I fear my admiration is turned to love.
Now I am compelled to wish I had never beheld
you. O leave me to the torment you have
caused, and pay your homage to your beloved
Aurelia?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And shall this obscurity which surrounds
us, never give place to day-light?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Of what importance can it be to
you to see the face of a woman to whom you
are so indifferent? continue for my sake to be
a friend to a stranger who now desires to be so
forever. Your Aurelia&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah! I shall never see her more.</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. No!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How could my imagination so widely
deceive me? My Aurelia languished in a convent,
and I have no claim upon her affections.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. I compassionate you&mdash;but let us put
an end to this interview. We have both enjoyed
a pleasing dream: at the moment of our
separation we shall awake: the remembrance,
however, will be left us.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If the dream is past, let us change it
to reality. Permit me to behold the face from
which such charming words proceed. The
sound of your harmonious voice&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. If it be really so, it may compensate
your stay. None but a lover shall see my face.
Spare me the shame which the step I have
causes, and now enough of our adventure.
Adieu, Count.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are very cruel.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Of that you at least have no right to
complain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Permit me for once to behold your
beauteous eyes.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. You have no claim to see them.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, charming stranger! The celestial
harmony of your voice roots me to the
ground. Do as you please, but I cannot quit
this spot.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Be not indiscreet.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I cannot go&mdash;I know not what thus
overpowers me.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Curiosity.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, no.</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Caprice.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, 'tis more powerful than either;
I cannot but pay my homage to this beauteous
stranger.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. With a divided heart.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I love Aurelia Rovezzo as my sister,
but shall never possess her!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. And do you, therefore, reckon on possessing
me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now I am able to go.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Then go.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have formed a bad opinion of
me.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. That I will not say: but how will
your continuing here benefit either of us?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What harm can arise from my paying
you my homage?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Oh, Count, I am not so vain as you
perhaps imagine. This imprudent step&mdash;but I
have already confessed to you my motives.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you entirely free?</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. As yet I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So am I.</p>

<p>Here a pause ensued: after which Rinaldo
kissed the hand of his fair incognita, and gently
pressed it, felt hers gently pressing his. Aurelia
sighed; and her sigh was repeated by Rinaldo.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How happy might we be, both equally
free and unrestrained!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Count, I beg of you to leave me.
You have brought me into a situation in which
I ought not to be.</p>

<p>At length, however, the door opened. The
lovers started, and looking up beheld the Corsican
Captain.</p>

<p>"I can have no doubt," said he, "of what has
passed, and I wish it may only give two persons
cause of repentance."</p>

<p>The lady covered her face with her hands,
when the Captain turning toward her, quietly
took them away, and said, "You have torn yourself
from me and given yourself up to this man;
may he feel all the good and evil of being beloved
by you! I renounce you, and demand nothing
back but the ring I gave you as the pledge of my
fidelity.</p>

<p>Upon this she silently took the ring from her
finger and returned it. As the Captain received
it, he added, "This house and garden you will
this day leave;" then quitting the apartment, he
shut the door.</p>

<p>"How shall I understand all this?" said Rinaldo
with embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I will explain it," said she, "when we meet
again."</p>

<p>"When and where will that be?"</p>

<p>"My maid will come for you as soon as I can
see you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now arose to depart, when Aurelia
fell upon his neck, kissed him with ardour, and
taking her ring from her finger, which she put on
his,</p>

<p>"I call this ring," said she, "as I now may
you, mine."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh you know not, nor can you imagine,

<!-- page 141 -->

how dear this happy moment may perhaps
cost me!</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. It has no price. I have given it you.
The Corsican will not fight you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is not what I fear.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. What then can you fear?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He is master of my most important
secret.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Fear nothing, he is no traitor. I
have been false to him, and yet fear nothing
from him. Had he acted to me as I have to
him, I would infallibly have plunged a dagger
in his heart. I love without bounds, but if I
am betrayed, blood must flow as sure as I exist.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are a most dangerous person.</p>

<p><i>Aurelia</i>. Not to you, if you love me. To him
who is the object of my choice I shall ever be
faithful. The Captain I never chose or loved.
Fortune alone united me to him, and I have at
length found an opportunity of breaking my
chains. But you I love, and give myself up to
you entirely. Oh, love me as I love you, so
shall we both be extremely happy.</p>

<p>Rinaldo at length departed and returned
home like one in a dream. He now feared a
visit from the Captain, but received none.
Three days passed, yet he neither saw the
Captain nor heard from his beloved inamorata.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, as he walked with pensive
step beside the harbour, some cannon announced
the arrival of a ship, whose boat presently
put off and landed passengers. Rinaldo
walked toward the strangers and the sailors

<!-- page 142 -->

and porters who accompanied them, when he
was suddenly seized from behind, and on turning
round, Rosalia, in man's clothes, threw herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>Surprise and terror made Rinaldo silent;
but Rosalia burst into tears and exclaimed,
"God be thanked! I have at last found you!"</p>

<p>To avoid observation Rinaldo returned home,
whither the two boxes Rosalia had brought
were carried also.</p>

<p>Rinaldo sent his servant out, shut the door,
and when Rosalia had recovered herself, she related
to him the following incidents:</p>

<p>"On that dreadful day when we were surrounded
on all sides, I had the good fortune to
escape. I fled to the mountains and came at
length to Avezzo, where a worthy old woman
received me. Grief and fear now affected me
so deeply, that I was taken ill and miscarried.
The strength of my constitution, however,
overcame my illness; and as soon as I recovered
I went to Leghorn, where I took ship for
Naples, where I had a strong hope I should find
you. Thanks to the Holy Virgin, I have succeeded.
In these boxes I have brought as
much of your buried treasures as I could find in
the Appenine mountains, and I rejoice heartily
that I am enabled to restore them to their
owner."</p>

<p>Rinaldo tenderly embraced her, thanked her
for her fidelity, and instantly resolved to quit Naples
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Now my dear girl, I am both rich and happy,"

<!-- page 143 -->

exclaimed he aloud; "and so shall you be
also."</p>

<p>Fatigued with her voyage, Rosalia had lain
down to repose, when the beautiful girl from
Rinaldo's fair inamorata entered with the following
letter:</p>

<p class="small">"She who sincerely loves you&mdash;she whom
you must no longer call Aurelia, but your own
tender Olympia, wishes to enjoy the happiness
of seeing you at her house; the girl will conduct
you to her."</p>

<p>Rinaldo reflected a moment, and at length resolved
to accompany the girl in order to avoid
giving his tender signora, whose revengeful spirit
he well knew, the smallest suspicion.</p>

<p>As I am about to quit Naples so soon, said he
to himself, I may at least see her once more, as
it will probably be the last time.</p>

<p>Thus he accompanied the messenger of love
to a beautiful house scarcely a hundred paces
from his own residence: she received him in
the most ardent manner, but Rinaldo assumed
a considerable degree of coldness.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Is it thus you return my passion?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is four days since I have had the
pleasure of seeing the beauteous Olympia.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. To me they have seemed an
eternity.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh, speak not thus; I might never
have seen you more.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And why not?</p>

<p>Olympia, You shall hear&mdash;from this time

<!-- page 144 -->

there is not an hour of my life but I devote to
you. Ungrateful man, if you did but know
what I have done!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. May I know it?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What do you imagine?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Nothing; and therefore I would
know what it is I have done which you estimate
so high. My Olympia will also pardon me if&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Not a word more. This coldness
is misplaced, where love and happiness expect
you. I can bear a man's ill-humour if I love
him as I love you; but this coldness I cannot
bear; I know not what claims I have on you,
and I must confess the manner in which you
now speak to me offends me. Now defend
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I wait first for Olympia's defence.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Mine shall immediately follow hers.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. How artful!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Four whole days!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Speak not of days, when love is our
only concern, nor tax my feeling by the striking
of the clock.&mdash;That which endures for ever
cannot be counted by measures of time&mdash;I insist
on hearing your defence.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And I on yours; for my right and
the offence I have received are of longer date.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Are you really offended?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If I were not I must be indifferent
to you.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Will you not permit me to conceal
my secret?</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Have you no secrets from me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That question shall be answered at a
future time.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Just so shall my question be resolved.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This concealment increases my suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What suspicion can you harbour?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Those which a lover harbours from
whose sight his beloved has hid herself for
some moments&mdash;I talk not of four whole days.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. 'Tis connected with another history
and must be concealed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now then I am satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh! why that bitter laugh? Alas,
I understand you too well!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am glad of it.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Do not provoke me to extremes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What would you do?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. For you I have&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Was all you have done of your own
free will or not?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Alas! it was. But you know what
I have sacrificed to this passion.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If it can be compensated by gold&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Ah, wretch that I am! I love you,
and you would pay me with gold! Take from
me all I have, make me as poor as a beggar, I
will follow you barefoot:&mdash;and were you yourself
to become poor, I would steal for you.&mdash;Yes,
for you I would be carried to the scaffold
and rejoice that I and not you were to be the

<!-- page 146 -->

victim! If you talk thus you must measure my
passion by your own sordid standard.</p>

<p>As she said this she threw herself with vehement
emotion upon a sofa; and Rinaldo silently
paced to and fro across the chamber.</p>

<p>Olympia's maid now came in, and having set
out the table with a cold collation and some fruit
and wine, left the room.</p>

<p>After a long pause Olympia asked, "Will
your lordship please to eat?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied Rinaldo. Upon
this, without speaking another word, chairs
were placed, and they sat down and ate. Olympia
then filled a glass, and taking it in her hand
said in a tender tone, "To our reconciliation!"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If Olympia will confess herself in
the wrong, and that she has unjustly offended
me by what she last said?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I will do every thing you wish&mdash;I
love you so very dearly&mdash;Be it so. Now not a
word further on that subject.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But the four days must be first explained.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I could not till to-day receive you
decently.&mdash;On the very day when I parted from
you so happy, I quitted the house which the
Captain had taken from me, spent my time in
a miserable habitation, and was not settled in
this apartment till to-day.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The place where thou wast present
would have been the temple of love; why was I
not admitted there?</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I was ashamed to receive you in an
apartment and part of the town&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where you were yourself? if you
were in want of any thing, why did you not&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Of that not a word.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Did you live at the expense of the
Captain or not?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. In some measure.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are not a Neapolitan?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I am a Genoese of a noble birth!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And yet live here?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Had you heard my history you would
know the cause.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will hear it now.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. As soon as you have rendered yourself
worthy of my confidence.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you know of the Captain?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That he is a singular mysterious
man, full of secrets, and priding himself on his
great wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And have you no proof that he
really possesses it?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Some.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What are they?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I am afraid to discover them to
you.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was about to reply, when a man who
was muffled up came without ceremony into the
room, walked up to him, and delivered him a
letter. Olympia beheld this silent personage
with an eye of suspense, while he took from the

<!-- page 148 -->

table a glass of wine, which he drank and then
silently quitted the room.</p>

<p>Rinaldini opened the letter, which contained
these words:</p>

<p class="small">"Rinaldini is in danger."</p>

<p>Then tore the paper in small pieces, and
sprang up from the table.</p>

<p>"In God's name, Count," said Olympia, in
the utmost anxiety, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo took his sword, kissed her hand, and
said, "To-morrow, my dear Olympia, you shall
see me again;" and then hurried to the door.
Upon which Olympia sprang up, embraced him,
and begged him to stay; but he kissed her with
ardour, and said in a tender voice, "be calm,
we shall meet again to-morrow." He then tore
himself away, quitted the room, ran down stairs
and hastened home, where he had scarcely
arrived before the same person who had just
delivered him the letter entered. They looked
at each other a considerable time without
speaking, till at length Rinaldo broke silence
and said,</p>

<p>"Captain, I understand your hint."</p>

<p>"What the devil!" said the other, "I never
have been captain yet. But we have known
each other when you were captain." Thus
saying he took off a mask, and discovered himself
to be his old companion Ludovico.</p>

<p>Rinaldo pressed his hand and said,</p>

<p>"Whence came you, my brave youth?"</p>

<p>"That I will tell you," replied the other;

<!-- page 149 -->

"but first give me something to drink, for I am
extremely thirsty."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now brought out some bottles of
wine, and Ludovico related the following incidents:</p>

<p>"The last time we were attacked, when you
were not with us, the artillery played upon us
more heavily than it ever had before; and a
terrible slaughter was the consequence. I came
by circuitous paths from one town to another as
secretly as possible, till I arrived here, when I
found a relation, whom justice has in like manner
driven from place to place, and who has introduced
me to a set of fellows, that would steal
the devil's nose from his face if he had one.
They are mutually bound to each other, and I
was received into the gang. Thus I earn my
living by various ways and means. I saw you
a few weeks ago, and beheld you with great
surprise, but was perfectly sure you were the
same person as had been our brave captain.
Thunder and lightning! thought I, how comes
he here? I would have asked you yourself, but
it was open day-light, and we are not fond of
showing ourselves by day; for the sbirri have
hawk's eyes. You were gone immediately;
but I knew not where you lived, and since then
I never could meet with you. I began to think
you were over the hills and far away, when I
unexpectedly met you one night with a girl of
my acquaintance."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How? Do you know the girl?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Know her? Yes, by Heavens!

<!-- page 150 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who is she?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Oh, you must know that well
enough, since you were in her company.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I know her but slightly.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. She is now in the service of the
lady at whose house I found you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I know that, and if you know nothing
more, you are no wiser than myself.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Enough. But I know she is very
good natured.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That I know not.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Then I know more of her than
you. She is exactly like her mistress.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How? Signora Olympia was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Oh heavens! You are neither the
first nor last of her friends, but now it is dangerous.
Seeing this I thought it my duty to warn
you, and wrote the letter which I brought to
you myself. I am glad you attended to it, for
let me be shivered if prince della Torre will
put up with a joke or an insult. He has given
many a man his quietus when he least expected
it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But how comes the prince in question?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. In the most natural way in the
world. He is the friend of the lady you were
visiting, and is most cursedly jealous.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ludovico, I can scarcely believe
this.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Never again call me comrade if I
tell you a lie. I must know something of him,
as I have received his pay for a whole month,

<!-- page 151 -->

and might perhaps have had his orders to give
you your dose. That, however, I would never
have done, devil take me if I would, had I been
reduced to beggary or even burnt upon the rack.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The lady, however, cannot long
have been acquainted with the prince?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. These four days.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is possible.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. 'Tis a fact. That is not her own
apartment where you saw her to-day. But perhaps
you keep her?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By no means. I have only known
her these five days.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Then you do not know her yet.
Nor do I think you would in five times five
years. She is a cursed artful woman. She has
served a certain Captain too a pretty trick.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you know this Captain?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And who is he?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That is known only to the devil.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you do not know him?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Oh, yes! I know a good deal of
him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As for example?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. He is privately the good friend of
every fellow like me in Naples. They all hang
upon him like links of a chain. He is now in
monastery of the Benedictines with a great
apparatus. I know not what scheme he is
upon.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What apparatus?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. He calls up spirits.</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Real spirits?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That is best known to him and the
devil. I have not been there.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ludovico, we are still good friends?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Thunder and lightning! do you
doubt me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then in confidence, I am not without
my company.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That may be. But the rogues are
certainly not here.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In Calabria.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That may be. There is something
to do there.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A fine country for us! Cinthio commands
in my absence.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Thunder and lightning! I must go
there.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will give you money.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Bravo! And I will take half a
dozen good fellows with me who will never
give in. Curse me! this is a bad life we lead
here. Little money and little to eat; and then
a noise and parade about every trifle, as if it
were of the greatest consequence; the sbirri
always at our heels, and the gallows before our
eyes. 'Tis a wretched life! here is my hand.
I will go to Calabria.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Very good! I will give you money
for your travelling expenses.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. But tell me what you do here?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am recruiting.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Leave that business to me. I am

<!-- page 153 -->

better acquainted with the kind of people here
that will answer our purpose.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well, get every one you can. Cinthio
is waiting for recruits.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. He shall have them.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And now a word in confidence.
Would not the Captain&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. He shall know it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I do not mean that.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. What then?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am thinking whether he may not,
perhaps, by fair words be removed to Calabria.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That can hardly be. He lives here
among connexions of too high rank.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But think of it.</p>

<p>Rosalia now awoke; which Rinaldo perceiving
opened the door of the cabinet where
she was, and called her out.&mdash;Ludovico was astonished
at beholding her, but told her he rejoiced
to see her again in good health, and whispered
in Rinaldo's ear, "Signora Olympia is
prettier."</p>

<p>Rinaldo smiled, gave him some money, and
put an end to the visit. Ludovico, however,
asked Rosalia several questions relative to her
escape; and having emptied his glass and promised
to come again soon, went away half
drunk.</p>

<p>The next morning, as Rosalia was assisting
her beloved Rinaldo to dress, she said in a soft
voice:</p>

<p>"My dear Rinaldo, if you really love me, if
you love me but half as much as I love you,

<!-- page 154 -->

oh! grant my ardent request. Associate no
longer with people of Ludovico's stamp, and let
us quit Naples as soon as possible. Let us go
to some other country, where we shall no longer
fall in with old acquaintance of this kind! and if
you abandon me, leave me not in a country
where, perhaps I may come to some disgraceful
end. Ah! all I have ever done is to love you.&mdash;That
is my only crime, if crime it be. Oh, let
me bury it in an honourable grave."</p>

<p>Tears now burst from her eyes, and Rinaldo,
who was much affected, embraced her, saying,</p>

<p>"I know how to value your sincere and
honest heart; and I feel all that your love for
me deserves. What you desire I have already
resolved to perform; and before three days are
past will sail, provided I can find a ship ready
to take her departure for Spain. But should no
such opportunity offer, we will go in the meanwhile
to Sicily. Naples we will leave as soon
as possible. 'Tis more important to me than
you imagine. Ludovico's associates are no longer
mine. And as long as I am in the same
place with him, I am in his power, and I must
flatter him more than I like."</p>

<p>Having said this, he took his sword and went
out to the apartments of Olympia.</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<h3>BOOK IV.</h3>

</div>

<p>RINALDO found Olympia's apartments shut up,
which reminded him of what Ludovico had told
him. He was desirous to convict her of the
double residence spoken of by him. But how
was this to be accomplished? On this he reflected
as he went to the promenade.</p>

<p>"Well!" thought he at length, "she may
live where she will for me! Of what importance
is it? Why should I trouble myself with
any of her concerns? I will leave Naples; for
now I know who she is."</p>

<p>As these reflections passed, he approached
the church of San Lorenzo, which he involuntarily
entered, perhaps through some faint presentiment
or suspicion.</p>

<p>The first object he beheld as he entered
was Olympia, who having said her prayers, shut
her book, and then rising took the arm of a
cavalier, who gave her some holy water, and
accompanied her out of church.</p>

<p>Rinaldo followed her at a distance, and at
length entered the house to which her companion
conducted her. Here he met on the
stairs Olympia's maid, who screamed aloud.</p>

<p>"Do you also live here" said Rinaldo, bitterly;
then passing her, without waiting her answer,
opened the first door he came to, and walked
through an antichamber into the room where
Olympia was sitting on a sofa with her cavalier.</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>On seeing this unexpected visiter Olympia
blushed, while the Cavalier looked alternately
at her and at the bold stranger with the utmost
surprise. Rinaldo was the first man who
came to himself, and now perceived how imprudently
he had acted: but as it was too late
to reflect on steps already taken, he endeavoured
to recover himself, and making a silent
bow to both of them, gave Olympia a significant
look, fixed his eyes somewhat firmly on
her companion, and with another silent bow
retired. But he had scarcely reached the door
of the antichamber when he heard that of the
inner room open, and the cavalier call after him:
"a few words, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now turned round, and with perfect
tranquillity asked, "To what effect?"</p>

<p>"What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"That which I have found."</p>

<p>"But what was the object of your visit?"</p>

<p>"A conviction, which, as I said before, I have
found."</p>

<p>"I demand a clear explanation."</p>

<p>"Make one for yourself."</p>

<p>"Sir, I demand it at the point of the sword."</p>

<p>"At the point of the sword you shall have it."</p>

<p>"Prince," cried Olympia, "I beg of you, suffer
<i>me</i> to explain:" for this was the Prince della
Torre, of whom Ludovico had spoken.</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Here is some secret, of which I must
have the key.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The signora will give it you.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. This gentleman&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. Who is he?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. He is an acquaintance of the Captain,
and probably wished&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince</i>. What does he wish?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Probably he had something to communicate
to me?</p>

<p>The Prince now cast a very expressive look at
her, upon which she seemed confused, turned
pale, and threw herself into a chair.</p>

<p>"Are you not in danger of fainting," said the
Prince in a tone of raillery: and imitating her,
threw himself in like manner into another
chair.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, with the utmost indifference, inquired,
"May I go, or shall I stay?"</p>

<p>"Do as you please," replied the Prince with
precisely the same indifference: upon which
Rinaldo seated himself on a third chair opposite
to them, and contributed to form a silent
group, till Olympia's maid came in: but she
stood in mute astonishment, and forgot what
she was about to say. At length she suddenly
turned round and hurried out.</p>

<p>The Prince now sprang up&mdash;pressed his hat
down upon his face, and left the room without
saying a word.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What have you done?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You know what you have done.
You have imposed on me, cheated me, deceived
me, and betrayed me; and I know, perhaps,
more than you suspect. Signora, remember
the scene when the Captain found us together&mdash;remember

<!-- page 158 -->

what he then said. Now, like him,
I demand my ring again.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. The Captain found us in a very
different situation from that in which you now
saw me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It depended but on me to have
found you so. I need only to have waited a
little longer. I beg to have my ring. I will
purchase it of you.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Wretch that you are! I want not
your gold as long as others will give something
yourself; which is of more value, your ring
or your head?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Both are in my power, most noble&mdash;Count!
I shall expect from you, within four-and-twenty
hours, one thousand ducats, for I
must leave Naples.&mdash;If you will not give it me,
another will give as much for you. Do you
understand me? My maid will receive the
money. Here is your ring. Once more&mdash;do
you understand me? Good bye!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you imagine&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. No excuse, Count, or I will call you
by another name.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By the Captain's perhaps?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I know who is now before me, and
persist in my demand.&mdash;If you do not choose to
pay me, another will pay for you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You shall have the money&mdash;only,
confess you have deceived me.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Why should I confess, when you
believe it already? It can neither tranquillize

<!-- page 159 -->

you, nor make you more unhappy than you
appear to be already. I leave you to pay the
money, and you may wish me a happy journey.
Thus we shall be quit; and if you are wise, you
will also leave Naples, or the prince may destroy
us both. Besides, you have much to fear
from the Captain. For if he cannot save himself
any other way, he will seize upon you as
a dernier resource, and turn you into money.
On this speculation of the Captain alone rests
your present security. You are his corps de
reserve. But now I anticipate him, and seize
the treasure in his stead: for I know no other
way of saving myself. When may I send my
maid?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whenever you please. I wish you
a good journey.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. The same to you&mdash;most terrible
ruler of the Appenines&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Rinaldini!
'Tis very hard truly that such a terrible fellow
as you would be afraid of a poor foolish woman,
who is as rich in love as she is poor in pocket:
and who for a couple of paltry ducats could
send you in chains to Tuscany. But to what
extremes will not the want of money drive the
best of men! Me it might compel to betray,
and you to steal.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I think, signora, that neither of us
has any need to read lectures on morality.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. But one word more as to myself
and the conduct I have held&mdash;when I learnt
from the Captain who you were, I perceived
his intentions&mdash;and as I loved you&mdash;and love

<!-- page 160 -->

you still&mdash;I thought it my duty to protect my
lover against him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am obliged to you.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. This was the cause of my acquaintance
with the Prince. I would have taken an
opportunity to have brought you acquainted
with each other, but you have marred all my
plans. It was chance, however, that brought
it about, and therefore we must not reproach
each other.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Thus, then, I am indebted to your
kindness.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. 'Twill be requited by the sum I
mention.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If it can be requited it shall. Have
we done?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I hope so. But do you know any
thing yet, that&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have nothing more to say, except
that I have now gained a new piece of knowledge
of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Indeed! Then turn it to advantage.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That I certainly shall. When we
are alone it will be an amusement to think of
each other. This permission I at least purchase.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Surely&mdash;and should we meet any
where at a future time&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. We will be utter strangers.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Agreed.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now took his leave and hastened to
the harbour, but in his way very unexpectedly

<!-- page 161 -->

fell in with the Captain, who gave him a wink;
in consequence of which he very unwillingly
followed him to a retired place.</p>

<p>"Let us not," said the Captain, "talk of old
affairs: for what has happened has happened;
and what is past is past. We have only to do
with the present. I am in want of money, and
on this occasion I apply to you, because I know
you have what I want. Lend me two thousand
ducats, for which I will give you my silence as
security? And if you know how to make use
of Signora Olympia, as Prince della Torre apparently
does, I borrow on a still better fund."</p>

<p>"I know," said Rinaldo, "how much I am
indebted to you, and what I have to thank you
for. I know the part you have taken in my
fortune, and am much indebted to you. Therefore,
when I present you with two thousand
ducats, I beg you to accept it merely as a small
mark of my heartfelt gratitude. I am not,
however, provided with so much ready cash as
you may imagine; but I will turn some valuables
into money, and you shall have what you
want within two days."</p>

<p>"Friend," said the Captain, "my necessities
are pressing. I had rather have the money to-day
than to-morrow or next day."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Rinaldo, "I will procure it
by to-morrow evening, when I shall hope to see
you at my apartments."</p>

<p>He now with a silent bow took leave of the
Captain, who looked after him as he went to
the harbour, where lay a Genoese ship that

<!-- page 162 -->

was about to weigh anchor in an oar and sail
for Malta.</p>

<p>Rinaldo spoke with the Captain, and told
him he wished to take his passage with him; to
which the Captain replied, "I will receive you
on board with pleasure, but I must inform you
of what you do not perhaps know, and which I
have this moment learnt. About an hour ago,
an order has been published to receive no passengers
on board any ship without a passport
from the police, under pain of confiscating the
ship's cargo. I know not the motive of this
order, but in all probability there is some suspicious
person in the city, and this is the method
taken to catch him."</p>

<p>"Most probably," returned Rinaldo with perfect
indifference, but palpitating heart. "However,
I will procure such a passport."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo returned home with the
utmost anxiety, and like one in a dream. "If I
am so well known here," thought he, "I had
better go back and hide myself in my woods and
caves."</p>

<p>He found Ludovico in his room talking with
Rosalia. To them he related what had happened
at the harbour, at which Rosalia trembled,
and Ludovico was confounded. They
looked at each other and were silent.</p>

<p>At length Rinaldo seemed to recover from
his alarm:</p>

<p>"Ludovico," said he, "you are a very honest
fellow; to you I will entrust this girl and this
trunk. Conduct her to some place of safety,

<!-- page 163 -->

and I will quit Naples as secretly as possible.
You will follow me to Cosenza, where we will
in all events meet, for neither of us must quit it
till the other arrives. I know that I am certainly
betrayed, and must save my person. You
will travel as privately as possible."</p>

<p>He now put on his pilgrim's dress, took with
him as many jewels as he could conveniently
pack up and conceal about him, and set on
without delay. Ludovico swore fidelity to him,
and Rosalia burst into tears.</p>

<p>Rinaldo found no impediment to quitting the
city, and took the road to Salerno, whence,
without venturing to stay there long, he pursued
his way to Clarimonte, where, being extremely
fatigued, he was obliged to take up his
quarters for some time, and in a miserable inn,
struggled with the pains of his body and the
anguish of his soul. His feet were very sore,
much blistered, and swelled. He wished himself
dead, yet dared not to put an end to his
life.</p>

<p>A very worthy physician attended him, assuaged
his corporeal pains, and endeavoured,
though with little success, to cheer his mind
with friendly conversation.</p>

<p>At length Rinaldo again set forward, and hastened
to the mountains of Mormando, over
which he travelled toward Cosenza, passing
many a hermitage that reminded him of his
friend Donato, as every monastery did of Aurelia,
and every wild mountain scene of the life he
had led among the Appenines.</p>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p>Once being oppressed by the heat of the
day, he threw himself down beneath some poplars,
and abandoned himself to peaceful contemplations,
till at length he was suddenly
alarmed by a noise near him. On looking up
he beheld two men standing by him, whose appearance
resembled that of his former comrades.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said one of them.</p>

<p>"A pilgrim, as you see," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To the miraculous image of the holy virgin
at Cosenza."</p>

<p>"Can you do nothing better?"</p>

<p>"I am ill and weak, and hope to find relief
there."</p>

<p>"We will lighten your burden at least. Take
out your purse and give it us."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"We are men who live by our wits."</p>

<p>"I have no money."</p>

<p>"We don't believe you."</p>

<p>"Then you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"No expostulations! We have no time to
lose in disputing."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of the celebrated Rinaldini?"</p>

<p>"O yes."</p>

<p>"He suffered no pilgrim to be plundered.
His friend Cinthio once met&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cinthio?"</p>

<p>"Why do you take so much notice of that
brave fellow's name?</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<p>"Why should we not? 'Tis the name of our
captain."</p>

<p>"Your captain? Where is he? Lead me
to him. He knows me. I once rendered him
a service which he promised to return. Now is
the time for him to keep his word."</p>

<p>The two thieves looked at each other with
surprise, and Rinaldo got up, took his pilgrim-staff,
and was about to set off when one of them
cried:&mdash;"Not a step from this spot!" and held a
pistol to him.</p>

<p>"I would be carried to your captain," said
Rinaldo firmly. "He would not suffer me to be
robbed."</p>

<p>"Not so bold, fellow!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you fear I should inform against
you? I give you my word I will not. You are
silent? I will keep my word. I honour you
highly when I request you to conduct me to
Cinthio."</p>

<p>"O ho! upon honour!"</p>

<p>"I swear to you that Cinthio will reward
you handsomely for conducting me to him. I
am a man."</p>

<p>"That we perceive, but will not carry you to
our captain. Your purse or a ball through your
brains. Choose."</p>

<p>"Fire if you dare&mdash;&mdash;I am Rinaldini."</p>

<p>Upon this they dropped their arms, and fell
at his feet.</p>

<p>"I will keep my word," said Rinaldo, "Lead
me to your captain, and I will beside give each
of you ten ducats."</p>

<!-- page 166 -->

<p>They now sprang up greatly rejoiced, waved
their hats in the air, kissed his hands and showed
him the way&mdash;but when they perceived how
tired he was, they joined hands and carried
him to Cinthio's abode, which was a vast cavern.
Cinthio was now encamped in front of it, in a
tent, where he had thrown himself on a field-bed,
and was thinking of Rinaldini at the very time
when this singular group approached.</p>

<p>His people now set down their pretended
pilgrim before the field-bed, and one of them
said,</p>

<p>"Captain, this is a valuable load. The sbirri
would not have brought him in so easy a manner.
Here he is. Look at him yourself, and
tell us who he is?"</p>

<p>Cinthio cast his eyes upon Rinaldini, but could
not utter a word: for a sudden sensation ran
through his soul, and an unaccountable trepidation
robbed him of his speech.</p>

<p>"Do you no longer know me?" said Rinaldo
in a faint voice.</p>

<p>Cinthio now rushed towards him, and pressed
him to his bosom, while tears trembled in his
eyes, and bedewed his darksome cheeks. Silent
and confused stood his companions around him,
while he cried aloud,</p>

<p>"Do I then see you again, Rinaldini, my
friend? Do I again hear you speak! And is it
not a dream?"</p>

<p>Upon this every one exclaimed as from one
mouth,</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>"Long live the great Rinaldini, and Cinthio
his friend, our brave captain!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo now related his story to his friend,
who heard him without interruption, but when
he had concluded, said,</p>

<p>"See, Rinaldini, will you believe me now,
when I tell you we never can resume our places,
or be thought of any value in society?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am now convinced. Experience
has proved it.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Let us live in woods and mountains,
and avoid the high towered cities. In Calabria
our business will thrive. Nature seems to have
formed that country expressly for us. The farther
we penetrate into it the better we shall be,
nor shall we ever want for a living. I am
at the head of eighty men and can have more
whenever I please. But now I resign my place
of captain.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Keep what is your own, and let me
inhabit one of the most retired corners of Calabria
as a hermit.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Are you in your senses? May you
not be discovered, and, thus defenceless, be
thrown into the power of the law? From the
story you have told I learn that you have an
enemy whom you ought to fear. If any one
tracks you out it must be the captain, who has
resolved to live at your expense. But if you
were at the head of my eighty men, he would
not hurt a hair of your head. As a defenceless
hermit you may soon be taken and compelled
to yield to superior force. Mankind pursue

<!-- page 168 -->

you, the police have set a price upon your head,
and your own name follows you every where like
a crime. At the head of your comrades alone
you will find esteem and safety. Can you
not choose?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Let me but recover my strength, and
then I will think of it. Here is money; divide
it among your people, and set me at rest, that I
may be again Rinaldini; for my spirit is gone
from me, and my strength is no more.</p>

<p>Cinthio now set off with his company, and
removed to a ruined castle where he had arranged
some rooms, in which he lodged his
friend, who after much care and attention, by
degrees recovered his strength.</p>

<p>He now informed Cinthio that he must go to
Cosenza, and for what reason, Ludovico and
Rosalia having directions to wait his arrival
there. But Cinthio would not admit of it, and
desired him to write a letter to Rosalia, which
he resolved to carry himself. Rinaldo, unable
to oppose his arguments, at length permitted
his friend to go to Cosenza, and in the meanwhile
took command of his company, anxiously
waiting his return.</p>

<p>A week after his departure some of the
band brought Rosalia, together with Rinaldo's
trunks and packages, safely to him. Ludovico
also accompanied them, but in chains. Cinthio
was not with them, and some of his people delivered
to Rinaldo a letter from him to the following
effect,</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p class="small">"Rinaldo, I resign to you the command of
my company. When I see you again I will
tell you where I now am, and what I have
done. I have taken one hundred ducats out of
your stock, which I may perhaps employ in executing
my present plans: if not, they shall be
returned. Ludovico will himself tell you the
reason of my sending him to you in chains. You
will then best know what you ought to do with
him. Adieu. CINTHIO."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now called Ludovico forth, and Rosalia
reclined upon his bosom.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Why do you bear these chains?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. In consequence of my treachery.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Treachery!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. I am a villain! and have discovered
myself to Cinthio. From you I wait my
sentence; for 'twas you my treachery concerned.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Me!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Hear my confession, and judge me
according to my deserts.&mdash;'Twas I betrayed you
at Naples! Through me the accursed Captain
knew who you were!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is it possible!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. 'Tis the truth. Doubt it not. But
when I came to my senses I repented of what
I had done, and set about repairing my fault.
You know how I have since then served you.
With Rosalia I quitted Naples in the greatest
danger, and have brought her to Cosenza.

<!-- page 170 -->

Your property I have respected; and with repentance
for my accursed discovery I have
martyr'd myself, like a repentant sinner with
flagellation. But at length I was compelled to
let all come out, and I confessed. Cinthio
chained me; and I deserved it. Yet it was of
no use; for I should, at all events, have come to
you to hear my sentence from your mouth. Pronounce
it and punish me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Captain!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I forgive you all.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Let me be flogged! let me be
hanged! forgive me not so easily.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am in safety. Rosalia and my
treasure are secure, what more can I wish?
You have acted honourably with regard to my
property; these services you have rendered me,
and I forgive you. If you wish it you may
stay with me; for I am satisfied you will not
again betray me.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Indeed I will not. See, Captain,
I cannot help these tears, though 'tis a shame.
Do punish me, however, in some way, or I can
never look you in the face again. I cannot rest
if you let me off so easy.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well then, you shall be punished;
remind me of it four weeks hence, in which
time, perhaps I may find a proper punishment
for you.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. I will not fail to remind you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now go free and acquitted to my

<!-- page 171 -->

people to whom you belong. I rely upon you in
case of danger.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. My poor life shall be at your command.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will call as many of my people as
are here in the neighbourhood, and take off
your chains, that they may know I hold you to
be innocent.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Captain, if I forget that kindness, I
will suffer my head to be cut off.</p>

<p>Rosalia's joy at meeting with Rinaldo exceeded
the power of description: for her whole
soul seemed to exist but in his, and for him alone
she lived; while he speedily recovered under
the care and attention of his beloved. His
mind also daily regained its cheerfulness, and
he enjoyed the beauteous scenes of nature with
increasing sensibility.</p>

<p>This peaceful tranquillity, however, was less
pleasing to his companions than to himself, and
one of them thus addressed him in the name of
the rest:</p>

<p>"Is it really the great Rinaldini that lies
here thus inactive, and only toying with this
girl? Do not at least encourage us to follow
this example. If you would be our captain, find
us employment."</p>

<p>"I am not inclined," replied Rinaldo, "to
send you on the road to tear from the poor
traveller the last penny which is to support
him on his journey. I would rather give you
so much myself without force. But if you can

<!-- page 172 -->

point out any enterprise that is worthy of me, I
will presently show you that I am Rinaldini."</p>

<p>"To judge of this," replied Albonicorno, for
that was the name of the orator, "is not our
part; 'tis enough that we are not here, to sit
with our hands in our bosoms like useless idlers.
Thunder and lightning! shall we have the
famous Rinaldini for our leader that we may
bury ourselves in the mountains. This we
might do without your assistance. Our wine bottles
are as empty as our pockets.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well! get some wine from the best
of the monasteries.</p>

<p><i>Albonicorno</i>. How is that to be done?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is your affair.</p>

<p><i>Albonicorno</i>. If we had a captain&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If a battle be necessary, your captain
will be there.</p>

<p><i>Albonicorno</i>. Who would fight with such fellows;
men that would throw their breviary at
the head of the devil himself?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Does that frighten you? It may be
done with perfect ease and quiet. Take the abbot,
and you will have plenty of wine.</p>

<p><i>Albonicorno</i>. That is easily said. But do not
these gentlemen always sit at home, like a hen
upon her chickens? Give us something better
to do.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To-morrow I will look about in the
valley: perhaps something will fall out, or
something occur to my mind that may help you
to some work. Leave it to me: I am in fortune's
good graces.</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>The next morning Rinaldo, according to his
promise, went into the valley, and approached
the town of Fiscaldo, at the time when the inhabitants
were celebrating the feast of their
patroness with dancing and singing. Booths
were erected and filled with various goods, and
stages from which monks were selling amulets,
consecrated chaplets of roses, and other reliques.
The poor Calabrians crowded round their
stages, and brought thither their little savings,
which were all swallowed up by the great box
of the spiritual empirics, whose stock, though
large, was insufficient to satisfy the continual
demand of the crowd that continually flowed towards
his stage.</p>

<p>"These impostors," thought Rinaldo, "shall
not carry all this treasure home." He therefore
sent Ludovico back, and gave him directions
to Albonicorno and some others, to be on
the watch, pointing out what they were to do
in order to take their box of treasure from the
monks. This plan was executed toward evening.</p>

<p>In a corner where stood the image of the holy
virgin, some poor Calabrians, who had nothing
else to give, showed their piety and devotion
by performing a concert to the holy virgin.*
Rinaldo joined the party, expressed his approbation
to the pious musicians, and gave the poor
people some money: "because," as he said,
"the holy virgin had revealed to him that she

<!-- page 174 -->

did not desire to have any thing gratis, and that
he should pay for her."</p>

<p class="small">[*See Voyage Pittoresque en Naples et Sicile, vol. I. p. 240.]</p>

<p>The musicians thanked him very gratefully,
took the money, and brought it to the spiritual
shop, where it was all thrown into the great box,
and thus found its way back into the hands of
Rinaldini.</p>

<p>Two ladies in masks, who were walking with
a cavalier in the marketplace, now attracted
Rinaldo's attention; and he had scarcely begun
to approach them, when one of them appeared
also to remark him, and evidently endeavoured
to get near him, till at length she whispered
without being noticed,</p>

<p>"Welcome, Count Mandochini!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo started, and asked, "Who speaks?"</p>

<p>"An acquaintance," answered she, and rejoined
her company.</p>

<p>Rinaldo paused and fixed his eyes on her as
she went, till she was lost in the crowd, then
stepped aside, and while examining his pistols
some one clapped him on the shoulder. He
turned round with affright, and perceived it was
Cinthio.</p>

<p>"Cinthio! are you here?"</p>

<p>"Not only! but some of your acquaintance."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That I have already heard?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A lady in a mask called me by
the name I used at Naples&mdash;Count Mandochini.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Well! and do you not guess?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What should I guess?</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. In Cosenza I have been watching
your acquaintance, and have followed them
every where. They are both here, and I think
they will soon be in our power.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Who? How can you ask that question?
Who but the artful Captain and the beautiful
Signora Olympia.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is it possible?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. 'Tis certain. They seem to live
with a gentleman in the neighbourhood, whom
they will probably join their heads to plunder.
But we will in our turns plunder these cut-purses
so completely that they shall never
forget us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile came Bramante, one of his company,
hastily toward him, saying:</p>

<p>"Captain, yonder is a gentleman in company
with some other gentlemen and ladies, who
speaks out clearly the name of Rinaldini! One
of them called to two sbirri, and another was
talking with an officer of militia! I hastened
hither to inform you of these circumstances!"</p>

<p>"You now perceive," said Cinthio, "that I said
no more than the truth. I know the roads
about this place. Bramante, watch for them.
We shall go to the hermitage of San Sepolcro.
If you meet with any of our band, let them join
you. You will wait for us near the poplar grove
under the hermitage."</p>

<p>Bramante immediately sat off, and Cinthio
led Rinaldo through some ruined aqueducts out
of the town of Fiscaldo.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>Meanwhile Bramante met three of his companions
at the Poplar Grove. They were
upon the heights of San Sepolcro when they
heard the drums beat, and immediately after a
confused noise of bells, upon which the whole
valley was in an uproar. Perceiving this, they
passed the ridge of the mountain, and near their
quarters, fell in with a joyous party of their
people who had taken away two boxes full of
money, apparently very heavy, from the spiritual
shops.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival they packed up their
baggage and departed; and passing the mountain,
left a guard of three men by San Paola;
and further on, a guard of six men. They then
went to the heights of San Lucito, the avenues
to which they strongly manned. Here, amid,
dreadful rocks and precipices, they pitched
their tents.</p>

<p>It was midnight ere Rinaldo. who was extremely
fatigued, threw himself upon his bed.
Rosalia trimmed the lamp and laid down beside
him. But Rinaldo had scarcely closed his eyes
before a loud scream from Rosalia awaked
him. He started up and would have inquired
what was the matter, when a tall white figure
appeared standing at the entrance of his tent,
and having twice beckoned with its finger, disappeared.</p>

<p>Rinaldo sprang up, went out of the tent,
found the guards awake, and those who were
nearest to the tent knew not what to answer,
when he inquired if nothing had happened.

<!-- page 177 -->

<p>He returned to the tent and found Rosalia
much dejected; for she remembered a similar
appearance in the Appenines. Rinaldo also
became very pensive. At length he fell asleep,
and was waked by Cinthio at break of day.</p>

<p>"I will take twenty men with me," said the
latter, "and reconnoitre in the vallies."</p>

<p>When he was gone, Rinaldo called Ludovico,
and said, "Now Ludovico, is the time for
your punishment.&mdash;The Captain and Signora
Olympia are somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Fiscaldo; go, and do not return till you
bring me intelligence where they are, so that
we may drive them out."</p>

<p>"That shall soon be done," said Ludovico,
and immediately set off.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now looked out for a couple of
secret places, and accompanied, by Rosalia,
buried his most precious jewels in the earth.
This done, he gave the signal of departure,
mustered his corps, found it to be fifty-six
strong, and well-armed, gave the word and descended
into the valley.</p>

<p>He had not marched far when he perceived
the beating of drums in the distance. Upon
this he halted, to secure a retreat; but soon
heard firing in the distance, and therefore sent
spies to the heights.</p>

<p>The firing approached, and at length intelligence
arrived from his spies that Cinthio and his
people were fighting with the militia and the
sbirri in the valley of San Lucito. Upon this

<!-- page 178 -->

he sent twelve men to reinforce him, and followed
them himself with the remainder.</p>

<p>The firing became more rapid as he approached
nearer to the scene of action. But
now some men came flying toward him, which
gave him hopes. He was still advancing, however,
without suspecting the enemy to be near,
when his corps was fired on from the heights.
On looking up, he perceived that they were
occupied by militia, upon which he quickened
his march, and at length arrived just in good
time in the field of battle.</p>

<p>Cinthio's corps had been very roughly handled,
and scarcely twelve men were now fighting,
like desperadoes, against a force ten times
their strength; and had they not been a band
of Robbers, their achievements would have procured
them the name of heroes.</p>

<p>Rinaldo and his men now rushed upon the
soldiers and sbirri with such fury that being
surprised at this sudden onset, they were obliged
to give back, and Rinaldo followed them
step for step. Meanwhile Cinthio collected his
little troop, brought those who were dispersed,
together with the men at various posts, and
thus again was thirty men strong.</p>

<p>With them he hastened to reinforce Rinaldo,
whom he rejoined, reaching him as he was retreating.
But the militia having brought their
cannon with them, had made such good use of
them that Rinaldo had scarcely twenty men to
oppose them.</p>

<p>When Cinthio arrived, both corps united and

<!-- page 179 -->

returned the charge. Suddenly about thirty
dragoons attacked them in the flank, and in a
moment Rinaldo with two of his men were cut
off and surrounded. Rinaldo broke his sabre,
his pistols were discharged, his comrades fell
by his side with musket shot, and he was obliged
to surrender. This capture cost sixteen of
the soldiers their lives.</p>

<p>Enraged at the death of their companions,
the troops vehemently beat Rinaldo, who received
their blows without giving any sign
who he was. At length two of them bound
him between their horses, and took him to a
castle where he was thrown into a dark dungeon,
and after an interval of some hours, obtained
some straw to lie on, and some bread
and water for his supper.</p>

<p>Being extremely fatigued, he sunk upon his
wretched bed, overpowered with grief and sorrow;
but neither wept nor complained. At
length, being quite exhausted, he fell asleep.
He had not however been long in this situation
before he dreamed that Rosalia was standing
by his side. He awoke, started up, perceived
a light in the prison, and saw a lady in a veil
standing by him.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" cried Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Be not afraid," said she "and answer me
truly and frankly. You may repent should you
refuse."</p>

<p>"What would you know of me?"</p>

<p>"Are you Count Mandochini?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>"Then you are Rinaldini," said she, and left
the dungeon.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now began to reflect what this might
signify, when the gate of his prison opened, and
an old man entered with bread and water,
which he left and went out.</p>

<p>Day was now succeeded by night, and Rinaldo
lay in silent obscurity on his straw bed,
when the door was again opened and the lady
in a veil entered with a light.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who is there?</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. The object we have once loved we
cannot easily hate. We have seen each other
once, and were happy. How is it possible I
should forget it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Heavens! I should know that
voice.</p>

<p><i>Lady</i>. At Naples you cheated me of the
money for my journey, but I am now better off
than you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Olympia!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Do you know me now?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What am I to expect of you?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Magnanimity.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Olympia!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I saw you as you were brought hither,
and knew you. In the castle they know
not what a precious bird they have caught,
otherwise you would certainly not be left unchained.
It depends on me to procure you
fetters.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then let me have them.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Obstinate man.</p>

<!-- page 181 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What would you here?

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Guess.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Torment me! That I can bear.
Pity me! That I desire not. Let me die!
That is my wish.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Proud man! I will save you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Yes, I.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Olympia!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I, who loved you, and love you still.
But I am not disinterested.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That I believe. But I have nothing
by me to give you, except this purse.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Money I want not, I have purses
now for you. I only wish for a written acknowledgment
that you are indebted to me for your
life.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Has that yet happened?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. It shall and will happen.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. As I please. As I have planned it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh my dear betrayer! What
would I not do for you? I will even now take
you out of this dungeon. At the castle gate a
servant is in waiting for you with a horse loaded
with clothes for your accommodation. In the
port is a Genoese galley ready to sail for Sicily,
on board of which you will go to Messina as the
Knight della Cintra, under which name I have
procured you this passport. In Palermo you
will go to the house of Marchese Romano, and
give him this letter, which will procure you a

<!-- page 182 -->

kind reception&mdash;and here is a purse of one
hundred ducats.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Money I want not&mdash;I have some
with me, and also some jewels.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Well, then I will take the money
again. But the writing I have asked for I must
have. Here is a pencil and paper, with which
you must contrive to write it as well as you can.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Here is the writing; but how shall
I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. No delay! We will talk of that
another time.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But if I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Lose no time! You are in the
castle of the Prince della Torre, whom you
know. If we are discovered we are both lost.
Give me a kiss and then follow me.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now quitted the dungeon, and passed
through the court to an open gate, where having
again kissed his inamorata he left the castle.</p>

<p>A few paces from it he found the horse and
servant waiting for him, and having instantly
mounted, set off in a hard trot. They soon
reached the harbour, where he gave his attendant
some money, who having loosed the portmanteau
from the horse, instantly returned. Rinaldo
dressed himself behind a hedge in a travelling
dress, which he found in the portmanteau,
where he packed up the clothes he had taken
off.</p>

<p>The sun was now down; and Rinaldo taking
his portmanteau under his arm, approached the
port, where he showed his passport to the

<!-- page 183 -->

officer on duty, and was allowed without further
impediment to pursue his way.</p>

<p>He immediately went on board the promised
galley, which having weighed anchor set sail,
while Rinaldo cast a lingering look toward the
shore, and sighed out, "Rosalia! Rosalia!"</p>

<p>Having arrived at Messina, Rinaldo had
scarcely taken up his quarters and dressed himself
before he hastened to the Marchese Romano
to deliver Olympia's letter.</p>

<p>He found the marquis surrounded by company,
who were on a visit at his house, and to
whom he introduced him. The marquis having
read the letter, received him very kindly, and
presented him to his company, which consisted
of princes, counts, countesses, and baronesses,
who were delighted with their new acquaintance,
but had not the remotest idea they had so
notorious a captain of banditti in their illustrious
circle.</p>

<p>The Cavalier della Cintra was now asked innumerable
questions, his answers to which gave
general satisfaction, and even attracted the
regards of some of the most beautiful of the
women. Every one confessed the chevalier
was a very handsome man; and the men considered
him as an accomplished travelled gentleman.
They offered him all kinds of attentions
and services; and the marquis Romano
would not be satisfied till his guest promised to
take up his abode in his house.</p>

<p>Thus in a few days was the scene of our new
made knight's adventures changed from a den

<!-- page 184 -->

of robbers and murderers amid the crags of inhospitable
rocks, first to a loathsome dungeon,
and then to the best society Sicily could afford,
in the gorgeous saloons of a magnificent palace.</p>

<p>Before the company parted Rinaldo received
various invitations; after which his host requested
his company to a <i>tete-a-tete</i>.</p>

<p>They now adjourned to a pavilion in a beautiful
garden, where having seated themselves,
the Marquis, pouring out some wine, drank "To
our better acquaintance!" After a few more
glasses and toasts, they began to converse as
follows:</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. Our friend Olympia has recommended
you to me so strongly that I scruple
not immediately to call you by the honourable
title of friend.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You do me uncommon honour.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. A man of such talents, and of so
much science as you, has doubtless the best
possible claim to it, and the more nearly society
are acquainted with you, the more it must redound
to your honour and to their advantage.
All my other guests, who are men of good heads
and hearts, certainly expect to find in you an
associate abounding in wit and courage.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I beg of you to explain yourself.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. That I will readily do: There exists
a certain grand association in the world,
which, however convenience sometimes breaks,
is ever re-established by men of sense and
talents, through whom it will become universal.
In the state of the church, in the dominions of

<!-- page 185 -->

Naples and Sicily, a great number of men are
known to each other through the means of this
establishment, and for the promotion of its
objects.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am convinced that from you I
shall hear the truth.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. You do hear it. Reciprocal wants
generate reciprocal aid and reciprocal participation.
'Tis enough to say they know each
other, and can reckon upon finding friends every
where.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A very comfortable assurance.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. You think so?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I feel it so.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. Then you are one of us.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As to the universal alliance of
friendship, I am. But I seem to be the only
gainer by it.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. By no means. We gain with and
through you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My worthy friend you know not&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. I know what I am permitted to
know. You pass as yet with this society for
the knight della Cintra till we learn more of
you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Marquis! You know also&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. I salute you as a man who is
feared.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Has Olympia then?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. The secret of your true name remains
as safely locked up in my breast as in your
own.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But what can induce you to introduce

<!-- page 186 -->

me, whose name and actions are so much
decried, into a society, whose members are so
noble, so illustrious, and free from every spot
of plebeianism?</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. What can hinder us from calling
you friend? Especially if we find out for you
a new sphere of action, the consequences of
which will be quite sufficient for the completion
of our plan? A little interest, however, must
prevail even in the best of the society. All
this time will explain to you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have the advantage of you in this
game: for I can but gain by it.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. Through you we also win. Profit
and gain are obedient to our call. Upon that
rest at ease. Shall we call one another brothers?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If I may.</p>

<p><i>Marquis</i>. I give you the brother's kiss.</p>

<p>Thus ended their conference for the present;
and the Marquis's family assembled to supper.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was now full of thought, hoping for
the development of a riddle, the explanation of
which he could not discover.</p>

<p>Thus he lived in a continual round of company
and visiting, amid the gayest entertainments
and the most splendid balls, hurried on
from one amusement to another, so that he had
scarcely time to reflect for a moment upon his
present situation.</p>

<p>Among the ladies with whom he became acquainted
were two who particularly attracted
his attention; a very beautiful young lady,

<!-- page 187 -->

whose name was Laura, only daughter of Baron
Denongo, one of the best families and richest
fortunes in the island, and the countess of Martagno,
a very accomplished woman, of most
agreeable manners, and though less beautiful
than Laura, uncommonly interesting. She was
a widow in her twenty-second year, and possessed
of a considerable jointure.</p>

<p>These two ladies not only interested our cavalier,
but they were said to have been by no
means indifferent to him.</p>

<p>At a fete given by the countess, the ladies
having collected together to hear some music,
Laura taking a guitar, performed a song, which
was much praised and admired.&mdash;The countess
then took the instrument and sang with universal
applause, except from Laura, whose silence,
however, was only observed by Rinaldo.</p>

<p>The countess looked for his approbation in
his countenance, and then turned her eyes towards
Laura, who cast hers on the ground.
This circumstance struck the countess, but she
sprang up, and gave the signal for the dance.</p>

<p>The first lady to whom Rinaldo offered his
hand was Laura, who appeared very happy,
and whose eyes often interchanged glances with
Rinaldo's. Of this the countess was not unobservant.
She saw more than pleased her, and
more than she wished to see.</p>

<p>The dance being finished, she came forward
and said, she wished to find a good partner in a
fandango. She soon found one, and performed
that fascinating dance with the utmost grace,

<!-- page 188 -->

never taking her eyes from Rinaldo, who stood
among the spectators near Laura, by whom he
was asked how he liked the dance.</p>

<p>"So well," replied he, "that I would not on
any consideration in the world, that my beloved
should dance it with any other man than me."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well," replied Laura, smiling, "that
sentiment concerns neither you nor the countess."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the cavalier, composed.</p>

<p>The dance being concluded, the countess
threw herself into a chair, fanned herself with
her handkerchief, beckoned Rinaldo to her,
and said, "How do you think I dance the fandango?"</p>

<p>"So well," replied he, "that I envy the man
who was your partner."</p>

<p>"Then you shall dance it with me next," said
the countess, smiling.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was about to reply, when the countess's
partner came up to her, and reproached
her with having pressed him too hard.</p>

<p>"What harm can that do you?" said the
countess, evidently disconcerted.</p>

<p>Rinaldo waited not his answer, but turning
round, entered into conversation with the Marquis
Romano.</p>

<p>Presently after the countess came up to him,
and asked him to follow her, took him into a
small room, not unobserved by Laura, who
drew near the door, where she threw herself
on a sofa, with an air of indifference, though
with the most eager attention and curiosity.</p>

<!-- page 189 -->

<p>"Knight," said the countess, "some letters
for you have been confided to my care. I deliver
them to you, and you may read them here
alone, if you would avoid being disturbed."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How so?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. By thinking of this or that affair, or
perhaps of this or that lady.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I mean nothing, only I think so.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But I know not what&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. What the lady's name may be, certainly
not Martagno. She must have a very
tender name. Something romantic and heroic,
as Laura, or the like. I am, alas! only Dianora,
which is not a poetical, still less a sentimental
name. But do not suffer yourself to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Having said this she left the room, and Rinaldo
opened the letter, which was from Olympia,
enclosing others for the marquis Romano
and baron Malvento. That to himself was as
follows:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Dear Knight,</p>

<p>"I hope this finds you well; for you are at
least in the best hands in the world. In virtue
of your written promise I desire you to show
your gratitude to me by obeying the marquis
Romano in all things. He will tell you that it
is time to introduce you to the old man of Fronteja,
which you must by no means neglect. Perhaps
we shall soon see each other.</p>

<p>"I must inform you of the news; namely,

<!-- page 190 -->

that the band of the notorious robber Rinaldini
is completely exterminated. Nine of them who
had been taken alive, were yesterday shot at
San Lucito. They all declared that Rinaldini
himself had been cut to pieces, and fallen by
their side. Every one rejoices that this dangerous
man has been thus destroyed, as indeed he
must necessarily have been, since his little troop
was surrounded by one thousand four hundred
men. One Cinthio indeed cut his way through
together with a few of his party; but people are
gone in pursuit of him.</p>

<p>"Another piece of news, that a certain captain
of your acquaintance has been almost killed
by one Ludovico, who stabbed him in twelve
places. He now lies dangerously ill; but the
assassin has escaped.</p>

<p>"Adieu. Remember who still loves you.</p>

<p>"Olympia."</p>

</div>

<p>Rinaldo had read the letter, and folded it up,
when Laura entered the room in search, as she
said, of a friend whom she did not find, notwithstanding
which she staid there.</p>

<p>A conversation on different subjects now
arose between them, during which they unexpectedly
came into the gallery leading to the
saloon. Here they walked on still talking, and
at length came into a brilliant apartment, where
the table was set out.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. It must be confessed the countess
lives well here. Her house is certainly one of
the best in Messina.</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. On that subject I cannot judge.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. You may take it on my word.  Besides
she is a lady of uncommon wit and taste, and
very amiable. 'Tis said she is to be married
to the gentleman with whom she danced the
fandango.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Such at least is the common report.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I hope she will be happy.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Why are you still unmarried?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have enough to live decently myself,
but not to maintain a wife.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Then you will marry a woman who
has a fortune of her own.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Provided she loves me.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. That is presupposed. How long do
you intend to stay at Messina?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As long as I like the place.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Well, and how do you like it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Very much.</p>

<p>They had now returned along the gallery into
the drawing room, which Laura presently left
unobserved. Meanwhile Rinaldo delivered the
enclosed letters from Olympia, and returning
back into the small room in thoughtful mood,
threw himself upon a sofa.</p>

<p>Here he continued unobserved till the sound
of trumpets called him to table. Both Laura
and the countess had missed him, and each
anxiously sought him every where but in the
right place.</p>

<p>At table, Rinaldo being a stranger, was placed
next to the lady of the house, while Laura

<!-- page 192 -->

sat on the opposite side. His reflections made
him absent, and he behaved very unceremoniously
toward his neighbour and the marchioness,
which secretly gave Laura the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>Baron Malvento now entertained the company
with the fate of Rinaldini in Calabria, and
the conversation becoming general, every one
delivered his sentiments.</p>

<p>Laura said this highwayman had died too
honourably, and that he ought to have been
broken on the wheel; which gave Rinaldo a
sensation by which this merciless girl lost a
part of her influence upon his heart. The
countess said, "Rinaldini was a great man, and
had he but commanded an army would have
obtained everlasting fame;" and this generous
sentiment gave the countess that place in his
heart which Laura had just unconsciously abandoned.</p>

<p>The marquis Romano told the company his
friend the cavalier had assured him he had
known Rinaldini; and upon this every one
overwhelmed him with questions.</p>

<p>Laura asked him, "What he thought of this
king of thieves?"</p>

<p>"As for me," said Rinaldo, "he treated me
very well. I was in his power, and he did not
abuse it."</p>

<p>"How did he look?" said the countess.</p>

<p>"More noble than his course of life should
seem to permit," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Laura continued to abuse Rinaldini,

<!-- page 193 -->

till the conversation, much to his satisfaction,
turned upon another subject.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night passed away in
dancing; and day now beginning to dawn, Rinaldo
did not return home but took a walk among
the country houses and gardens in the neighbourhood
of the city, to enjoy the beauties of
the morning, which now with dewy wings shed
its beaming lustre over the flowery vales. His
feet brushed away the dew, forming a line
across the meadows, and he looked for an
eminence, from which to command the view of
the surrounding country. The golden rays of
the sun played over the pearly herbage with
innumerable brilliant colours. Heaven and
earth appeared newly roused from refreshing
sleep; and Aurora from her roseate gate seemed
to lead on a new train of ideas and sensations
in Rinaldo's mind. He leaned against a lofty
pine, and cast his eyes over the brilliant vale,
and was affected even to tears with the beauties
he beheld. Even in those tears the rays of
the sun were beauteously refracted, and his
cheeks glowed with the purple hue of the
heavens.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the harmonious murmur of a distant
waterfall soothed his ear, and upon the
hills, which were covered with cattle, the rural
pipes of the merry shepherds gave life to the
enchanting scene.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Rinaldo, sighing, "that I were
still among the shepherds, as once in my father's
farm! Oh, that I could, in gay and happy

<!-- page 194 -->

innocence, like these peasants, mingle the sound
of my pipe with the enchanting breath of the
zephyrs! What if I were to go to some distant
country, and, resuming my shepherd's crook,
conceal myself in the solitudes of a Spanish
sheepwalk? Oh, that I could again partake of
this happiness! What still detains me in the
vortex of the world, where, surrounded by dangers,
I shall certainly one day become a public
sacrifice to justice? Yes, I will leave these
Sicilian vales, and exchange them for the steepy
mountains of Spain." (Here he burst into a
flood of tears.) "Alas! unhappy that I am:"
continued he, with a deep sigh, and again paused;
but a hermit, who was then ascending the
hill, accosted him in a friendly manner saying:
"You are unhappy, you say! whence is your
unhappiness? Does it arise from your own fault
or that of others?"</p>

<p>"From both," implied Rinaldo, with a half
suppressed sigh.</p>

<p>"Learn then to suffer," continued he, "for
that is the lot of humanity. Heaven has various
ways, and can point out to you a smooth
and pleasant road, except when it is better for
you to walk in rugged paths. Remember all
that happens is for the best."</p>

<p>"Do you receive alms?" said Rinaldo suddenly.</p>

<p>"To give away," replied the hermit. "For
myself I have enough, as I want but little. But
some men there are who have not even that
little."</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>"There are," said Rinaldo, putting a purse
into his hand. He then immediately descended
a hill, and returned home.</p>

<p>Here the marquis informed him he was about
to take a journey of two days, and recommended
him in the meanwhile to the care and attentions
of his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>Rinaldo also received two invitations, which,
however, he refused, that he might be able to
pursue his own reflections.</p>

<p>The day after the marquis's departure he
went out into the fields to his favourite spot.
Night now began to throw her mantle over the
valley, and the rays of the setting sun painted
the mountain tops with purple, till they disappeared
in twilight, while the evening breeze
wafted balsamic odours across the plains. The
flies buzzed and swarmed around, and the distant
shepherds' pipes mingled with the tinkling
bells of the lowing herd, while the languishing
tones of the love-warbling nightingale filled the
air with melody, and every branch became
vocal to the breeze.</p>

<p>Rinaldo stopped at the garden door of a
beautiful villa, and finding it open, went in.
Here the sweets of the orange grove were
wafted towards him, and a chorus of feathered
songsters greeted him from branches crowded
with blossoms, as he approached the house,
which stood in the middle of the garden. Here
he met a girl lightly clothed, and inquired of her,</p>

<p>"To whom does this beautiful villa belong?"</p>

<p>"To the countess Martagno," replied she.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>He was struck with this intelligence but remained
silent. The girl however, still looked
at him, expecting a second question, which Rinaldo
observing, asked,</p>

<p>"Is the countess here?"</p>

<p>"She came this morning," replied the girl;
who then went down the avenue.</p>

<p>Rinaldo had not yet determined whether to
go or stay, when he perceived a female figure
moving in an orange grove; nor had he resolved
whether to proceed or return, when the lady
came out of the grove and called to him:</p>

<p>"Chevalier, can I believe my eyes? Is it
yourself or your apparition?"</p>

<p>It was the countess who thus addressed him;
and it was now too late to recede. Rinaldo
advanced toward her with a silent bow.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake!" continued the countess,
"how did you find my villa?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As men often find many other
things&mdash;by chance.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. You might, however, have been
more gallant than to tell me I am indebted only
to fortune for this pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The debt would be but small.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. At least equal to the chance you
mention.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then we are quits.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. If you wish it, we are; but, when I
reflect, we are not; for the same chance had
only to conduct you a few steps farther to have
transferred the debt to Laura, whose villa is
near mine, and she is now there; or, perhaps,

<!-- page 197 -->

you have mistaken the house, and are too gallant
to acknowledge it? I will send a servant to
show it you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you wish to send me away&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I would willingly keep what Fortune
has thrown in my way, but not at another's cost.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yet you must do that if you would
receive me from the hands of chance.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. If chance and Laura are not the
same, let it be called by any other name, and
you are welcome.</p>

<p>As she said this, she gave him her hand, and
conducted him into an arbour, where a guitar and
a book lay upon a table. Here they seated themselves,
and after a long pause the countess said,
with the utmost simplicity,</p>

<p>"What were we speaking of?"</p>

<p>"Of the beauties of the evening," said Rinaldo,
smiling; upon which the countess burst into
a laugh.</p>

<p>The conversation, however, still halted, and
they arose, took a turn in the garden, talked of
indifferent subjects, and at length approached
a pavilion, which became the scene of a very interesting
interview.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I rejoice much to see you here so
unexpectedly, especially as you are the only person
who could chase away the low spirits with
which I am oppressed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thank you for this compliment.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. 'Tis the truth.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then I am infinitely obliged to the truth.
But may I ask what causes you these low spirits?</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p><i>Countess</i>. I will tell you. One man I cannot
bear wants to force himself upon me, while my
family want to force upon me another.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And you would not marry again?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. At least neither of these men.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then choose a third who neither
forces himself upon you or is forced upon you by
your family, provided you do not dislike him.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I would either have a man who
gives himself to me or none.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That depends on you.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. The accepting him may, but not the
giving.</p>

<p>As she said this she stretched out her hand,
which sank upon Rinaldo's; upon which she
suddenly withdrew it; but Rinaldo instantly
seized it, and softly pressing it, felt his own pressed
in return by that of the countess.</p>

<p>A loud conversation in the avenue leading to the
pavilion at length awakened the lovers from the
dream of bliss, and starting up they perceived
Laura and some other ladies enter the pavilion.</p>

<p>The countess received her friends with evident
marks of embarrassment; nor did any connected
conversation take place till the ladies inquired for
their carriage and took their leave.</p>

<p>As Rinaldo handed them in, Laura whispered
to him, "I congratulate you;" and the countess
said aloud, "I shall see you again to-morrow,
chevalier." To which he assented with a compliment.
The carriage drove off and Rinaldo
returned home, musing on what had passed.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN OF BANDITTI.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>BOOK V.</h3>

</div>

<p>RINALDO repeated his visits to the countess so
frequently both in town and country, that Laura
had no longer a place in his heart. Meanwhile
the Marquis returned from his excursion, and
spoke much of the old man of Fronteja, to
whom he promised to introduce him.</p>

<p>Upon Rinaldo's inquiring who this old man
was, the marquis replied, "He is, perhaps, the
wisest man of the age: a philosopher who is
deeply versed in the most secret of the mysteries
called <i>krata repoa</i>, and has unfolded things
of which nothing certain has yet been known."</p>

<p>"But I do not perceive," said Rinaldo, "of
what use his acquaintance can be to me, as I
have no desire to be initiated into the mysteries
of krata repoa, for which I have neither genius
nor inclination."</p>

<p>"The grand object for which we have united,"
replied the marquis, "requires a knowledge
of it."</p>

<!-- page 4 -->

<p>Rinaldo was silent, and the marquis pursued
the subject no farther.</p>

<p>The whole family were invited to pass the
evening at the countess's villa; but Rinaldo was
the first who arrived there. The company
were regaled in the pavilion, where every one
was very gay and happy, after which they adjourned
to some benches on a grass-plot in front
of it, where they were about to amuse themselves
with games, when two servants with flambeaux
introduced a stranger, who, they said, wished
to speak with the marquis.</p>

<p>The marquis arose, and the stranger approached;
but the instant he perceived Rinaldo
he put his hand to his sword and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Ha, assassin! have I found you?"</p>

<p>"Who dares insult me?" said Rinaldo; and,
drawing his sword, perceived his antagonist was
the captain.</p>

<p>"I dare!" said the latter, gnashing his teeth.</p>

<p>They now instantly engaged; but a shot from
the grove wounded the captain, and he fell.</p>

<p>The confusion was now general, every one
was in motion, some screaming and lamenting
and some running to and fro, while the servants
came in armed, and increased the uproar.</p>

<p>The countess, however, had the presence of
mind to pull the chevalier into the pavilion,
which was now vacant, and shutting the door
upon him, locked him in.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, who knew not how all this had
come to pass continued alone there during two

<!-- page 5 -->

hours, in anxious expectation, and greatly wondered
how the affair would end.</p>

<p>At length the door opened and the countess
entered.</p>

<p>"Is the captain dead?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"He lies dangerously wounded in the house,"
replied the countess. "But without inquiring,"
continued she, "any further into these strange
events, my only care at present is to save you.
Far in the mountain of Ramata I have a castle,
where no one will find, or even look for
you. Thither you must instantly fly. Here is
a letter to the warder, in which I have described
you as baron Tegnano, and a relation of
mine. A horse is ready saddled for you at the
garden gate. Adieu! You shall hear from me
shortly, and as soon as possible I will come
myself."</p>

<p>Having said this she embraced him, and
moistened his cheeks with tears. At length
she tore herself from his arms, and conducted
him to the garden gate, where Rinaldo mounted
and took his uncertain way, according to her
directions, toward the country.</p>

<p>The night was beautiful, the full moon illuminated
all the hills, and a solemn stillness reigned
throughout the air; but upon an eminence
he beheld a human figure, which seemed to be
in motion. Rinaldo stopped his horse and observing
the figure, perceived that it approached him.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"One who knew you," replied a voice from

<!-- page 6 -->

the eminence, "when you were count Mandochini.
I know another name for you, however,
which I would not entrust even to the silence of
the night."</p>

<p>"If you know me," said Rinaldo, "tell me
your name."</p>

<p>"Do you not know my voice? I am your servant
Ludovico."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ludovico! Yes, now I know you.
How came you here?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Why not here as well as elsewhere?
I had almost done for the captain in
Calabria. But he that is born to be hanged
will never be drowned, and the rascal got well
of his wounds. I took ship in Calabria as a
travelling gun-smith and came to Messina,
where I saw you twice, but in such great company
that I could not speak to you. What
name you went by I did not know, and could
not ask you. My money, however, began to
fail, and I knew not what to do. But as I was
walking, much dejected, on the port, I again
beheld this accursed captain. I should as soon
have expected to see the devil. Thunder and
lightning, thought I, is the rascal yet alive?
Could I but find my captain! So I kept lurking
about, but could not find you any where. At
length I saw you going to the villa, followed
you, got acquainted with the servants, pretended
to be a travelling fencing master, learnt on
whose premises I was, reflected a little, and
observing that an entertainment was to be given
at the villa, I thought it would furnish me with

<!-- page 7 -->

an opportunity of speaking to my captain.
Thus I slipped into the garden, and stationed
myself in a grove, where I soon perceived that
villain the Corsican. I listened to what passed,
heard every word, and saw you draw, and instantly
I laid the rascal upon the ground. Yes,
I have done for him I hope. If he is not dead
by this time 'tis not my fault. When I quitted
the garden I concealed myself behind an aloe,
and after a while saw a horse brought there
ready saddled. The thought immediately struck
me, that it was for my captain, and so it turned
out. I saw you mount, followed you, and here
I am ready to attend you wherever you go, if
you will permit me. If not, give me a couple
of ducats, and send me to the devil.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Come with me my brave fellow, and
in the next village you shall be mounted.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Many thanks. Oh that it were day-light.
I am as hungry as a wolf. But now there
are two of us we shall travel better. I have a
couple of pocket pistols, and before the enemy
kill you they must dispatch me.</p>

<p>Thus Ludovico accompanied his captain, and
at break of day they entered a village where they
stopped, and having breakfasted, Rinaldo bought
a mule for Ludovico and again set off.</p>

<p>On the sixth day they arrived, without further
adventures and perils, at the place of their
destination.</p>

<p>The castle stood on the mountain, under an
eminence surrounded by walls and fosses, provided
with drawbridges, and strongly fortified.

<!-- page 8 -->

The warder was an old man, somewhat petulant,
but of a good heart, and formerly steward to the
countess's father. When he had read the letter
he said dryly, "According to the directions
of the countess the whole castle is at your command."</p>

<p>Ludovico now led the beasts to the stable,
and Rinaldo took possession of a couple of neat
rooms, in which was some very antique furniture.</p>

<p>The family consisted of the warder, his wife,
his daughter, a maid servant, and an old invalid,
who had formerly served under the countess's
father in Spain, and who here subsisted as a
pensioner of the countess.</p>

<p>As to the provisions the castle afforded, appearances
were but very moderate, and Rinaldo
began to make preparations for some addition
in this respect. Ludovico, Giorgio the invalid,
and the maid were sent out, and soon brought
an ass loaded with provisions, which stocked the
kitchen and store room. The court-yard was
also filled with fowl, and the wine cellar with
wine, of which the warder delivered the keys to
Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Thus in a short time the castle became more
gay and lively, and the once dull and stupid inhabitants
now grew active, cheerful, and happy.</p>

<p>Rinaldo amused himself sometimes with sitting
on the old fortifications and viewing the
surrounding country, sometimes with walking
over the mountains, sometimes with reading a
couple of old chronicles, and sometimes with

<!-- page 9 -->

hearing the warder relate the adventures of
the place, and Giorgio give an account of his
campaigns.</p>

<p>Once they were sitting together, and had lost
themselves amid adventures and marvellous stories,
when the warder exclaimed, "Ah, my dear
Baron! there are many such stories current of
this neighbourhood, and not only of the neighbourhood,
but also of our castle itself."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Of the castle where we are now?</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Of this very castle.</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Yes, yes, of this very castle.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed! but what, for instance?
Spectres?</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Yes, and the like.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. The great hall where the large padlocks
hang on the door, is haunted.</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Yes, that is the place.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. What for, rats and mice?</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Hush! hush! 'Tis no trifle I assure
you. Quite other things than rats and mice.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Have you seen any thing?</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Not I; I have heard enough. But
there is Lisberta, the warder's daughter, who
has seen a great deal.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Lisberta!</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Yes, I myself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What did you see?</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Last year the countess intended to
come here, but did not come. However, we
cleaned the castle, and prepared for her reception.
I was to sweep out the great hall, from
which a stair case that is shut up goes I know

<!-- page 10 -->

not whither, and the lower door is constantly
fastened from within, but how, my father knows
not.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Yes, constantly. Since I have been
here, however, no one has taken the trouble to
look farther into it, for no one comes near us,
except that the countess once staid here three
days.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Well, Lisberta?</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Well, and so when I had swept the
hall, and was standing quite still, cleaning the
lustres in the window, I heard footsteps, and
thinking it was my father, I took no particular
notice. But as it came nearer, I turned round,
and saw in the door, going up stairs, a great,
long, haggard figure, with a beard. I know nothing
more, for I sank senseless upon the floor
and when I recovered myself, it had disappeared.
But it is certainly true, and I can take my
sacrament oath of it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By heavens 'tis wonderful!</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Is it not strange?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As we have plenty of time on our
hands, we will examine the place to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Well, don't take me with you, for I
shall be of no service.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ludovico and I will do it, and Giorgio
will no doubt be willing to accompany us,
for he is an old soldier.</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. With all my heart I will soon
finish the campaign.</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Oh, sir, do not attempt to look into
it! It can never be found out how it is.</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Be not uneasy. I know a little of
exorcism.</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. If you are but sure of what you are
about, and that it will not turn out as with brother
Boniface, the capuchin, who thought he understood
exorcism too, but the ghost thrashed him
within an inch of his life.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. It must have been a vigorous ghost.</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Yes, certainly; the good friar has
been bedridden these four years; but he is still
alive and you may ask him about it.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Well, we are not afraid of being
thrashed: we have fists too, and can hit as hard
a blow as a ghost.</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Heaven grant it may not come to
that!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You will attend me, however, if I
come back with a good beating?</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. O yes, with all my heart. But you
and Ludovico may perhaps catch a pistol ball.
And how will Giorgio look when his bones are
all broken?</p>

<p><i>Giorgio</i>. Don't be wondrous wise, miss; my
bones are as good as ever. Were it not for the
wound I received in my hip at Barcelona, I
would run a race with you. Yes, I have a constitution
as hard as iron; but the wound at Barcelona
and that in my right shoulder at Bellegarde&mdash;of
that I was badly cured, and when the
weather changes I feel it most cursedly. But as
to the ghost hunting expedition I am your man.
I will take my sabre.</p>

<p><i>Lisberta</i>. Of what use can it be? I will give

<!-- page 12 -->

you a church candle, and that will do much better.
I got it at the last pilgrimage.</p>

<p>After this conversation Rinaldo undertook to
perform the search, which he did on the following
day, when the great padlocks on the hall-door
were unlocked, the bolts drawn, and the
door opened, upon which a couple of rats flew at
the warder's head, who instantly fell down in a
swoon. The rats were killed and the windows
opened; but the warder left the party to themselves.
Lisberta lighted three candles and recommended
the adventurers to the Holy Virgin,
St. Anthony, and St. Marciana, and went away,
assuring them at the same time she would pray
most devoutly for them all.</p>

<p>The hall was a large square apartment hung
with old tapestry, and a couple of family pictures,
but contained no other furniture.</p>

<p>They opened the door leading to the stairs,
and descended thirty-six steps till they came to a
door which, as has been said, was fastened from
within. This door appeared very old and rotten,
and was easily broken with an iron crow, but
the bolts from within did not move. The vaulted
roof gave back the sound, and our adventurers
creeping through the fracture, entered an arched
way somewhat higher than a man, and about
half as broad.</p>

<p>They had proceeded about twenty paces,
when they came to some steps, which they descended,
and a little further found more steps,
beyond which the road was somewhat shelving
downward, and led to an arched circular room,

<!-- page 13 -->

and the door out of which was likewise bolted
from without.</p>

<p>"This," said Rinaldo, "is a subterraneous passage,
intended for an escape in time of war; but
what surprises me is, that all the doors are bolted
from without."</p>

<p>They were about to break the door open, when
they clearly and distinctly heard a cry of "wo!
wo! wo!" at which Giorgio was so alarmed
that he trembled all over, and his teeth chattered.
Rinaldo therefore ordered Ludovico to take the
coward back to day-light, where, on their arrival
in the great hall, Giorgio was seized with convulsions.
Ludovico therefore alarmed the castle,
and Giorgio was carried to bed, where Ludovico
bled him. The warder's wife also administered
some stomachic drops to her patient, who seemed
in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>The warder, who had not yet recovered from
the fright he had himself experienced, crawled
to him, and began sometimes to curse and sometimes
to pray, while Lisberta and her mother
with a trembling voice sang a hymn, and Ludovico
emptied half a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo did not stay long at the
door where he heard the cry, but knocking at it,
called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is there? open the door, or I will
force it."</p>

<p>A voice replied, by asking, "Who thus disturbs
the inhabitants of the bowels of the
earth?"</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"One who would be acquainted with them,"
said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"We desire not to see him," replied the
voice.</p>

<p>Rinaldo repeated his threat, "Open, or I will
force the door."</p>

<p>"If you can bear," said the voice, "to behold
that which is buried beneath the earth, procure
the keys of this door from the Count Martagno."</p>

<p>"The count of Martagno," said Rinaldo, "can
give me no keys. He is no more."</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked the voice hastily.</p>

<p>"He died two years ago," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Here followed a pause, which continued till
Rinaldo applied the crow and forced the door.</p>

<p>He now entered a dark vault, whence a tall
figure suddenly glided away; Rinaldo hastened
after it, but it shut an iron door behind it with
a loud noise. Rinaldo threw himself on a
bench, his candle went out, and he heard from
the corner of the room a female voice saying
with a melancholy tone, "Just heaven terminate
my days!"</p>

<p>This deeply affected Rinaldo, who started up
and asked with trembling voice, "who speaks?"</p>

<p>"If I may call you my deliverer," replied
the voice, "know that the most wretched of
human beings implores your pity. Ah! even
were you the cruel Count Martagno himself
could you behold my misery, you would release
me from this dungeon, and restore me to the

<!-- page 15 -->

light of day, of which I have so long been deprived."</p>

<p>"Count Martagno is dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead! God be praised! Then are my sorrows
past."</p>

<p>"And I will save you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo heard footsteps, and some one calling
him by name from a distance. He answered,
and found it was Ludovico, who came very opportunely
with a lighted candle. Rinaldo
searched for his candle, lighted it, ordered Ludovico
to be silent, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou that just now conversed with me,
where art thou?"</p>

<p>"Here," said the voice from a round hole in
the wall about four feet from the ground;
"here am I, immersed in a narrow dungeon, and
have no opening but this hole, through which I
receive my miserable subsistence."</p>

<p>Rinaldo held the light and saw a pale haggard
countenance with hollow eyes before the
opening. This sight-pierced him to the heart,
and almost paralyzed Ludovico himself.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the prisoner with a deep
sigh, and hurried back, "these eyes could never
bear the sight of day-light."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now reflected for a moment, and to
secure himself a retreat, examined the iron
door which the figure had shut behind her, and
sent Ludovico back for some tools and large
padlocks, for he found a number of bars and
fastenings hanging beside the door. Meanwhile

<!-- page 16 -->

he strictly enjoined Ludovico to keep silence
relative to what he had seen.</p>

<p>When Ludovico was gone, Rinaldo asked the
prisoner, "Have you seen no light here?"</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>. Sometimes a dim burning lamp
when my straw or my bread and water were
brought me&mdash;but no other light.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then accustom your eyes from time
to time to this candle, and by degrees you will
be enabled to bear the day-light.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>. Will you release me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>. Almighty God! I thank thee. Oh
reward my deliverer for his benevolence!</p>

<p>Rinaldo leaned against the wall, and sighing,
exclaimed, "Oh God! teach me to pray devoutly,
as once I prayed in the days of my youthful
innocence!"</p>

<p>When Ludovico returned he brought not only
the padlock and tools, but a bottle of wine, some
fruit, and some pastry for the unhappy, unknown,
and pale faced stranger, as he expressed
himself.</p>

<p>"You have done extremely well, Ludovico,"
said Rinaldo, and gave the prisoner what was
brought for her. She received it with the
warmest gratitude, and while she was eating;
her deliverer barred the iron door and padlocked
it: he then set to work with a pick-axe
and crow, and widened the hole so that the prisoner
might pass, who had no sooner quitted
her dungeon than she fell down on her knees
and prayed.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>Heavens! what a sight! Haggard, pale, and
meagre, almost reduced to a skeleton, with
scarcely clothes to cover her, she tottered
forth, leaning on Rinaldo, along the subterraneous
passage, and as she reached the hall, covered
her face with her hand. Unaccustomed
to the air, she sank upon the earth. Rinaldo
led her to a room, where he laid her upon a
bed. She fell into a deep sleep, and Rinaldo
locked the door.</p>

<p>When it was done he sent Ludovico to the
nearest town to buy some women's clothes, and,
meanwhile, with the assistance of the warder,
fixed another door to the stairs, which having
fastened up, he took him to the chamber where
the liberated prisoner lay, held his hand to
his mouth, led him out again, and locked the
door.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Heavens! What have I seen?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The secrets of the bowels of the
earth. You are a man of understanding, warder.
What you have seen you must conceal until I
find a proper opportunity to publish the whole.
This perhaps concerns the honour of the countess
and her family.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Baron, I am a man, and can keep
silence.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you do not I will set something
at you far worse than rats.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Silence about the rats. I am quite
ashamed of that story. However, I am a little
consoled by seeing that Giorgio is not so great
a hero as he pretends.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How is he?</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Better. He says he heard and saw
dreadful things.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The fool! He saw nothing. 'Twas
but an owl that screamed, and he fell down in a
swoon.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. An owl! Oh, heavens! what a
coward!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Hush! hush! Remember the rats.</p>

<p><i>Warder</i>. Well, well, we are neither of us
any great matters in point of courage. But,
what I was going to ask, Oh! Who is this
skeleton of a woman?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Silence! Not a word on that subject.
We will talk of it to-morrow.</p>

<p>Ludovico now brought clothes, which were
given to the stranger, who was also supplied
with food, and shut up in a chamber, where
she slept a day and a half almost without intermission,
which very much contributed to her
recovery. Giorgio and the warder were much
rallied by Ludovico for their cowardice, and the
latter was besides tormented with curiosity on
account of the secret of which he knew nothing
more than came out by Ludovico's raillery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo and Ludovico went in
search of further discoveries in the subterraneous
passages. They had loosened the
padlocks and bars from the iron door, and after
endeavouring in vain to open it, were resting
for a short time from their labours, when they
heard footsteps from without. Presently the
bolt was drawn back, the door creaked upon

<!-- page 19 -->

its hinges, and a figure came half in sight, when
Rinaldo sprang up and thundered out, "Halt!"</p>

<p>The figure instantly disappeared, knowing
the ground better than Rinaldo and Ludovico,
who pursued it. They now stumbled through
a small arched way till they came to a flight of
stone steps leading upward, and ending at an
iron trap door. They ascended them and
entered a tower with a winding stair-case.
Having also ascended these, they came out on
the battlements of the tower, and perceived
that it stood entirely alone on the farthest peak
of the mountain, where the castle was situated.</p>

<p>The tower had no entrance, and they could not
comprehend whither the figure had gone, unless
a rope ladder had been prepared for his
escape.</p>

<p>As they could make no further discoveries,
they turned back, examined the trap door,
found it very thick and strong, and well furnished
with bolts from within, which they bolted
and padlocked strongly. In like manner they
locked the iron door from within, and returned
through the hall into the castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lady having rested two days
had considerably recovered; and Rinaldo, who
was anxious to know whom he had thus rescued
from her subterraneous dungeon, now began
to make inquiries of her, to which she replied
as follows:</p>

<p>"I feel it my duty," said she, "to give my
deliverer a true account of my misfortunes, and
this I will perform to the utmost of my power.

<!-- page 20 -->

My name is Violanta, daughter of one Brotezza
di Noli, formerly a vassal of Count Martagno,
who had recently lost his first wife when I had
the misfortune to become acquainted with him.
He declared he loved me, but I believed him
not. He swore however his views were honourable,
and solicited my hand in marriage. I
referred him to my father, for I had lost my
mother in my infancy. My father was then
fighting in Spain under the banners of his lord,
and fell at the siege of Barcelona. Poor and
destitute I sought refuge with an old woman,
who assisted me in making up a dower with
which I might be received into a convent.
Having at length succeeded in this, I set off to
put my plan in execution, but was surprised on
the road, bound, and carried off, I know not
whither. 'Twas into the hands of Count Martagno's
people that I fell, and they brought me
to this castle, where the count again repeated
his profession of love. I rejected every dishonourable
proposal with firmness and disdain,
and declared I would rather die than resign my
virtue. The count endeavoured to obtain what
I refused, by art and force, but all was in vain.
To misuse me was in his power, but not to
make me yield to his wicked passion; and I
told him nothing but marriage should ever procure
him what he asked. Thus finding it impossible
to undermine my virtue, he resolved
to obtain me by that means, and the priest united
us in the bonds of wedlock."</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>"What!" interrupted Rinaldo, "were you
then married to Count Martagno?"</p>

<p>"I was," continued Violanta, "to my misfortune.
He lived here with me somewhat more
than a quarter of a year, and then he set off
on a journey, from which he never returned,
but (God knows why!) had me conveyed to
yonder prison, where you found me. To my
complaints, I received no answer, and the world
heard not of my sorrows. An old knave gave
me bread and water, and daily grumbled, saying,
will you live for ever?"</p>

<p>"Just heaven!" exclaimed Rinaldo, "while
you lay in a dungeon the count was again married
at Messina. His widow is still living, and
certainly has not the slightest suspicion of this
villainous transaction."</p>

<p>Their conversation was now interrupted by
a noise in the castle, and Rinaldo springing up
and going to the window, saw a carriage drive
up, in which was the countess.</p>

<p>Rinaldo hastened to meet her, and when
they were alone she told him the Marquis Romano
had received the captain into his house,
and hopes were entertained of his recovery.
"As to you, chevalier," continued she, " 'tis believed
you have embarked and left Sicily.
Meanwhile I have taken the opportunity of the
nobility leaving Messina and going to their estates,
to come and see you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo thanked her warmly for her kindness,
and for her care of his safety, and waited

<!-- page 22 -->

a proper time for declaring the discoveries he
had made, and the story of Violanta.</p>

<p>The countess was extremely shocked at the
tale, and desired to see Violanta, from whose
mouth she again heard the story, promised her
protection and assistance, and told her she
would consider her as a sister.</p>

<p>The castle now became more lively, and the
inquisitive warder, after certain hints and partial
explanations, made no further inquiries.
Violanta passed for a companion of the countess,
and no one knew how she had come to the
castle.</p>

<p>One fine summer evening, as Rinaldo and the
countess were sitting in a balcony of the castle,
hand in hand, both partly lost in thought, and
without much conversation, the countess at
length said:</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Sooner or later, my dear friend,
we must come to an explanation. Why should
we postpone it, and cause ourselves so many
melancholy and tedious hours? Let it then be
now? Tell me, sincerely, what are your future
plans?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To do that which I must do; to
leave Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Alone?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who should accompany me except
my Ludovico?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. And no one else?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No one. He will never desert me.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. No one else? Chevalier, will you
really travel alone?</p>

<!-- page 23 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah, countess! it must be so.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. It must be so? Have you then
connexions elsewhere that&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Unfortunate connexions.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Have you a wife?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, neither wife nor child, neither
father nor mother, nor a country that owns me.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Have you then been banished and
proscribed?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Every where.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Every where? How is that possible?
Explain yourself. Are you not the cavalier
della Cintra?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am not.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. What then is your name?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That you must permit me to conceal.
When I am gone you shall know whom
you have honoured with your friendship and
your love.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. You make me melancholy. The
Marquis Romano gave it out that he knew you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Trust not the marquis or his friends.
They would have done me a dreadful injury.
Now I see through it all. I have escaped this
time&mdash;but who knows&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Mysterious man! speak out.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I dare not.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. How? I have given you my heart,
given myself up to you, given you all that was
dear to me, and can you keep secrets from me?
I will declare still more to you than you already
know. I am ready to go with you wherever
you would go yourself.</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis impossible! you cannot go with
me.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I offer you my hand.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Unfortunate woman! Your hand
belongs to some more honourable man.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. It belongs to the father of my child,
which I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Almighty God! what sayest thou?
Then be a mother, and give your own name
to your child. Mine he cannot bear with
honour.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Great heavens! Who art thou?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am&mdash;Oh heavens, I must not tell
you.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Be you who you may, I must know.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. When you lay in my arms you were
in the arms of the abomination of all Italy.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Oh, heavens!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am&mdash;I am Rinaldini.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Jesu Maria!</p>

<p>The countess fell from her seat and swooned.
Rinaldo carried her into her chamber. Early
the next day he asked to speak with her, but
she was still asleep. Soon after a note from
her was brought to him, sealed up, to the following
effect:</p>

<p class="small">"Unfortunate man! you have rendered me
inexpressibly miserable. I cannot see you more;
leave me to my fate, and pursue yours."</p>

<p>Rinaldo ordered his horse and mule to be
saddled, and setting off with Ludovico, took
leave of the castle.</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>They conversed very little on the road, and
travelled two days without entering into any
connected discourse. Ludovico, indeed, endeavoured
to turn the attention of Rinaldo to
various subjects, but Rinaldo was wholly averse
to talk of them, and continued pensive and
silent.</p>

<p>On the third day they set off from a miserable
little inn at day break, in order before
night to get beyond a pass over a chain of
mountains, which had been described to them
as extremely dangerous; and here Rinaldo himself
experienced that anxiety so often felt by
travellers when exposed to the attacks of such
robbers as he had once commanded.</p>

<p>They reached the pass by noon, and had
scarcely advanced a hundred paces before they
heard a distant noise and outcry, together with
the report of fire arms.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Rinaldo to Ludovico, "here
is danger. Let us hasten thither. Perhaps
we shall be obliged to become enemies to some
of our old companions."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ludovico, "with all my heart!
I will fight my man."</p>

<p>Thus saying they set forward and soon discovered
a carriage stopped by six or eight robbers,
who were taking off the mules.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Rinaldo, while yet at some
distance, and at the same time drew out his pistol.
Immediately a shot fell near him, but
missed. Ludovico stood up in his stirrups and
fired his musket. One of the robbers fell; and

<!-- page 26 -->

a second fired at Rinaldo; but the latter rushing
among them with his sabre, the rest fled to
the woods.</p>

<p>"These cannot be any of our comrades,"
said Ludovico.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now advanced to the carriage, while
Ludovico helped the coachman, who lay wounded
by some of his party who were killed, to get
upon his legs, and looking in perceived the
Baron Denongo and his daughter, the beautiful
Laura.</p>

<p>"Chevalier!"&mdash;exclaimed she, the instant
she saw him&mdash;and the baron said, "Sir, I am
under the greatest obligations to you. Were
it not for your courageous assistance, we had
been robbed, and perhaps maltreated in the
most dreadful manner."</p>

<p>"No compliments!" replied Rinaldo, "a man
of honour, like you, would doubtless, in the like
case, have equally served me. I will, however,
do more, I and my servant will escort you; for
I perceive some of your attendants are killed,
and others wounded."</p>

<p>"Chevalier," replied the baron, "your generosity
has anticipated a request I was about to
make. I have about six leagues to go to my
castle, and, as you have observed, have lost
some of my attendants. An old man like myself
is glad to avail himself of the protection of
a young man of honour like you, and I may venture
to say, I have in some measure deserved
this kindness, since in my youth I rendered

<!-- page 27 -->

others such services as you are now conferring
on me."</p>

<p>While these and a few more compliments
were passing between the baron and Rinaldo,
during which Laura continued silent, Ludovico
bound up the coachman's wounds as well as he
was able, and helped him on the coachbox.
He also put the mules to the carriage, and
every thing being in readiness they set off, Rinaldo
riding by the side of the carriage.</p>

<p>In five hours they arrived at the Baron's
castle, where the baron thus addressed him:
"Chevalier," said he, "it is now my turn not
only to show you my politeness, but, as you have
saved my life, to request the favour of your taking
your abode at my house."</p>

<p>To this Rinaldo scarcely knew what to reply,
when Laura added, "You must not refuse us,
chevalier."</p>

<p>Upon this he sprang off his horse, and accepted
the invitation, which was also very grateful
to Ludovico.</p>

<p>"Chevalier," said Ludovico, "we have again
fallen into kind and tender hands. Here we
shall be well."</p>

<p>"We shall not stay long," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Aha!" returned Ludovico, "had I money
I would bet we should not go very soon."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you would lose.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Lose what? Not my money. I
know you better. Such a pair of eyes will not
soon suffer you to depart. However, I cannot

<!-- page 28 -->

blame you. In your place I should do the
same.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This time, however, you are deceived.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. You will deceive yourself first.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Not unless I am first deceived.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That too may come to pass, nor
will I contradict you, provided it be by a woman.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed! Then you think&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That I would not trust one of
them, let them appear as honourable as they
may.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where did you learn this philosophy?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. In the world where I have lived,
and moved, and heard, and seen a great deal.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Unload our baggage and take it to
the chamber appointed for my reception.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Well, all is for the best. But now
you must go to the old man, and, to his daughter.</p>

<p>The old man was a worthy, hearty old man,
much advanced in years, and though tormented
with many bodily pains, by no means morose.
He was liberal, chatty, and good natured. Ludovico's
courage he easily found means to reward,
by giving him a purse of ducats; but as
to his guest, whom he only knew as the chevalier
della Cintra, he could not discover any
mode of requiting his services without wounding
his delicacy. He consulted, therefore, with
his daughter, but she was equally unable to

<!-- page 29 -->

point out a way of discharging this important
obligation.</p>

<p>Rinaldo did not live so free from care with
the baron as in the castle of the countess. Many
reflections on his present situation and future
prospects intruded on his mind, and others suggested
many motives for shortening his stay.</p>

<p>Having given Laura a hint of this, she replied:
"At Messina we all imagined you had left the
island after that bloody affray, but now I perceive
you were in no hurry to quit it. Why
then should your visit to my father seem so tedious
and unpleasing?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That would be impossible.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Perhaps a desire to be elsewhere, in
company with some one who interests you more
than my father.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. (<i>smiling</i>) What a good old man!</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. (<i>carelessly</i>) That he certainly is.
His great concern is, that he knows not how to
compensate the man who has saved his life. As
for me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You would know better?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I would give you something. But
more I cannot do.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And this present?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I have not yet determined what.
You must give me time to think of it. But if
the loadstone that drew you hither&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you call my unhappy fate a
loadstone?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Your unhappy fate? I knew nothing
of it.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis better it should be known to me
alone. It drives me hence, and would expel me
from paradise itself.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Have you quarrelled with the countess
Martagno?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Why do you talk of the countess?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Do not pretend ignorance. I know
what I say. Perhaps you have lost your way?
The countess has several estates and castles, and
is now in the country.</p>

<p>Here they were interrupted by the baron,
who entered the room with a letter in his hand,
saying, "Here is a singular piece of intelligence
from Messina. 'Tis there positively asserted
that the celebrated Rinaldini is not dead, but
actually in the island. Perhaps the robbers from
whom this brave knight has rescued us were
some of his people. It would be very unfortunate
should this unwelcome guest take up his
quarters in our valley. I will arm my people,
for he sometimes attacks castles, and even fortified
places.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," said Rinaldo, "that Rinaldo
can be in Sicily. Were it so, we should
certainly have heard something of him; for he
cannot remain long inactive."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the baron, "for he lives
by exciting a constant agitation and alarm."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Surely, by and in constant agitation
and alarm.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Even in Messina the greatest fear
prevails. 'Tis said the viceroy will order out

<!-- page 31 -->

the militia, and set a price upon the head of this
king of robbers.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I cannot reckon much upon the
price. For when I fell into his hands he behaved
very honourable to me, and made me
promise not to use any artifice or stratagem
against him; and in open field I would by no
means contend with him.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. In fact, I am alarmed for the purses
of our nobility, and for my own. I myself am
old and feeble, and what are only twelve men,
whom I have in the castle, against such a desperado?
Chevalier, you must do me the favour
to stay sometime longer with us. You are a
man of courage and resolution, and your Ludovico
is a fine desperate fellow too. Yes, indeed,
were he not in your service I could almost
imagine him one of Rinaldini's band.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He seems bold enough. But I don't
think we have any thing to fear from him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the baron's steward now returned
from the neighbouring town, where he had
been to transact some business, and having given
an account of his various commissions, he added,
that several travellers had been attacked and
plundered by robbers on the road in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>"Ay, that is what I feared," said the baron;
"the storm comes nearer and nearer."</p>

<p>The steward now quitted the room, and the
baron continued to expatiate upon his cares and
fears. Rinaldo endeavoured in vain to banish
them; and Laura, who feared Rinaldo would

<!-- page 32 -->

still persist in his intentions of leaving them,
said,</p>

<p>"The chief duty of a knight is to protect and
defend the ladies. I therefore request of you,
chevalier, not to forget yours, and to stay here
to protect me."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You know, however, that, the protection
of a knight is not wholly disinterested!</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Right, my good chevalier, you will
remind her of that, for otherwise she might
desire it gratis.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I know not how such a service can be
repaid.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The reward depends on your own
will. But paid it must be.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Then let my father pay for me.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. That cannot be. Besides, I am a
debtor also, and must pay for myself.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Well, then I will pay you like some
heroine of romance. Take this ribband&mdash;these
are my colours. Wear it, and let it inflame you
to mighty deeds, and teach you to become worthy
of the present. Behave like a man and a
true knight, and then you shall also gain what I
wear near this ribband&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. How? That must be your heart!</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. No, my dear father, I mean my
portrait.</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended, and Rinaldo
began to struggle with himself, thus reflecting
on his views and plans. "To what end should
I continue in this castle? What advantage can
it bring? It will but form a net in which I shall

<!-- page 33 -->

soon be caught! Why should I delude myself
with false hopes? Laura's hand I can never
obtain. And even had I unfairly stolen her as
a knight, should I not again be torn from her as
a captain of banditti?"</p>

<p>With those reflections he threw himself down
beneath a clump of trees on the bank of a river
that meandered through flowery meadows along
the plains that bounded the mountains. Here
he endeavored to form some resolution, which,
however, he was unable to do; and soothed by
the balmy fragrance of the air, he sank into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke he perceived, a few steps
from him, sitting on a stone beneath a lofty pine,
a man in singular clothing, reading a book. His
blooming, florid countenance seemed at variance
with his white head and beard, which
marked him for an old man. His long and ample
robe was like that of the Pythagoreans, of
sky blue, and girded high up with a belt of a very
fiery red. His arms were covered with the
white sleeves of an under garment, and his feet
had no clothing but the thongs of red leather,
with which his broad sandals were bound.</p>

<p>This singular man strongly attracted Rinaldo's
attention. He contemplated him for a
time in silence, but at length he arose, approached
and accosted him. Upon which the
cheerful old man, first fixing his eyes on him,
said, "How canst thou be so imprudent to
sleep so carelessly in this place where venomous
creatures abound?"</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>"Is there really any danger?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Look behind you," replied the old man with
the most perfect tranquillity.</p>

<p>Rinaldo looked and perceived a dead serpent
in the grass not far from the spot where he had
slept. He started and cast an inquisitive look
toward the old man, who understanding his
meaning, said, "That snake approached you as you
slept."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And is now dead!</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. As you see.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To what good fortune do I owe my
safety.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I passed near you as the serpent
was darting toward you, and, it is dead.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You killed it? But with what weapons?
I perceive you have none.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. There are words which have
twice the force of any weapons.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Words!</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Yes words. I seated myself opposite
to you, that as long as you slept no similar
misfortune might attend you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Accept my best thanks, and permit
me to store your name in my grateful memory.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Names render men neither better
nor more remarkable than they really are. Remember
my figure, and I shall live in your memory
without a name.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You speak the most modem dialect
of the island, and your dress is that of antiquity.
How can this be reconciled?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. In the simplest manner possible.

<!-- page 35 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Once more, who are you?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. That which you may be also if you
will, a friend to wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is wisdom then a universal friend?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. As universal as the sun, and like
him its rays warming every heart that is adapted
to receive them. But to feel this celestial
warmth requires an organization which all men
do not possess. A bad man is not worthy to
know the road to the temple of wisdom; and
that which to the good would be a blessing, to
the bad would prove a curse. To him that has
no smell the fragrance of these flowery vales is
vain: and as each element requires a peculiar
organization in the creature that inhabits it, so
does the temple of wisdom require a certain organization
in him that would enter its sanctuary.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Here great secrets are unfolded.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. The temple of wisdom is the temple
of nature, and in nature nothing is secret.
What men call the secrets of nature are but
the laws which are clearly written in the book
of nature, and that is open to every man. Read
in that book. Read with the eye of the soul,
whose eye is observation. This eye, however,
must be clear, and this clearness is the child of
peace, and of the absence of the passions. 'Tis
but the pure fountain that shows the just reflection
of the all animating sun. Troubled streams
are no mirror. Just so it is with wisdom. Nature
resembles a beautiful woman, who sometimes
carelessly exposes her secret charms and
conceals the rest with the utmost care. He

<!-- page 36 -->

who can think, feel, prove, and observe, is worthy
to behold her without a veil. Nature but
speaks to those who have organs fine enough to
hear her voice. The refinement of the senses
is an approach to the secrets of nature. The
man who approaches her with a pure heart and
clear eyes, she calls her high priest, and welcomes
to her sanctuary. There the veil fails
from his eyes, and all that was before incomprehensible
becomes clear and plain. For all
that is incomprehensible in this sublunary world
lies in assimilation, and this is what the least of
mankind may understand. The loadstone only
acts on its like, and its effluvia are wonderful.
This power is but a trifle; there are secret
powers&mdash;powers of the soul; and their mode of
action is still more wonderful than that of the
loadstone.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And this power lies in the soul of
every man?

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Of every man. But it must be
awakened and brought into action. In the best
of mankind it awakens of itself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This depends on the sphere of action
men adopt!</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. A very just observation, my son;
every man has a just relation to the whole.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Many things lie beyond this sphere.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. He endeavours to collect them
together within it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The time and circumstance of man's
existence are so limited, that men often begin to
know themselves when they are ceasing to live.</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. The life of man is like the course
of the sun. His entrance into life is as the
morning. His noon is his chief period of activity;
his evening is death. Thus the sun leaves
the horizon: his light is lost in twilight, yet his
rays illuminate many a cottage, and are beheld
by the inhabitants of the mountains. Many
things there are which do not appear, but yet
not the less exist. The weak eye of man,
strengthened and assisted by glasses, discovers
things unknown before. Thus your soul's eye.
when you have learnt how to strengthen and
assist it, may make discoveries you do not now
suspect.</p>

<p>Here the old man put his book into his bosom
and arose. Rinaldo beheld him with doubtful
eye, till after a short pause, he said,</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Farewell, my son! Let not your
powers sleep in your mind's eye! Awaken
them! It requires but a breath to fan the spare
into a flame. Farewell!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither are you going?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Whence I came. To the mountain
valley where I dwell.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. May I visit you there?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I invite you to come.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where shall I find your habitation?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Pursue the river's course. Yonder
in the mountain are my scholars constantly
employed in the study of nature's works. They
will show you my dwelling. Meanwhile open
the head of that serpent, and you will find in

<!-- page 38 -->

his brain a small green stone. Take it, and it
will defend you against poison.</p>

<p>The old man now left him, and Rinaldo
beheld him till the mountain concealed him
from his view. He then sought for the stone
in the serpent's brain and having found it, went
back in pensive mood to the castle.</p>

<p>Here it was remarked that Rinaldo appeared
more thoughtful than usual, and Laura invited
him to pass a few moments in her chamber
after supper, which he did as soon as the baron
had retired.</p>

<p>He found her alone, and she appeared confused,
which however Rinaldo avoided noticing.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Chevalier, you have these two days
grown quite thoughtful and absent, and still
more to-day than before. If I knew the cause
of your inquietude, perhaps I might alleviate it.
I trust myself alone with you because I have
something important to disclose. But I rely
upon your honour to pardon the declaration I am
about to make&mdash;should it wound your heart.
You will forgive this expression; for, though I
may be deceived, your behaviour for some days
past perhaps needlessly alarms me for your
pretensions.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I understand you.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fear not.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Declare yourself.</p>

<p>Laura now fixed her eyes upon Rinaldo: a
pause followed, and she first broke silence.

<!-- page 39 -->

<p><i>Laura</i>. I <i>will</i> declare myself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you think me worthy your confidence,
do so.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I will&mdash;I must hazard it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You hazard nothing.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. That we shall see&mdash;know then I
love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Indeed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is that your secret?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. It is.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And why did you not conceal it?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I would find a confidant who will receive
it and guard it as his own.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is so guarded.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Hear me further: my father has an
intention of marrying me. This I know; to
whom I know not. But be it to whom it may,
I am certain I cannot love him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Of that you cannot be certain.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. I know it but too surely; for, to him I
love, I am certain he will not give me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is the question.</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. No question; but certainty. The
man I love is beneath my rank. He is not
noble.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If <i>you</i> think him noble, and if he deserves
the love of a noble heart, he is doubly
ennobled. May I know his name?</p>

<p><i>Laura</i>. Oh, yes: to you I am not afraid to
name him. He is my father's secretary.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As far as I know him, a very worthy
man. I cannot disapprove your passion.</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p><i>Laura</i>. Indeed! Not disapprove it? Not
even though&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I understand you&mdash;though I myself
were the man for whom you were destined by
your father.</p>

<p>A door now opened, and the secretary entered;
then seizing Rinaldo's hand he pressed it
to his bosom, and was about to speak, when the
latter led him up to Laura, placed him in her
arms, and left the room.</p>

<p>Rinaldo slept but little, and left the castle at
daybreak, to visit the dwelling of the old man,
with whom he had lately become acquainted.
He followed the course of the river, entered
the small valley between the hills, and came to
a plain surrounded by steep rocks. Before him
was an olive grove, through which a path way
led directly to three marble statues adorned
with hieroglyphics, and behind them stood an
altar with a beautiful basso relievo, under which
was this inscription, in Greek characters:

<div class="center">

<p class="small">LIKA SARABTALAM.</p>

</div>

<p>Rinaldo was deeply engaged in contemplating
these figures, when he descried a tall thin
old man coming toward him with an olive-branch
in his hair, and a hermit's serpentine
staff in his hand. The man saluted Rinaldo,
saying,</p>

<p>"Welcome, honourable stranger, who yesterday
spoke with our great and beloved master!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo made him a bow of thanks, and he
proceeded thus:</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"You contemplate these figures and the inscriptions
they bear with so much apparent curiosity,
that I can read your wishes in your
eyes. As to the words <i>Lika Sarabtalam</i>, they
signify <i>the Creator of the world</i>, and the same as
the Peruvians call Viracocha. He is represented
by the figure you there see, of an old
man symbolical of the eternal all-creative unity.
The three flames that surround his head
are the symbolic number of perfection. His
extended hands, in which are placed the sun
and the earth, are the symbols of the first number
that arises out of unity, the number of creation
and the type of production. The sun
and the world are links of a chain. The body
of the column is the symbol of harmony, and
is sculptured with the heavenly lyre. It
rests on seven books, which are the seven
books of the secrets of nature, and are sealed
with seven seals. The four cords of the instrument
are the symbol of the tetrachordon, the
union of harmony the number four. This also
is the symbol of the fitness of things as arising
also out of the mathematical point, line, superfices
and depth. These hieroglyphics express
the whole of nature, namely, existence, organization,
plurality, and motion."</p>

<p>Rinaldo beheld his informant with surprise,
and was about to inquire after the old man,
when he himself appeared in the same dress
in which he had seen him the preceding day,
and saluting him in a friendly manner waved
his hand, saying, "Well, my son, you have kept

<!-- page 42 -->

your word." He then conducted him through
flowery fields and said, "This is the valley I
inhabit. It still retains its most ancient name,
and thence I am called in the neighbourhood
the old man of Fronteja, a name which is now
grown so general that I have adopted it myself."</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived that Rinaldo was
much struck with the name mentioned in Olympia's
letter, and which recalled to his mind the
account given him by the Marquis Romano of
this man, with whom he had become so unexpectedly
acquainted, and was now conversing.
At this sudden discovery, the forms of Olympia,
the marquis, and the captain, seemed to
stand before him, and he knew not whether to
advance forward with the old man, or to hasten
away from his presence and return home.
He dreaded a meeting with these persons,
thought himself betrayed, and considered his
aged companion as his mortal enemy.</p>

<p>Having arrived at a small altar the old man
plucked two roses, laid them on the altar, raised
his eyes to heaven, and cried with a loud
voice, "A sacrifice of friendship!" He then
turned to Rinaldo and said, "Stranger, here
you are in safety."</p>

<p>"What should I fear?" said Rinaldo, in a
proud tone.</p>

<p>"Men," replied the old man, and went on
without seeming particularly to notice the inquiry.</p>

<p>"Men there are every where," answered

<!-- page 43 -->

Rinaldo, "and I have nothing to fear that
others may not fear also."</p>

<p>"With us," continued the old man, "I have
told you, you are among friends."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now proceeded with his conductor
without speaking another word, and the latter
showed him his dwelling, which was built in a
very noble and antique style. Upon the mountains
stood hermitages, which, as the old man
said, younger men than himself inhabited, but
who devoted themselves to various studies and
contemplations.</p>

<p>"Is the number of your young men great?"
inquired Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Thrice seven," replied the old man.</p>

<p>They now entered the house, in the middle
room of which the old man regaled his guest
with an excellent breakfast, while himself ate
only a few spoonfuls of honey, and some thin
slices of white bread. He drank no wine, and
his beverage was milk.</p>

<p>"Have you lived here long?" asked Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Not long." answered the old man, "and yet
longer than the age of man."</p>

<p>Rinaldo cast at him a look of doubt and surprise,
and at length inquired:</p>

<p>"Have you really exceeded the usual bounds
of the life of man?"</p>

<p>"Twice," was his reply.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now beheld him with increased surprise.
But the old man seemed not to notice
it, and Rinaldo was about to inquire further,

<!-- page 44 -->

when he heard female voices singing, and saw
two young women in veils pass by hand in hand.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Two of my scholars," replied the old man.</p>

<p>"Do women live here also?"</p>

<p>"Daughters of wisdom, priestesses in the
temple of Nature and of Truth."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was again silent, and the old man invited
him to accompany him to a simple apartment,
where he found a couch, on which the old
man seated himself, and Rinaldo followed his
example.</p>

<p>The old man now broke silence and said,</p>

<p>"From my earliest youth upward, I was a
friend and eager inquirer into all mysteries, and
to this day I must tell you, that I have always
succeeded in developing the secrets of all ages
and nations."</p>

<p>Rinaldo beheld him with surprise, and the
old man proceeded.</p>

<p>"I studied the symbolical mythology of the
Greeks and Egyptians, the theogony, cosmogony,
and all the sacred learning of the most
ancient nations; I studied the shaster of the
Gentoos, the zendavesta of the Persians, the
edda of the Icelanders, the chou-king and ly-king
of the Chinese. I developed the nature
of the kakosophia and kakod&aelig;monia, studied
the anthroposophia, and at length became what
I am now, a true theosophist. This name I
have now adopted. You must imagine it took
a long period of time to accomplish so much
and that time heaven has granted me."</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>Here the theosophist paused, and then said,</p>

<p>"Friend, why did you quit the castle without
mentioning your intention? You have
caused uneasiness there on account of your absence."</p>

<p>"To whom?" inquired Rinaldo.</p>

<p>The old man made no answer but pointed
to a large mirror formed of a plate of polished
metal. Rinaldo looked, and to his utter astonishment,
beheld Laura and Ludovico as it
were in person before him. The motion of
their hands and features showed they were
conversing on some subject very interesting to
them.</p>

<p>"I hear them speak," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Speak?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"You cannot hear them," returned the old
man, "but I hear with the cast of the soul, which
brings me close to them."</p>

<p>"What do they say?"</p>

<p>"The lady is uneasy at your departure, and
your servant is telling her he imagines you are
gone only on some little excursion; but she is
not satisfied with this explanation."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was silent for a few moments, nor
did the old man disturb his reflections. When
Rinaldo again turned his eyes toward the mirror,
he saw Laura in her chamber and the secretary
in her arms. He turned his eyes and
said,</p>

<p>"Friend, you are a great man."</p>

<p>"What I am you may be also," said the old

<!-- page 46 -->

man; "I am not the only man of my kind in
the world."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now with a deep sigh asked, "Do you
know me?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" replied the old man,
and pointed to the mirror.</p>

<p>Rinaldo looked again, and beheld his own
likeness in his banditti dress, upon the Appenines,
in front of Donato's hermitage. He started,
and said, "do you know Donato?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" inquired the old man,
and again pointed to the mirror, where Donato
appeared labouring in his garden.</p>

<p>"I will," said the old man, "show you some
other persons of your acquaintance. Behold the
mirror; they will pass across it."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now perceived the Prince della Rocella,
the father of Aurelia. He seemed pacing
to and fro in an apartment, and reading a book.
The scene changed, and Rinaldo beheld the inside
of a cell in a convent, where Aurelia lay
asleep upon a bed. He sighed and cast his eyes
downward. When he again raised them he
saw the countess Martagno sitting in an arbour
and weeping. Rinaldo now sighed with increased
emotion, and the scene again changing,
a female pilgrim appeared travelling in a desert
country. It was Rosalia.</p>

<p>"Is she still alive?" cried Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"She is," replied the old man.</p>

<p>"Shall I again see her and speak to her."</p>

<p>The old man seemed to reflect and then

<!-- page 47 -->

said, "Upon that I cannot answer with certainty
to-day."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was silent, and the old man asked,
"Would you see any more of your acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>A curtain of blue silk now fell and covered
the mirror, and Rinaldo repeated, "Friend, you
are indeed a great man."</p>

<p>The old man smiled, and said, "Mere magic.
Upon you my pride does not repose." After a
short pause he continued, "you shall see how
deeply I am versed in the obscure mysteries.
I will show you all the degrees of the celebrated
Krata Repoa, which comprehend the sacred
science of the Egyptians. I have unveiled it.
My young men and young women shall perform
that spectacle before you. It will at least serve
as a subject of conversation and of reflection.</p>

<p>Having said this he arose, took Rinaldo by
the hand, and introduced him into a beautiful
hall, whose walls were painted with symbols of
the gods of all nations, and many allegorical
statues stood beside the windows. It was also
decorated with a gallery, and a beautiful ceiling
representing &OElig;dipus answering the riddle of
the Sphynx.</p>

<p>In an antichamber soft music was heard, accompanied
with female voices. Meanwhile the
old man walked in silence to and fro across the
room with Rinaldo.</p>

<p>When the music ceased, the old man said
"Man consists of body and soul. Both seek

<!-- page 48 -->

their particular pleasure and enjoyments. I envy
not each what it desires, within the limits
that are permitted. Harmony is the chain that
unites all beings&mdash;the universal law of all things.
You know what has been said of the music of
the spheres. I love music, whether vocal or
instrumental. Both lie within us, and we give
and receive it with pleasure. The highest expressions
of delight are very pleasing music to
the ear of those who understand them. Even
pain has its appropriate chords, adapted to feeling
and harmonious hearts."</p>

<p>As he said this a table was brought in covered
with a variety of food and drink, of which
the old man pressed Rinaldo to partake. Himself
only ate some thin slices of white bread, a
couple of spoonfuls of honey, and some ananas;
his drink was milk.</p>

<p>When the table was removed, the theosoph
took his visiter by the hand and led him into
another apartment, on the black marble cornice
of which were inscribed in letters of gold, the
words,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">KRATA REPOA.</p>

</div>

<p>"Here," said he, "you shall see the spectacle
I promised, called the Krata Repoa," and
then he reclined on a couch. Rinaldo followed
his example.</p>

<h3>BOOK VI.</h3>

</div>

<p>RINALDO received from the old man some
previous instruction relative to the secrets of the
Egyptian mysteries, and then saw the spectacle
performed, in which the initiated went through
all the seven degrees of Krata Repoa. He saw
him ascending the <i>holy ladder</i>, consisting of seven
steps, amid thunder and lightning&mdash;heard the
<i>language of Hierophants</i>&mdash;saw the <i>gate of man</i>
and the <i>black chamber</i>, the <i>temptation scene</i> of the
priestesses, opposite to whom the initiated stood,
the <i>water scene</i>, the <i>serpent chamber</i>, the <i>griffin</i>
and the <i>columns</i>. He saw the initiated pass
through the <i>gate of death</i>, and refuse the <i>crown</i>;
beheld him in <i>Orcus</i>, and heard the lessons given
him. Here he fancied he saw the battle of the
shades, the <i>pit of the fiend</i>, and the <i>dead virgin</i>.
He saw the battle of <i>Orus and Typhon</i>, and the
great <i>trial by fire</i>. He saw the initiated before
the <i>gate of the gods</i>, the <i>priest's dance</i>, representing
the course of stars, after which the initiated
drank the drink of Oimelas, and his trials ended
in his final reception into the great sanctuary.</p>

<p>This spectacle haying continued a long time,
Rinaldo was again regaled with refreshments,
after which the old man said, "Now, my friend,
return to the castle you have left, where your
presence will this night be needful. Think of
your friend at Fronteja, and ponder well in your
heart what you have seen and heard."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now took his way to the castle,

<!-- page 50 -->

where he banished by his presence all the uneasiness
his absence had occasioned.</p>

<p>At length the family retired to rest, but sleep
still shunned the eyes of Rinaldo, till toward
midnight there was suddenly a loud confused
noise in the castle. He heard the clashing
of swords, the barking of dogs, a loud cry from
without, and at length the report of two muskets.</p>

<p>Upon this he sprang from his bed, threw on
a bedgown, took a pair of pistols and his sabre,
and ran to the hall, where he found Laura and
her father pale and trembling. The maid servants
were there with lights, and equally terrified.
The noise of arms still increased, and
the firing grew louder and louder.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"The castle is attacked by robbers," cried a
servant who was wounded. "We are too
weak to repel them, and several of my fellow
servants are killed."</p>

<p>Ludovico now rushed by with a drawn sabre,
crying, "Let us defend the entrance of
the hall."</p>

<p>Rinaldo flew to the hall door, while the robbers
were pressing upon the marble stairs in
triumph.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Rinaldo with a voice of thunder;
"say who you are, what is your will?"</p>

<p>"Who dares to ask us?" said one of the
troop.</p>

<p>"I do," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>"Aha! not so free with your orders. If you
do not make way it will cost you your life."</p>

<p>"Halt! I say, and take notice with whom
you have to deal."</p>

<p>"Back, and lose not your breath in idle
words."</p>

<p>"Halt! and beware my name do not strike
you to the earth."</p>

<p>Here the robbers burst into a laugh, and one
of them replied, "Men who fear not your
sword will laugh at your name."</p>

<p>"Not at mine!"</p>

<p>At this they laughed again, and cried "forward."
But Rinaldo cried out to them in a
dreadful voice, "Halt, 'tis the command of Rinaldini!"</p>

<p>At this the robbers were struck, and at
length one of them inquired, "where is Rinaldini?"</p>

<p>"I am he," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Profane not that celebrated name. I have
served under Rinaldini, and know him."</p>

<p>"If you know him, come hither, and order
your comrades to halt."</p>

<p>Rinaldo now quitted the door way, and walking
back to the middle of the hall, took a light
from one of the women. Ludovico also, to
whom Rinaldo had given a hint to that effect,
did the same, and lighted the candles in the
chandeliers. Meanwhile Rinaldo continued in
his place, and the baron and Laura, in trembling
expectation, waited to see what would
happen.</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>The man who boasted that he knew Rinaldini,
now bid his companions who were pressing
through the door way to halt, and going up to
Rinaldo with uncertain steps, paused, looked
steadfastly at him, dropped the point of his sabre,
and said,</p>

<p>"Great Captain! I bend my knee to you.
Yes you are Rinaldini, my most renowned captain!"</p>

<p>Upon this the whole troop instantly exclaimed,
"Viva Rinaldini!"</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Rinaldo, "return, or even
accept your salutation, till I find you obedient
to my commands."</p>

<p>"Pronounce them," cried they all as if with
one mouth.</p>

<p>"Pronounce them" repeated one of the
troop&mdash;"Pronounce them most renowned captain.
That which we are bound to give you
shall receive."</p>

<p>"Then I command you," said Rinaldo, "immediately
to leave this castle."</p>

<p>Upon this a silence at first prevailed. Then
a murmur arose, and at length one of them stepped
forward and said,</p>

<p>"We have no money, and are destitute of the
means of subsistence. For this reason we have
undertaken this enterprise, in which we have
succeeded. You know, captain, whither necessity
will drive us. But to show you how great
a respect we feel for such renowned men as
you, we will leave the castle if you will promise
to come to us and stay with us for a while as a

<!-- page 53 -->

friend. If you refuse this we will not go. For
however brave and famous you are, you will see
that force shall not drive us hence. Count our
number; we are eighty of us in the castle, all
armed, and none of us afraid of death. Resolution
is our constant companion, and there are
thirty more without, who are by no means unworthy
to be called our fellows in arms."</p>

<p>"Are you," said Rinaldo, "captain of these
brave fellows?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Luigino."</p>

<p>"Then come forward and prepare for battle.
You shall have the honour to fight with Rinaldini.
If you are victorious, do what you please
in the castle; all I recommend is humanity. If
you are beat, depart together with your people.
These are the conditions of the battle."</p>

<p>Luigino beheld him with astonishment, and
said, "I will not fight with you."</p>

<p>"Then in the presence of your people," replied
Rinaldo, "I call you a cowardly cut-purse."</p>

<p>"By heavens, captain," cried Luigino, "I am
no coward, nor will I suffer myself to be called
so even by you." Thus saying he drew his sabre.</p>

<p>Laura now started with impetuosity, and
threw herself into Rinaldo's arms saying, "You
shall not fight; nor shall you thus hazard your
life for us. We will come to a compromise with
these men and give them what they want. Is
it not enough that we are indebted to you for

<!-- page 54 -->

our lives? must we see our benefactor and preserver
bleed for us?"</p>

<p>"Go, Luigino," said Rinaldo, "and declare
that a maid has deprived you of the honour of
fighting with Rinaldini. I know and acknowledge
you to be a man of courage."</p>

<p>Luigino put his sword in the scabbard, and
said, "We will go."</p>

<p>"Not so," said the baron, holding out a small
box. "Here, take this money," continued he,
"and buy what you want." Meanwhile Rinaldo
took a ring from his finger and said, "Luigino,
wear this ring as a token of remembrance."</p>

<p>Luigino took the ring, and asked in a tone of
disappointment, "And will you not come to us?"</p>

<p>"I will," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Upon this the troop hallooed, and a general cry
arose of "Viva Rinaldini!"</p>

<p>"Leave this man with me," continued Rinaldo:
"he fought with me in the Appenines.
He will show me the way."</p>

<p>Luigino turned toward him, and said, "Brave
Nero, who fought under Rinaldo, stay with your
captain, and bring him to us soon." Having
said this, he took Rinaldo's hand and pressed it,
saying, "This moment I shall never forget!"
Then turning round, he gave his companions
sign, who rushed down stairs and out of the castle,
with Luigino at their head.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now gave Ludovico and Nero a hint
to leave him, as did the baron to his attendants,
and Rinaldo remained alone with him and Laura.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>"You have heard," said Rinaldo, "my most
sacred and important secret, and many others
have heard it also. This renders it absolutely
necessary I should immediately take my leave
of you. The persecuted and proscribed robber captain
can never more be seen in your
family, or become the object of your friendship
and hospitality. Your rank and situation, as
well as the laws, forbid it. Night, which conceals
all things, will also hide me from you.
Farewell! I must depart."</p>

<p>"Your generosity," said the baron, "has
discovered your secret in order to save us from
instant death. This night is indelibly impressed
on my memory. Nor do I lament any
thing so keenly as that you must leave us.
Twice you have saved my life, and I am doubly
your debtor. How shall I&mdash;How can I compensate
you?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You can.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You can.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. Then I am richer than I imagined.
That which I can, I will.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Promise that you will grant my
request.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. I do: and rejoice that I can repay you
by its fulfilment.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My request then is, that you will
give your daughter to the man she loves.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. (<i>starting</i>.) Heavens! What have I
promised?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have passed your word.</p>

<!-- page 56 -->

<p><i>Baron</i>. (<i>hesitating</i>.) Alas! then take her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You misconceive me. I am not the
man of her choice.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. (<i>reviving</i>.) Did I, indeed, mistake
you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Give her to the man she loves.
Remember your promise.</p>

<p><i>Baron</i>. I am your debtor, and will pay you.
I will keep my word. She shall have him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Laura! I shall now depart happy;
since I know you are so.</p>

<p>Laura first embraced her benefactor, then
threw herself at her father's feet. Rinaldo
left the hall, sent up the secretary, gave orders
to saddle his horse, and with Ludovico and
Nero left the castle.</p>

<p>By day-break they had proceeded a considerable
way, and the castle was no longer in
sight. The sun arose in all the splendour of
majesty, and Rinaldo dismounting from his
horse gave Ludovico the bridle, and threw
himself down beneath a tree. Ludovico and
Nero followed their captain's example at some
distance, and the horses began to graze.</p>

<p>Rinaldo sighed deeply, and, as his manner
was when his heart was full, thus communed
with himself: "That for which men thank my
courage and my name, is to me a curse. Yet,
though banished, dishonoured, and persecuted, I
have, it is true, already eluded innumerable
evils. But I have, alas! shed blood. How
many have fallen by my side? How many have
I sent to the grave! Ah, what prophetic voice

<!-- page 57 -->

could have foretold me such a life when rocking
me in the cradle of infancy! Alas! what
fate tore me from my peaceful vales&mdash;from
the spring whose pure lymph fed both me and
my goats in the solitude of pastoral innocence
and virtue? Alas, alas, alas! what am I become?"</p>

<p>"Does the captain often thus talk to himself?"
said Nero.</p>

<p>Ludovico gave a nod of assent, and made a
sign for him to be silent. Meanwhile Rinaldo
proceeded thus:</p>

<p>"Shall I then never find repose? The mariner
rejoices, when the storm is past, in the
security of the harbour, and forgets the danger of
the seas; but to me no friendly port affords
a welcome or a shelter."</p>

<p>Having paused awhile, he inquired of Nero
how he came to Sicily: upon which Nero approached
him, and said, "When you sent me
to Rome, captain, our friend Cinthio came in
search of me and Nicolo, and took us with him
into Calabria. There I had a quarrel with
one of my comrades, whose skull I split. As
this man was a particular friend of Cinthio, I
did not care to see him again, and came into
Sicily. Here having no other means of living, I
had recourse to my old trade."</p>

<p>"How long have you been with Luigino?"</p>

<p>"Six months."</p>

<p>"Do you do well?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well&mdash;but not so well as with you.</p>

<p>"Where does Luigino harbour?"</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>"In the mountains of Cerone."</p>

<p>"Is it far from here?"</p>

<p>"We may arrive there about dusk."</p>

<p>"Show me the way."</p>

<p>They now mounted and trotted on. They
dined at a miserable village, and before sun-set
arrived at the mountains of Cerone.</p>

<p>They had scarcely advanced a hundred paces
when they heard a horn, and after that several
others. This was the signal given by Luigino's
out-posts. They soon came to a valley, where
Nero give a signal, upon which twenty of the
banditti surrounded them, and raised a dreadful
cry of rejoicing, after which they escorted Rinaldo
to Luigino amidst cries of "<i>Viva valoroso
Rinaldini! valorosissimo capitano del mondo!</i>"
Upon which Luigino sprang out of his tent and
helped Rinaldo to dismount.</p>

<p>The joy and confusion occasioned by the presence
of the celebrated Rinaldini was very
great, and even Luigino thought himself highly
honoured by the most renowned captain of
banditti of his day visiting him in his tent and
sleeping on his bed.</p>

<p>At break of day, Luigino perceiving his guest
was already up, came to him with a proposal
which was the result of his nocturnal reflections.
It was no less than that he would take
the command of his troop, and thereby, as he
expressed himself, render it, through him, immortal.</p>

<p>"Friend," replied Rinaldo, "I am heartily
obliged to you for your disinterested offer: but

<!-- page 59 -->

I cannot avail myself of it, since I am resolved
to leave Sicily and go to some other country,
where I may pass the remainder of my days in
tranquillity and repose."</p>

<p>In vain did Luigino exert his utmost eloquence:
for Rinaldo persisted in his intention.
He staid with him, however, the remainder of
the day, and on the following took his departure
with Ludovico and Nero.</p>

<p>Toward evening they reached an inn belonging
to a village from which it lay a few hundred
paces distant, and out of the great road. The
landlord, however, came out, and said, his house
was so full of company that he could not give
the chevalier a decent bed; and that besides a
gentleman and lady had just arrived, together
with their attendants, who would go no further
that night, and had engaged the last bed his
house afforded. But Rinaldo having no inclination
to lengthen his day's journey, declared
he would put up with any accommodations he
could have, and immediately entered the inn-yard,
where, as he dismounted, he cast his eyes
upon a carriage from which the horses had just
been taken off, and, as he was giving some directions
relative to his baggage, he descried, to
his great astonishment, his long lost Signora
Olympia; nor had he recovered his surprise
before he saw his enemy, the Corsican captain,
come round from the other side of the carriage.</p>

<p>The latter no sooner perceived Rinaldo than
he drew a pistol from the coach pocket, and

<!-- page 60 -->

furiously rushed on Rinaldo, at the same time
exclaiming, "Ha! villain! have I found you
at last?"</p>

<p>As he said this he fired, and the ball grazed
Rinaldo's left shoulder. Meanwhile Olympia
screamed, and threw herself back in the carriage.</p>

<p>Ludovico no sooner saw what passed than
he levelled his musket and fired, by which he
broke the captain's right arm, who fell, and
cried with all his might, "Shut the gates! In
the name of the king, seize this man! Rinaldini
is here!"</p>

<p>Upon this a general confusion and uproar
arose, and the landlord, his servants and
waiters, the attendants of the captain, some
muleteers, coachman, and a couple of dragoons
who were stationed there as patroles, fell upon
Rinaldo with horsewhips, sticks, spades, pitchforks,
and sabres.</p>

<p>A waiter ran to the gate to fasten it, but
Nero shot him through the throat, and instantly
galloped out of the inn full speed.</p>

<p>Rinaldo attempted to take out his pistols,
but was suddenly seized from behind, and
thrown down before he could fire. Six men
fell upon him at once, who bound his feet and
tied his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>Ludovico cut down one of the captain's
servants through the head, and cut off half the
arm of another, but he received a blow on his
head and fell, upon which, he was treated like

<!-- page 61 -->

his master. He gnashed his teeth, and impotent
rage distorted every feature of his face.</p>

<p>Rinaldo beheld him with a look of reproach,
and said, "For shame, Ludovico! why those
unmanly gestures? Every one has his destiny,
and our hour is come."</p>

<p>" 'Tis not that that enrages me," said Ludovico,
roaring with rage; "but that a handful of
cowardly lubbers should thus overpower us, and
that we have not fallen fighting man to man in
open combat."</p>

<p>"Such is the will of fate," replied Rinaldo;
"be peaceful and quiet&mdash;we are not yet on the
scaffold. But even should we end our lives
there, yet we are not at present in a situation to
help ourselves."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the captain had strictly enjoined
the landlord and the dragoons to keep the
strictest guard over the prisoners, and told them
the price they would receive from government
for their extraordinary valour. Hence they
resolved to watch them throughout the night,
and the next morning to proceed with them in
triumph and deliver them up to the nearest
tribunal.</p>

<p>The prisoners were therefore brought into
a room, where they were strictly guarded.
The captain was carried to bed, his wounds
dressed, as well as could be done, till a surgeon
should arrive, and Olympia remained in the
greatest embarrassment and distress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the landlord collected together
all those who had taken an active part in the

<!-- page 62 -->

struggle and in securing the prisoners, and thus
addressed them: "See, upon this table I have
set down, in chalk, the proportion each of us
is entitled to receive of the price set by the government
on the head of Rinaldini. This is the
account as exact as a parish rate. Besides
which, we shall also gain great fame and
honour, and the thanks and respect of the
whole island, and my inn will become extremely
celebrated and frequented."</p>

<p>"But," said one of the muleteers, at the
same time twisting his cap from his right to his
left ear, "do you think Rinaldini's gang will
leave one stone of your inn upon another?"</p>

<p>With this question the landlord seemed much
struck, and asked with the utmost anxiety,
"Has he then a gang?"</p>

<p>"You fool!" exclaimed the muleteer, "that
you may easily imagine&mdash;a band of fellows that
fear not all hell, were it collected together
against them. As for me, were I in your place,
I would have opened every gate and door of
my house that he might escape. That would
certainly have turned to better account than
that you will now have to settle with his gang."</p>

<p>"True," said the landlord, "but then I will
quit the place, and with the money I receive,
open an inn elsewhere."</p>

<p>"That is an excellent plan," cried several of
the company.</p>

<p>The landlord was about to answer, when he
was sent for by Olympia. He went out to her

<!-- page 63 -->

immediately, and Olympia taking him aside,
said,</p>

<p>"Landlord, you are a most fortunate man
that Rinaldini has been taken prisoner at your
house: but whatever you may gain by it will
be doubled by him if you could find means to
favour his escape."</p>

<p>"Most beautiful lady." replied the landlord,
"that is now impossible. It might be done
were not these curst dragoons here. And then
my duty and allegiance as a subject&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Olympia, interrupting him,
"you are a brave fellow; I frankly confess to
you I only wanted to try you, for you cannot
doubt that I shall be very glad to see this enemy
of the captain, my brother, punished. I
only wanted to know if the villain were in safe
hands. I find he is, and shall also reward you.
Now I shall sleep in peace, since I am under
the roof of so honourable a man."</p>

<p>Olympia now retired, and the landlord murmured
as she went, "A very good lady indeed!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo desired to have some wine and refreshments,
which he obtained, and Ludovico,
who had come to himself, was now as firm and
resolute as his master was discouraged and cast
down. They began to converse in their robber-jargon,
of which their guards did not understand
a word, and talked of their misfortunes
and present situation; when Rinaldo confessed
he intended to take poison. But Ludovico advised
him by no means to be so rash and precipitate,

<!-- page 64 -->

and began even to hope some help
might soon arrive.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. From whom can you expect it?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That I know not, but yet I have
hopes. My courage has unexpectedly returned,
and I am fully persuaded we shall not die
this time. And in fact 'tis much the same to
tear our entrails by poison, or to be burnt to
death. Death is death, and pain is pain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you think so?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. 'Tis certain. But three things vex
me horribly.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What are they?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. First, that the ball did not go
through the captain's head: secondly, that a
parcel of muleteers and drivers should master
us: and thirdly, that Nero has forsaken us like
a coward. Had we all three stood by each
other and cut our way out, the rascals would
have had the worst of it, or I will acknowledge
myself for a coward.</p>

<p>Thus they conversed till midnight, and at
length fell asleep on their bed of straw.</p>

<p>After a time they were suddenly waked by
a noise, and starting up beheld two men in the
room with daggers, while their guards lay
snoring on the ground.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" said Rinaldini.</p>

<p>"Hush! captain," said they; "we are come
to save you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo thinking he knew the voice, asked,
"Are you not Nero?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied he; "the house is surrounded,

<!-- page 65 -->

and I and one of my brave comrades have
found our way in. 'Tis now day-break&mdash;be
quick and rise." Upon this they cut Rinaldo's
cords and helped him up.</p>

<p>"Nero," said Ludovico, "I have been unjust
to you; I accused you of being a coward; I
beg your pardon, my brave comrade!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" replied Nero, "that I expected:
but no matter; I set off and fell in with Luigino's
out-posts, from which I despatched a man
to the captain, informing him of what had
happened. The other eight I took with me.
We mounted and here we are. Luigino I am
sure is not far off.</p>

<p>"Nero," said Rinaldo, "I will certainly reward
you and your comrades handsomely for
this service."</p>

<p>"Come captain, down stairs. Here are
arms should there be any alarm."</p>

<p>Thus they slipped out and all remained
quiet in the house. The rest of the party
waited in the court, and took as many horses
and mules from the stables as they wanted, and
then an alarm was given.</p>

<p>A rocket then appeared in the air before the
inn. "Ha!" cried they all, "That is Luigino's
signal." They were incapable of restraint, and
six balls were fired at once into the room,
where several men were lying upon straw, and
thereupon a dreadful cry arose.</p>

<p>At the same time the gate was broke open
by those without, and Luigino's party rushed

<!-- page 66 -->

into the yard, where the alarm was given in all
quarters, and the stables instantly emptied.</p>

<p>When Luigino found Rinaldo was saved, he
embraced him, and at the same time gave the
signal of departure. The robbers, however,
fired off their pistols toward the above mentioned
room and stable, and set off with their
booty. They had scarcely advanced a hundred
paces before they heard the alarm-bell rung,
and looking behind them beheld the whole inn
in flames.</p>

<p>A wild outcry prevailed throughout the premises;
and Rinaldo's heart misgave him. He
covered his face with his hands, and pursued
his way to the mountains.</p>

<p>Watching and reflecting on his situation and
prospects, Rinaldo lay upon his bed beneath a
tent. The greater part of the band were gone
upon various expeditions, and with them Ludovico
and Nero. Luigino came up to Rinaldo,
looked at him awhile, and said,</p>

<p>"Captain, you perceive that you cannot live
out of our circle. The civilized world is not a
fit place for you. Stay in these uninhabited
vallies, and in woods and solitudes, feared and
honoured at the head of your comrades. Do
not abandon yourself to cares, for such is your
destiny and the will of fate."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I feel the truth of your observation
but too strongly.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I am glad of it. I renew my former
offer. Place yourself at the head of my

<!-- page 67 -->

troop, and I will serve under you as second in
command.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will stay with you, but I cannot
take the command of your band. Yet in case
of need you may rely upon me as much as any
one of your men.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. As you please. In any case your
presence will have a great effect on them, and
they will all consider themselves as serving under
you.</p>

<p>While they were thus speaking the signal of
return was heard from a party who had been
out, and had taken booty, and Ludovico, almost
breathless, entered the tent saying, "Captain,
we have taken a great prize; one that will
give you much pleasure. That cursed Corsican
and the beauteous Olympia have fallen into
our hands."</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, they were both
brought bound into the tent, upon which the
whole troop exclaimed, "<i>Viva valorissimo capitano
Rinaldini</i>."</p>

<p>Rinaldo started and shuddered when he beheld
the prisoners bound. Olympia threw herself
on her knees before him and said. "I surrender
myself to your mercy."</p>

<p>Rinaldo made a sign for her to rise, and answered,
"I am not captain of the party that
has taken you, but this man who stands near
me. To him address your petition. I am not
your judge. But since I am indebted to you,
Olympia, for my life and deliverance in Calabria,

<!-- page 68 -->

I request my friend Luigino, for my sake,
to give you your liberty."</p>

<p>"She is free," Luigino instantly exclaimed.
Upon which her bonds were taken off, and
Luigino continued thus: "But as to what concerns
this captain, take him to the cavern, and
imprison him till I have learnt from Ludovico
all that he has done against my friend the great
Rinaldini."</p>

<p>The captain, who had hitherto stood motionless,
now raised his voice, and said; "What I
have done against Rinaldini every good citizen
would have done also who should see the chief
of robbers among his fellow citizens."</p>

<p>Luigino now gave some of his men the wink,
which they immediately understood, and took
the captain out of the tent.</p>

<p>Olympia had placed herself upon a camp
stool, and Rinaldo continued lying upon his bed,
while Luigino went out of the tent.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh, thou celebrated Rinaldini!
Thou who art the fear and terror of all the states
in Italy!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, speak not thus!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Are you really not the leader of
these men?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am not.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Yet you live among them?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is not my fault. I must not,
cannot return to the bosom of civilized society.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. If you are averse to that, remain
in your vallies, and live in tranquillity among
the rocks, nor restrain yourself within the

<!-- page 69 -->

narrow bounds of society. What you would
there find is easy to be forborne. O that it
were my lot to live in such peaceful solitude!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then go to the old man of Fronteja!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Do you know him?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How could I say I know him? I
have indeed seen and spoken to him, and he
has said and shown to me a great many things,
and even a representation of his Krata Repoa.
But how should I venture to say I know him?
Do you know him?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I have never seen or spoken to
him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. This solemn, mysterious, all grasping
impostor?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. He is still more. The chains he
has contrived to throw over all Italy, and even
across the sea, are a work that speaks the praise
of the master. Since you have become so
famous, you have been an important object of
his wishes. You became a link of the chain
for which he sought. He found you before
you knew it. You were his before he saw
you!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What say you?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That which I know.</p>

<p>As she said this, she smiled as one who
spoke with conscious certainty. Rinaldo cast
his eyes upon the ground. Three shot were
heard at no great distance. Olympia went to
the entrance of the tent, but instantly returned,
and Rinaldo beheld her with an inquiring
countenance.</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Alas! they are bringing the corpse
of the captain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is he dead?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Your most bitter enemy in this
world.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Does he also belong to the chain of
the old man of Fronteja.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. He was an apostate.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How did he live?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. By speculation, gaming, and with
magic, but you his greatest prize, and that on
which he placed his chief reliance, escaped
him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How came you to return to this
deceiver?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Through want of money.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your noble attachment&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Was formed by necessity and broken
off by disgust.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you now intend to do?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. To throw myself into your arms,
and continue with you; with you to brave all
dangers, even to death itself. By your side will
I fight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will fight no more. I will exchange
my sword for spades and ploughshares.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And turn hermit?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The same.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Then I will accompany you as a
female. In my arms you shall repose when
you return fatigued with the heats and labours
of the day. As a careful housewife will I refresh
you with a wholesome repast, and peaceful

<!-- page 71 -->

joy shall never be absent from your hermitage.
Come my Rinaldo, let us go and sojourn
in the tranquil asylum of happiness and peace.
I shall feel no hardship. My affection for you
win smooth every path, and convert perils into
security.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You rave!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Because I am with the object of my
love.</p>

<p>They were now interrupted by a loud conversation
without the tent. Luigino, who knew
how to live, had ordered a sumptuous entertainment
to be prepared, which was now
brought in. No attendants, however, importuned
the guests, who, free from restraint, abandoned
themselves to the feelings of their hearts.</p>

<p>The cork now flew from a bottle of Champagne
with a loud report, and struck the tender
fair one on the forehead, at which the company
laughed, and proceeded to empty the
bottle.</p>

<p>Again they burst into a roar, when Luigino
came and said, "My people have taken a pilgrim
who knows Ludovico."</p>

<p>" 'Tis Rosalia," cried Rinaldo, who instantly
sprang up, rushed out of the tent and flew to
the arms of Rosalia.</p>

<p>After the first effusions of joy, Rosalia told
Rinaldo, that having escaped on the night of
the bloody affray in Calabria, she had long wandered
in solitudes, and had at length come to
Sicily, through whose lonely vales she had travelled
in a pilgrim's dress, till at length she had

<!-- page 72 -->

now obtained the object of her heart's desire,
by again finding her dear Rinaldo.</p>

<p>During this interview, Olympia behaved with
great prudence and discretion, but Rosalia could
not conceal her jealousy. She confessed her
fears and suspicions to Rinaldo, who endeavoured
to pacify her to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Luigino observed what passed,
and as soon as he was alone with Rinaldo, took
the liberty thus to express his opinion:</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I perceive, captain, that report said
true when it painted you as a declared admirer
of women; nor have you been caricatured in
this respect by the picture that has been drawn
of you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps, however, they exceeded
the truth.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. That I will not decide, I only speak
of what I see.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what do you see?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. That you have two of them with
you at once, both of whom you have loved and
love still.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what inference do you draw?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I will frankly confess I do not think
it becomes you to toy away your time with
women.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you a woman hater?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. By no means. But my friendship
for them only admits of giving them a few
passing moments, when passion surprises me.
But then it is soon over. Both of us pursue a
course of life in which we can neither give our

<!-- page 73 -->

wives a house to live in, nor a comfortable
home. Our children we cannot educate; and
if we could, to what could we bring them up?
To what but a course like ours? And since we
cannot send them forth into the world, shall we
bring them up directly for the gallows? That
we would neither of us do.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then let us leave this course.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. What, for the sake of the women?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have treasures which are safely
buried, and may again be found. The Canary
Islands are blest with the finest of climates.
Thither rich vallies and happy plains invite us.
Take a wife and follow me.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I cannot resolve on such a step.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And why not?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I am afraid of tranquillity which
may permit conscience to awaken. Are you
not afraid of it also?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I open my heart to the delights of
peace. I hear her conciliatory voice, and obey
her call.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. And what can you do? Repent,
perhaps? But can you undo what is done and
past?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. We may make restitution.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. At what price will you pay for
flames, blood, and robbery?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. At whatever price the greatest penitence
can require.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. And though you build churches and
altars, will they procure you happy dreams?
Can a deliberate retrospect of your past life

<!-- page 74 -->

procure your peace? You have intoxicated
yourself. You will awaken, and then, alas!
nothing but another intoxicating draught can
sooth you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Not so, Luigino; not so.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. It is my maxim to act on some fixed
plan. Mine was formed before I began to
pursue this course of life.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Holla! Marco! some wine!</p>

<p>Rinaldo looked with an inquiring countenance
at Luigino, who drew a seat to the table, and
sitting down as the wine came in, poured some
out and drank.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Wine, they say, brings out the
truth. You shall hear my story. I am by
birth a Corsican, and my father was governor
of Bastia. But Luigino is not my true name.
My father was a very worthy man, who loved
his country, and hated its oppressors, the
French. His sentiments were not unknown,
and the French general watched him narrowly.
There arose an insurrection in the valley of
Ajaccioli, where a French officer had dishonoured
the wife of a Corsican. The latter
having killed the criminal, the general ordered
the Corsican to be bound, and condemned him
to death. His countrymen, however, rescued
him, and took up arms.</p>

<p>My father was called upon to suppress the
rebellion; but he was so imprudent as to reply,
that he would only bear arms against the
enemies of his country. On this account he

<!-- page 75 -->

was thrown into prison where the general
ordered him to be strangled as one guilty of
high treason. My mother made me take an
oath to revenge my father's death, and plunged
a poniard in her own bosom. With the same
poniard I killed the French general, took
refuge among the mountains, and afterward
came on board an English vessel to Sicily, and
my property being confiscated, and my name
publicly exposed, took to the course of life I
have since pursued. This was my choice and
my plan. I have now about ninety men under
my command, who know how to fight, and it
would be easy to increase their numbers.
There are ships to be bought. You, Rinaldini,
have money; employ some of it in a naval expedition,
and deserve the blessings of an oppressed
country.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Luigino!</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Come with me to Corsica, and
break the fetters of my countrymen. Thousands
will join us, and your now dishonoured
name will be recorded with glory in the annals
of history: whereas your amours will never
procure you the honour of becoming the deliverer
of an injured but brave nation. At
present you wander like a vagabond from one
hole and corner to another, and are contemned,
persecuted, and proscribed like the most abject
criminal who basely murders the unwary passenger:
whereas you have but to desire it, to
soar upon the wings of Fame to the temple of
immortality. Your robberies will be forgotten,

<!-- page 76 -->

and the whole world will talk of your glorious
deeds. The press and the mint, triumphal
arches and statues will perpetually record your
bravery; your bust will live in the temple of
Fame, and your name be classed with the deliverers
of nations. If you must change your
mode of life, be this your choice, and your lot
will be at once great and enviable.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Luigino! some god has inspired
thee with these noble thoughts!</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Rinaldini!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Give me your hand. Corsica shall
be emancipated!</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Corsica shall be free. The thought
was mine: yours shall be the fame.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. O Luigino! the sound of the broken
chains of your country shall silence the voice of
conscience, and every self-reproach shall be
hushed in the soothing, harmony of revered
freedom: with the regeneration of your country
a new day will dawn upon our lives.</p>

<p>Marco now entered and whispered something
to Luigino, who sprang up and went out
with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo looked for Rosalia, and
Olympia also joined him.</p>

<p>"All is not right," said she.</p>

<p>"What is not right?" replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"There is a talk of soldiers&mdash;of an attack&mdash;and
of a defence," replied Olympia.</p>

<p>Rinaldo left his tent, went in search of Luigino,
and found Rosalia weeping beneath a

<!-- page 77 -->

tree. When she saw Rinaldo approach, she
endeavoured to conceal her tears, but in vain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have been weeping, Rosalia;
say for what cause?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I&mdash;the pleasure that&mdash;I have&mdash;in
seeing you again, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No excuses or disguises! Why have
you been weeping?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I scarcely know myself. I was
thinking&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What were you thinking?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I was thinking&mdash;that if Rinaldo&mdash;Ah!
what a child I am!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Proceed.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. If Rinaldo should no longer love
me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Why were you thinking that?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Because&mdash;I scarcely know why myself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I must know all.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. The signora&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Should give you no uneasiness.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I love.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So do I.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. Alone?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No jealousy: when I assure you I
love you.</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I love you alone&mdash;and&mdash;O Rinaldo!
command me to leave you, or dismiss the signora:
I cannot stay while she is here.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh! you little simpleton.</p>

<!-- page 78 -->

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. I love you so dearly!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you go, Olympia will stay; if
you stay she will go; and so all will be well.
Besides, my requesting you to stay is the same
as to command the signora you hate so bitterly
to leave me: can you desire more?</p>

<p><i>Rosalia</i>. All I desire is your love, and that
undivided.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have known me already. Did
I ever act otherwise toward you than generously?</p>

<p>Ludovico now came running to Rinaldo with
intelligence that it was expected they would be
presently surrounded by troops. Luigino therefore
visited the out-posts and re-enforced the
guard at the entrance of the mountain valley.
Rinaldo set forward, with Ludovico, in search
of Luigino, who appearing somewhat dejected,
Rinaldo asked him the cause.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I have received certain intelligence
that we are surrounded.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And does that confound you, Corsican?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Not that; because we may cut our
way through: but when I reflect that this very
night, perhaps, after forming so noble a plan, our
power may be cut short&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It will not be. But are we really
surrounded?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. About a league off, all around us,
are a body of above four hundred men.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you intend to do?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. To wait their attack.</p>

<!-- page 79 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My advice is, to strike through to
the south side of the mountain, and get to the
mountain of Larino, where you will have woods
in the rear, and a chain of mountains on your
flank.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. I am very willing, if you will but
fight with us.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will. Choose me out sixteen of
the boldest of your band, besides whom I will
take Nero and Ludovico. We will throw the
troops into an alarm, while you are cutting your
way through with the women and the baggage,
after which we will soon find means to join you.</p>

<p>Luigino immediately gave orders to strike
the tents and to collect the baggage, together
with the women and children, in the centre of
the camp. Rinaldo was furnished with the
men he desired; each of whom was armed
with a double-barrelled gun and two pair of
pistols, besides a sword. Ludovico and Nero
joined them, and Rinaldo having taken an affectionate
leave of Rosalia, and recommended
her to Luigino's particular care and protection,
marched to the pass, where he drew in the advanced
guard, and ordered them to join the
main body. He then marched slowly along
the plain, and at day-break gave the signal of
attack.</p>

<p>They turned the first piquet of the enemy
they met, and the second was almost cut to
pieces; after which the alarm was given through
the whole front.</p>

<p>They now heard firing on the mountain,

<!-- page 80 -->

which grew weaker and weaker, till at length
it wholly ceased. Upon which Rinaldo concluded
the main body had opened a way
through the enemy, and passed. Rinaldo
therefore took the right, in order to leave the
mountain behind him, and forced his way
through a strong body of troops. Here he
had a very brisk engagement, in which six of
his men were killed; but at length the troops
began to give way, and being then attacked with
increased vigour, fell into complete disorder.
Rinaldo's party took some horses from the
enemy, and of his remaining twelve men four
were mounted, as was Rinaldo himself. He
now marched slowly back toward the pass,
whence he sent eight men up the mountain,
while he himself, with Ludovico, Nero, Marco,
and Mangato, all mounted, sought the plain,
and wheeled to the left, to reach the mountain of
Larino on the west side.</p>

<p>When they had advanced about half a league,
they fell in with a body of about thirty men,
whom there was no possibility of avoiding.
They therefore attacked them, broke their
line, cut their way through, and then fell in
with a patrol of cavalry of eight men. These
they engaged, cut down two dragoons, and the
rest took to flight. Nero and Mangato were
wounded.</p>

<p>They now heard a tumult behind them.
The men Rinaldo had detached to the mountain
had found the pass strongly occupied, and
therefore drew off toward the plains. Here

<!-- page 81 -->

they found three of their main body who had
been cut off, and whom they joined; while
Terlini, a man of shrewd mind, who had taken
the command of them, vigorously attacked the
troops Rinaldini had left in his rear. Rinaldo
perceiving by the firing, that these men were
engaged, hastened to succour them, and attacking
the troops in the rear, soon routed
them. Of ten men whom Terlini commanded,
only two besides Terlini himself, escaped unhurt;
six were killed, and the rest were left,
mortally wounded, upon the field. Terlini received
one of the horses taken from the enemy
for his bravery; his comrades, Romato and
Bellione, were taken up behind by Ludovico,
and Marco; and they then pursued their way,
till having proceeded some leagues, a brisk fire
at a very small distance obliged them to strike
into a wood opposite to them, which led them
by day-break into a forest, where having penetrated
a considerable way, they unsaddled their
horses, and reposed themselves by a fountain.</p>

<p>Having rested, the following conversation
arose.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What ails you, Terlini? Why do
you seem so uneasy?</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. I am impatient at this delay.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Even if we had no need of it ourselves,
we must necessarily rest our horses, if
we wish them to carry us any further.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. But here we have no provisions.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Of that indeed I feel the want.

<!-- page 82 -->

However we will set forward as soon as possible.
I have already formed a plan. Meanwhile
let me have your opinion relative to our
proceedings: for I doubt not that every one of
you has been silently reflecting upon it during
this halt. Speak, Terlini, what think you?</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. My opinion, in one word, is, that we
should endeavour to set to the mountain of
Larino, when we shall certainly fall in with
Luigino.</p>

<p><i>Bellione</i>. That is my opinion also.</p>

<p><i>Romato</i>. And mine too. For here we are
neither strong enough nor sufficiently secure to
maintain our position, especially as we have
neither provisions nor ammunition.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. These may be procured. What
think the rest of you?</p>

<p><i>Marco</i>. I have no opinion but yours.</p>

<p><i>Mangato</i>. I am willing to do as you please.
Go where you will I will accompany you. But
I own I wish to rejoin our comrades.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. The only question is, whether the road
to the mountain of Larino is open or not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is the first object that must be
investigated.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. It is undoubtedly surrounded by
troops.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. We are eight of us&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. We have lost half our number.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. We have our fists and our swords,
and besides are mounted.</p>

<!-- page 83 -->

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Not all of us.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. We shall cut our way through.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If it be possible we shall. But the
greatest courage cannot perform impossibilities.
Many of our men have fallen to rise no more.
Shall we throw away our lives?</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Without necessity it were folly.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. Well, captain, let us hear your
opinion?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My opinion is, that you should go
out upon the scout with Bellione and Romato.
Let Marco and Mangato do the same, and procure
provisions. The rest of us will reconnoitre
the forest. Before us we perceive the ruins of
a castle, on a hill in the midst of the trees. Be
that our rendezvous; there we will meet again.
This is my opinion, which, if it be disapproved,
every one may do as he pleases, for I have no
right to demand implicit obedience. You are
under the command of Luigino. Ludovico and
Nero belong to me, and will continue with me.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. Then I demand the rest to go with
me; our wives and children are with Luigino.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are free to do as you please.
If you go, take the horses with you. Here
they are but an incumbrance to us.</p>

<p><i>Terlini</i>. As you please.</p>

<p><i>Marco</i>. I will go with Terlini. Yet I am
sorry to leave the great Rinaldini here without
support.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have Ludovico and Nero with me.</p>

<p><i>Marco</i>. Should any misfortune befall you

<!-- page 84 -->

here, by heavens Luigino will punish us severely.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fear not; we shall soon see each
other again.</p>

<p>Here a pause ensued. At length Terlini
gave Rinaldo his hand and took leave of him.
Marco, Romato, Bellione, and Mangato, followed
his example, taking with them the horses,
while Rinaldo remained behind with Ludovico
and Nero.</p>

<p>Rinaldo silently ascended the hill where the
ruins of the castle lay, and Nero also followed
him in silence.</p>

<p>"Here," said Rinaldo, "are footsteps in the
grass. Be careful to keep upon your guard."</p>

<p>As they approached the ruins several birds
took their flight, but they saw no human creature.
They entered a large court built round,
having door ways without doors, and found a
winding stair case which they ascended. It
led to the second story, where Rinaldo walked
out upon a platform, grown over with laurel,
to take a view of the country. To the left beyond
the wood, he beheld a beautiful valley;
to the right were mountains, and he was surprised
to perceive some objects he remembered
to have seen before.</p>

<p>"Ludovico," said he, "do you know that place
to the right?"</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Yes, I know it well.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you see yonder castle?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Yes, by heavens! 'tis the castle of
good countess of Martagno.

<!-- page 85 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. There we were well, and yet we
could not stay there.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. We dare not stay where we are
well. Persecution always follows close at our
heels.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. That is cursedly unfortunate!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah, Dianora! Art thou still within
those walls! Thinkest thou still of thy unfortunate
lover? O, heavens! Ludovico; you
must go.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Go whither?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To the neighbourhood of the castle.
You may reconnoitre, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. I understand you, captain, you need
not say another word. Leave it to me. You
shall soon hear some news, at least as good as
can be procured. Adieu. We shall soon meet
again.</p>

<p>Thus saying, he hastened away, and Rinaldo
remained deeply immersed in thought, till
Nero awakened him from his reverie by observing,
that he saw a house in the forest.</p>

<p>Rinaldo looked toward the place but could
only see the roof. He immediately resolved to
discover who inhabited the house, and left the
castle, Nero following him in silence.</p>

<p>At length they came to an open place, and
were scarcely ten paces from the house when
the sound of a guitar struck their ear, and induced
them to stop. Upon listening they heard
a voice singing, but could only distinguish the

<!-- page 86 -->

burden of the song, which recurred after every
verse;</p>

<p class="small">If thou lov'st me,<br/>

Then I love thee.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Rinaldo, "since love is the subject
of the song, we have little to fear. In the
asylum of love and pleasure no ambush awaits
us."</p>

<p>Thus saying, he advanced toward the house,
and Nero involuntarily followed him, but being
prepared for some mischance, took his musket
in his hand upon the full cock.</p>

<p>Before the door sat a man in a brown hermit's
dress, who had no sooner perceived the
unexpected visiters, than he laid down his guitar,
and springing forward a few steps, stopped
and called out, "Is it possible? Do my eyes
deceive me, or is it true? Are you really he?
Do I see you again?"</p>

<p>"That voice," said Rinaldo; "Good heavens?
Are you he? Are you my dear Cinthio?"</p>

<p>"I am," cried he, and instantly embraced
Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Yes, by heavens, it is Cinthio," said Nero.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. O my friend! My Cinthio, and do
we see each other again?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. My wish is fulfilled, my eager wish,
that if you were alive I might see you again.
Now my heart rejoices to meet its old friend.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Embrace as long as you like, but give
me a shake of the hand. You know me, old
messmate, don't you?</p>

<!-- page 87 -->

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Ah, Nero! Welcome a thousand
times!</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Well, I am heartily rejoiced to see
you again alive and hearty, and in a singing
humour.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Here in my house, we will celebrate
this unexpected meeting with a cheerful glass.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. By heavens we want something. We
have fasted like so many Carthusians. If you
have any thing good, give us a little. It will
taste excellently nice just now. 'Tis a pity
Ludovico is not with us. For he would be
glad of something also.</p>

<p>They now sat down to some refreshment of
bread, cheese, butter, and wine. They ate
with great appetite, and drank freely of the
wine, during which the following conversation
arose:</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But how came you here? And
whose house is this?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. You shall hear presently. When
I made my escape from that bloody affray in
Calabria, I wandered about among the mountains,
with my wounds, till I met with a good
old hermit, who received me at his hermitage,
dressed my wounds, and attended me. To
this worthy man I discovered myself, and he
expatiated so much to me on the excellence of
virtue, that I promised him to forsake my former
course of life, and to live with piety and
strictness in a monastery.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Excuse my laughing.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Do not laugh, for though at first I

<!-- page 88 -->

was but half serious, I had nearly complied
with his suggestions.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Had you, by heavens?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. My benefactor gave me letters to
a monastery, and I set forward on the way.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I could almost imagine I saw you
passing your noviciate there.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. However I did not go.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Ay, so I thought. One of Rinaldini's
men and a monastery agree as little as fire and
water. They would be always at variance.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I unfortunately fell in with six of
our comrades, who also made their escape.
They had taken up their quarters in a cave of
the mountain, and had been joined by five
other robbers, with whom they carried on their
old trade.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. That was very well.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Thus I suffered myself to be persuaded
to stay with them, and did not go to
the monastery, but pursued my old course of
life. I went further up the country, and took
up my quarters in the mountain of Girace.
Here my corps increased, and we were soon
six and twenty strong, when I resolved on
striking a grand blow upon a monastery, where
we came off with the worst.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Heavens!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I know not whether our plan was
betrayed, or whether fate would have it so,
but the monks had a party of militia in the
neighbourhood. Thus we met with a very

<!-- page 89 -->

bad reception, and I had nearly fallen into their
hands.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Thunder and lightning.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Fortune, however, still enabled me
to make my escape on board a corn vessel
bound for Malta. On board this vessel I sailed,
and as we lay off Sicily left her, and went up
the country. Here I fell in with some fellows
of my own stamp, whom I joined, and carried
on in a small way the trade we had formerly
pursued in the great. Having at length collected
a good heap of gold, my people insisted on
a division, which being complied with, they left
me, saying, they had enough to get into some
creditable business. Tired of robbery and
plunder, I put on a traveller's dress. But my
former habits and pursuits led me to seek out
every hole and corner where I expected to find
people of my own stamp. I was once so fortunate
as to find two bags of gold, which had
certainly belonged to some rich man, for they
were sealed with a very large coat of arms.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I was scarcely possessed of this
treasure before I began to think of retirement.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Happy thought!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I put on this dress and went to a
village about a league from this spot, where I
waited on the forester of the place, whom I
informed of my intention of living as a hermit.
He told me his late master, the Baron, had
three years before his death adopted that mode
of life through inclination; that he had built

<!-- page 90 -->

himself a house in the forest, and had lived as a
hermit till his death; that his son lived in the
town, was always in want of money, and would
doubtless sell me the house. I bought it, and
now live on my own estate.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Aha!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But how came you by a sweetheart?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Who told you I had one?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your song.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Aha! Has it betrayed me? Well,
yes, I have a sweetheart, a lovely good girl,
who supplies me with milk, bread, eggs, butter,
and other provisions, and visits me every three
days. She is the forester's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Well, are you to be married at last?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Brave Cinthio! I am quite pleased
with your account of yourself.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. But my dear girl is still more so.
We have already formed our plan of life. Her
father, who knows of her attachment will give
up his place to me, and remove hither, where
he will pass the remainder of his days witnessing
the happiness of his only child.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Let me embrace you. Take her,
my friend, and make her happy. What is her
name?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Eugenia.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fill your glasses. Let us drink her
health, or yours and hers together, and may
you enjoy all the happiness conjugal affection
can confer.</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p><i>Nero</i>. I drink it with all my heart. But I can
scarcely believe it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. May I be happy like you, my brave
fellow!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I have often thought of you. I have
bewailed you as a friend that is dead; but I
have cherished the remembrance, and even
loved your ashes, as myself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now, then, you will acknowledge I
was right.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Yes, yes: besides you are with me,
and my joy is complete.</p>

<p>Eugenia now unexpectedly arrived, and was
astonished to find so many strangers with her
lover, who introduced them to her as his
friends. Eugenia, however, seemed to take no
particular interest in them, and appeared much
embarrassed, which Cinthio perceiving, encouraged
her to speak.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. You need not fear my visiters. I
have already told you they are my friends, and
you have no secrets I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. No secrets, but, I am in great trouble.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. So you appear. But what is the
matter? On what account?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. On your account.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. On my account! What danger
threatens me?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Ah! one cannot know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Speak! would you make me uneasy
also?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Ah, no. But hear me, hear the
news I bring.</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. News! what?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. You have heard of the great robber
Rinaldini!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Oh, yes, frequently.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. He is here in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Yes, in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Impossible!</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. No, no. It is true. He must be
a very fearful man! The militia have attacked
his band, and are still fighting with them. Our
soldiers too are sent out, and even the horse.
My father thought you would probably go out
against the robbers instead of him. I know
you will do it, and this it is that makes me so
uneasy. God knows what may happen! Perhaps
you will be brought back a corpse, and I
am sure I cannot survive you.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then you would rather that your
father would go himself?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Poor old man! Suppose he were
brought back a corpse&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Ah, heavens! It would break my
heart. Still I should have you. But were you
killed&mdash;my father is old, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. You can more easily get another
lover than another father.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. That is true.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Is it not?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. But not another Cinthio!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I thank you my dear Eugenia, for
your kindness&mdash;but what is to be done?</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Oh, that hateful, that accursed
Rinaldini!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. He is said to be a very handsome
man.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Alas! as for me I should think him
a thousand times handsomer were he hanging
between heaven and earth.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will make you a proposal. Instead
of Cinthio, let me go out against this Rinaldini,
and I will bring him to your wedding as
a marriage present.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Catch him if you can, you will get
plenty of money for him. But you may take it
all, I want none of it. If I can but keep my
Cinthio prisoner, I have all I want.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Oh, my dear girl!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. An excellent bride!</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Cinthio! Let your friend take your
place, since he is so willing.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Then he will get your father's
office.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. And then how shall we live?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. We must do as well as we can. If
we do but save both of our lives, that is all I
care for.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. And what will people think and say
of me? They will call me a coward. Would
you have such a wretch for your husband?</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Truly, that would be very sad.
What must be done?</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. I must go.</p>

<!-- page 94 -->

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Oh, I would rather die a thousand
times.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. But what will you say if I tell you
I am proof against both steel and bullets.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. I should bid you go.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Ask my guests.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Is it true?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I know nothing to the contrary.
He would have been dead long ago if it were
not.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. Ah, heavens! Oh, that it were
true!</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Be at rest. You will certainly see
me return as sound and hearty as I am now.</p>

<p>A musket was now heard in front of the
house, upon which they all started. Eugenia
cried,</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin! My heart whispers that Rinaldini
is here!"</p>

<p>Thus saying she sunk upon a chair, and Cinthio
and his friends seized their arms.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>BOOK VII.</h3>

</div>

<p>ALL now was silent; and Eugenia having
recovered her wandering senses, Cinthio came
to the door followed by the rest of the company;
but they could neither hear nor see any

<!-- page 95 -->

man, and though they went round the house, no
signs of any human being any where appeared.
As they were re-entering the house, however,
they heard some voices at a distance; but
these soon ceased, and all again was silent.</p>

<p>Cinthio sent Eugenia back to her father
with a message that he would go out for him
against Rinaldini; upon which Eugenia left
him, apparently very uneasy, and Cinthio remained
with his guests.</p>

<p>Nero was now sent out to the ruined castle,
but he sought in vain for Ludovico, till at
length, at the approach of night, he came back
without any intelligence whatever.</p>

<p>After an almost sleepless night, Rinaldo
himself repaired to the ruined castle, where
he ascended the platform, and anxiously looked
around toward the happy spot in which
were centred all his thoughts and wishes.</p>

<p>The sun arose in all the splendid majesty of
light, and began to illumine all the mountains;
the pinnacles and crosses that adorned the
towers of the castle already shone with the
ruddy morning rays, and upon these Rinaldo
fixed his eyes, till the mist cleared away, and
the valley became more visible. The sun now
glided through the blue ether unobscured; the
woods and vales seemed awakened to greet the
new-born day; and innumerable warblers poured
forth their songs of joy. But Rinaldo inclined
his head and fell upon his knee, overpowered
with the contending sensations of hope and fear,
of transport and despair.</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>"Whence, ah, whence," cried he, "these
strange emotions? What is it I feel? What
thus sinks me to the earth, and fills my heart
with sadness? Thy pure rays, alas! thou light
of worlds, pierce me inmost recesses of my
soul. O! annihilate me, and let me here expire
in the act of adoration."</p>

<p>After a long pause he raised his eyes toward
heaven and sighed, while with tears streaming
from his eyes he exclaimed, "Unhappy wretch!
here I wander in wildernesses and solitudes,
fearing every man I meet, and shunning the
very light of day. All my dreams are past,
and the dreadful hand of truth holds me in
brazen fetters. Oh, Rinaldo! what will be
thy end?"</p>

<p>He now heard footsteps in the forest, and
started up. Some firing succeeded, upon which
he seized his musket, and looking down perceived
Terlini and his comrades, who were flying
toward the ruins, pursued by several soldiers.
Having reached the castle they came
to close quarters, and Rinaldo's prudence forsaking
him, he fired upon the soldiers, who now
increased in numbers, and Terlini and his companions
being cut to pieces, Rinaldo was surrounded
and hemmed in by six men, to whom
he was obliged to surrender.</p>

<p>"I am a dead man," cried one of the soldiers,
"if this fellow is not Rinaldini himself."</p>

<p>Upon this an officer inquired, "Are you
Rinaldini?" and Rinaldo, scarcely knowing
what he said, sighed out, "Alas! I am."</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<p>A greater cry of joy now arose, and they
bound their prisoner's hands, and put fetters on
his feet. At length they began their march
toward the borders of the forest, during which
the soldiers were riotous and joyful; but Rinaldo
scarcely once raised his eyes from the
earth.</p>

<p>They encamped that night on an extensive
plain that bounded the forest. Here the officer
ordered some bread and wine to be given to
Rinaldo, but he partook of neither.</p>

<p>"You have not the courage," said the officer,
"to kill yourself. In your, place I would certainly
have done it; for how ignominious is the
death that now awaits you!" To this Rinaldo
made no reply, and the soldiers exclaimed,
"the fellow is sullen." "Ah," said another,
"he will soon find his tongue when he is put
upon the rack."</p>

<p>At this word Rinaldo shuddered, and a violent
emotion convulsed his whole frame, yet not
sufficiently powerful to break his bands. He
asked for a cloak, which was given him, and
having caused it to be thrown over him, he concealed
his face, while tears streamed upon the
grass.</p>

<p>"At length," thought he, "the hour of my
dissolution is come, and the transient scenery of
life is over like the passing shadow of a camera
obscura. Farewell, Rinaldo! Thy dreams
are dreams indeed! Thou art in bondage, and
Corsica still groans in chains. Away with me

<!-- page 98 -->

to the scaffold; such is my triumphal arch, and
the end of all my brilliant actions."</p>

<p>A few hours after they proceeded on their
march, and Rinaldo complaining of fatigue, he
was placed on a straw wagon, which was strongly
escorted. Thus he arrived toward evening
at Sardona, where he was to be delivered into
the hands of justice, and the following day to
be conveyed to Messina.</p>

<p>At midnight the door of his prison was opened:
the light of a wax candle darted into his
prison, and, to his utter astonishment, the old
man of Fronteja entered.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Heavens! What do I see?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Your friend.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you really the wise man of
Fronteja?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How came you here.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. By the power I possess.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Have you power to break chains?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I have.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then break mine.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Upon conditions&mdash;Why should I
not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Upon conditions? What do you
mean?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am not wholly disinterested.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then you are like the rest of the
world.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Not so much as you may imagine;
my motives justify me.</p>

<!-- page 99 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How much do you demand for my
liberation?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Much and little&mdash;as it may be
taken.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Speak.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You must give yourself up wholly
to me and my commands.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is much indeed.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I will save you from the rack and
the gallows.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That too is much.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. 'Tis unequalled. Without my
assistance you are lost. Do you still deliberate?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No&mdash;for I will rather give myself up
to the crows and worms.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You know not your own true interest.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Since it becomes not a philosopher
to be compassionate to an unfortunate like me,
tell me for what object you require me to give
myself up to you and your commands.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I stipulate for no particular cases.
We are treating generally, and in all cases.
Give yourself up to me unconditionally, and I
will rescue you from prison and from death.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am no machine. Good night.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. What ill-timed pride! You have
been nothing but a machine ever since you
began your celebrated career.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What say you?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You have&mdash;and that without
knowing it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Yes; a machine, and my machine&mdash;you
behold me with wonder: I repeat it,
you were my machine, are so still, and will continue
so as long as I please. On me and my
plans depend your destruction or salvation. 'Tis
true your misfortunes were not my work, but I
always knew how to save you, however frequently
you would have run yourself into
destruction.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I must not, cannot serve you more.
What is past has happened without my
knowledge or consent. Now I will be free;
and, if it must be, will freely die.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Even that you cannot do. You
will be tried before a criminal tribunal, and
there you cannot act from your own will.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I can strangle myself, or hold my
breath till I die.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. An expedient which many have
tried, but has succeeded with few; meanwhile
you may try it. Good night.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. One question more.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. What is it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If I have been your machine, am
so still, and must still continue so if you choose,
why do you require of me an express devotion
to your commands? Why do you need this if
I am already in your power, and am the plaything
of your caprice?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Be assured that was unavoidable,
otherwise it would not have been: besides, you
may easily imagine I am not much more simple
than yourself.</p>

<!-- page 101 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have never doubted your wisdom,
though I <i>have</i> the object of your errand: nor
can I deny I suspect the boasted greatness of
your power.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Of that you may think as you
please; out how then do you imagine I have
found my way hither through your guards, and
through locks and bolts?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Certainly not by witchcraft.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. That I have not said. But why
so many words? You will soon be carried in a
cart to Messina, where your arrival will afford
sport to the people, and much pleasure to your
acquaintance there. I doubt not a certain Dianora&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Silence, barbarian! You stretch
me on the rack without either law or justice.
Take me from this dungeon&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You know the condition.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, I will rather die.</p>

<p>Thus saying, he turned toward, the wall&mdash;the
old man went away, and the door closed.</p>

<p>The next day Rinaldo was taken from his
prison to be carried forward on his journey.
Meanwhile an officer of militia delivered him a
paper, which he requested Rinaldo, as soon as
he had read it, to return. It was to the following
effect:</p>

<p class="small">"You have stood the test. Doubt not the
assistance of your friend."</p>

<p>Rinaldo returned the paper, and was placed
in a carriage under a strong escort: they
travelled the whole day without stopping, and

<!-- page 102 -->

at sun-set entered into a narrow vale, of which
they had scarcely reached the middle when
some shot were fired on Rinaldo's escort from
a small distance on the neighbouring hills, and
soon after some men appeared, who fell on
the militia with a wild outcry. They fought
with fury; and this narrow valley seemed full
of combatants. Shot followed shot, and sabres
clashed against sabres, till at length the soldiers
were driven off from the carriage, the
mules were made to advance as fast as possible,
and presently some of the party sprang up
and unbound Rinaldo's bands. Two horsemen
brought him a led horse, which they desired
him to mount, and they instantly set off together
in a hard trot.</p>

<p>They advanced up the side of the mountain,
while the moon rose and illumined the rugged
paths, but without uttering a word, till they
came to a place overgrown with brambles,
where the horsemen slopped, desired Rinaldo
to dismount, gave him a portmanteau, took his
horse by the bridle, and, without saying a word,
galloped off.</p>

<p>In vain did Rinaldo call after them; they
made no answer, and were presently out of
sight. The sound of their horses' feet was soon
imperceptible, and Rinaldo remained in an
unknown place alone. He now began to reflect
on this singular adventure, convinced he
owed his preservation to the old man of Fronteja;
and, taking the portmanteau under his
arm, began to travel onward.</p>

<!-- page 103 -->

<p>When he had advanced some way he perceived
a light, and hastening toward it, came
to the lonely habitation of a hermit, who came
out to him with a lantern.</p>

<p>"Are you there?" cried he, holding the light
to him; "I was just coming to meet you."</p>

<p>"Do you know me then?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the old man of Fronteja?"
replied the latter. "Come, and pass the
night with me: then you will perceive that I
know you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo entered the hermitage, where he
found a frugal repast and a good bed. No conversation,
however, passed between him and
his host; and Rinaldo went to sleep somewhat
fatigued.</p>

<p>When he awoke he beheld the theosophist of
Fronteja by the side of his bed reading a book.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You have reposed long; and, I
hope, slept well&mdash;better than in your last
night's lodging.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where am I?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Among friends, with whom you
will stay till you can travel further without danger.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And whither?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. That must be the subject of deliberation.
You have had such a proof of my
power and of my friendship as your fortitude
deserved. You are free and unrestrained; act
as prudence and inclination may direct; and, if
you wish for good counsel it shall not be wanting;
but it shall not be forced on you. It may

<!-- page 104 -->

perhaps be requisite you should stay here a
fortnight, before you can pursue your route without
danger, and therefore some society has been
provided for you in your solitude.</p>

<p>As he said this he left the room, when immediately
Olympia entered, and hurried toward
Rinaldo with extended arms; but Rinaldo beheld
her in silence.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Will you say nothing to your
Olympia? have you no pleasure in again meeting
a friend who for you has voluntarily banished
herself to a desert?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I admire whatever you do.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. With admiration alone such a friend
as I am is not satisfied. I have a right to expect
more from you. You are rescued, and in a
place of safety, and you have not even thanks
to bestow upon your friends!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thank you with my whole heart
for my rescue; but does Luigino live?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. He does.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That I do not yet know.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where is Rosalia?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Probably with Luigino.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Probably?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I have no certain knowledge. If
she is no longer with Luigino he must certainly
have sent her to the old man of Fronteja.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are then Luigino and the old man
acquainted?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Why not? the old man knows us
all.</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But do we know him?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. At least personally.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is he still here?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. No: he went as I came in. He
knows you are in good hands.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whence this interest he takes in
the fate of a man who is persecuted by all the
rest of mankind?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. For that very reason; because
they persecute him.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is not the only reason.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Be it so or not, what is that to us?
'Tis enough that we are under his powerful protection.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is he really powerful?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Did you not experience that yesterday?
without his assistance you had been
lost.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Life is hateful to me!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. It will be otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Condemned ever to wander in solitudes
and forests&mdash;to fly mankind&mdash;to fear
every human being, and to hate myself; my
very existence is a burden to me!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Is Sicily the whole world? In the
fruitful vales of Corsica&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What hopes dost thou recall to my
mind!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That which you must not abandon.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, that dream!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Must be realized. In you I embrace
the deliverer of Corsica.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am not its deliverer yet.</p>

<!-- page 106 -->

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You must&mdash;you will be its deliverer.
Luigino depends upon your promise; we
all desire it; all your friends who know you,
and those who are your friends without knowing
you, reckon upon you as well as we.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Beware lest you reckon without
your host.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh, no. Learn too, that your
powerful protector the old man of Fronteja
reckons upon you. <i>He</i> is our host: he is a
Corsican.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Yes; he is a Corsican, as well as
Luigino. Your Olympia too is a Corsican.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. At Naples she was a Genoese.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. The times are altered; now I am
what I really am, a Corsican, and your most
tender friend. I do homage to you as the deliverer
of my country, and as the sole possessor
of my heart. But I must go and attend to our
little household concerns which call for my
presence, for we must not die of hunger.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was now alone, and began to reflect
on what had past: "Thus," thought he to himself,
"I have at length discovered, that amidst
all my fancied independence I am but a tool of
the real or pretended plans of an artful man.
But patience! Even he shall learn what I
really am. And yet, what can I do?&mdash;Is not
the part he would make me play sufficiently
honourable? Death is certain; and is it not
better to fall in the field of battle than on the
scaffold?"</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>Olympia interrupted this soliloquy, by bringing
in an excellent breakfast, concerning which
she seemed very busy, and appeared as though
she were born to be a housewife. Rinaldo
made a remark to that effect, at which she
laughed, but gave no other answer than "Much
good may it do you," and went out.</p>

<p>Rinaldo left his bed, dressed himself, and
took a hearty breakfast. Olympia soon returned
and kept him company: but she spoke only
of household affairs, and that with so much
minuteness, that Rinaldo himself was astonished
at her being so well acquainted with that
kind of business, of which he had imagined her
to be wholly ignorant. He endeavoured, however,
to turn the conversation to the subject of
which she had spoken before; but she only
repeated what she had already said, and observing
she must prepare for dinner, was about
to leave the room; Rinaldo, however, detained
her, and asked whether the noble Corsican
was to be nothing better than Rinaldo's cook?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Pardon me; much more. She
wishes to be every thing to the deliverer of
her country, and that includes both cook and
housekeeper. Princesses have set me the example,
and I am not ashamed of any labour I
perform from such honourable motives. When
the name of Rinaldo is engraved on marble, I
will write the name of his cook with charcoal
underneath, and add, "She supplied him with
food, that he might become to her native country
that which he proved her deliverer." 'Tis

<!-- page 108 -->

true your name will be more durable than mine
in the temple of fame, but I will renew it as
often as the rain obliterates it: and should my
tears fall upon the earth that covers thy ashes,
I will pray to heaven, "Oh, give him whom I
deplore, not these tears alone with which I
water his grave, but give him my whole self,
as I have given myself to him when alive."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Olympia, these flattering words
are&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh! speak it not. What I feel
must be answered by feelings, and not by
words.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Dreams leave no feelings behind
them.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. But the remembrance&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Beyond the grave?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I hope so.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And are you certain mine will be in
the vales of Corsica?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Where'er it be, oh, be it as late as
possible! and if it may be, near mine; for I will
never leave you more, till fate shall tear me
from you. My existence is connected with
yours by a powerful chain. I can die, but cannot
leave you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you think Rosalia is with the
old man of Fronteja?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. In safety she certainly is, and in
your heart also; nor can I ever drive her
thence. All I ask is the second place there&mdash;that
next hers&mdash;my request is at least as just as
my affection is true and tender. She is no Corsican

<!-- page 109 -->

and my heart is enfolded in my love for
my country. Will you unfold it? I will not
resist: no veil shall conceal it from you. Behold
and find it such as it is.</p>

<p>As she said this she reclined her head upon
his bosom, and throwing her arms around him
the big drops rolled down her beauteous cheeks;
they uttered not a word; she pressed Rinaldo
ardently to her bosom, then tore herself away.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Rinaldo with a sigh, as he communed
with himself, "so it is&mdash;I am destined
to be the sport of an old juggler, and of an artful
woman. 'Tis all concerted between them.
We shall soon see, however, how to act."</p>

<p>He now went out, and took a view of the
wild but confined scenery that surrounded him.
Meanwhile Olympia was very busy in the
kitchen, and sang as she worked in broken
stanzas, and with frequent pauses. This awakened
Rinaldo's fondness for music, and finding
a guitar, which was his favourite instrument, he
seated himself before the door, and sang a
mournful song he had composed on his wretched
prospects and condition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Olympia came out, and laying
her hand upon his shoulder, "Rinaldo," said
she, "sing such songs no more, or I shall die:
Cruel man! wherefore this self-torment?"</p>

<p>" 'Tis my song of repentance," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"No," rejoined she, " 'tis your destruction.
It robs you of your courage and your fortitude

<!-- page 110 -->

and changes you to a coward. In a moment of
danger you would lose your presence of mind,
and be subdued by your sorrows ere the enemy
attacked you. With such feelings you can
never lead the Corsicans to victory; thus self-subdued,
you will never fight the fight of
heroes."</p>

<p>"All I wish," said Rinaldo, with a deep sigh,
"is an honourable death."</p>

<p>"Alas! my wretched country?" exclaimed
Olympia, and hurried from him.</p>

<p>He continued for awhile lost in reflection, but
at length arose, and taking his guitar, climbed a
hill, where he reclined beneath an aged pine;
when casting his eyes over the prospect, he
perceived a man ascending the hill, and at
length approaching the hermitage, which he
entered, and immediately Olympia came to the
door and called Rinaldo, who found on his
arrival a messenger with the following letter:

<p class="small">"Your friends rejoice in your escape, and
revere your deliverer. Our numbers daily
increase, and we are already in treaty for some
ships. We shall meet where fame and honour
and the boldest of their countrymen await
you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo would have spoken with the messenger
but he was already gone. Immediately
after, Olympia brought in dinner, which was a
frugal though a good repast, and accompanied
with excellent wine.</p>

<p>Rinaldo passed three days in this solitude,

<!-- page 111 -->

wholly lost in thought, while Olympia was more
disposed to observe than to disturb him. She
therefore employed herself in writing letters;
which Rinaldo had no curiosity to read; though
they often lay open, perhaps not undesignedly,
before his eyes. She even received other
letters by a messenger to whom she delivered
those she had written, yet Rinaldo did not say
a single word to the bearer.</p>

<p>Toward evening on the fourth day, as they
were sitting before the door in perfect silence,
like husband and wife after a quarrel, a man
came from the valley toward their dwelling.
He was a handsome youth, and walking boldly
up to them, addressed them in these words;</p>

<p>"Peace be with you in the name of the old
man of Fronteja! I am one of his young
people."</p>

<p>As he said this he delivered a letter to Olympia;
and while she read it, Rinaldo inquired
"How is your master?" "As he is always,"
returned the stranger, "well, and anxious for
the welfare of his friends."</p>

<p>When Olympia had read her letter, the
youth complained of hunger, thirst, and fatigue;
upon which Olympia brought out some refreshments,
and prepared him a bed for the night.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was still sitting at the door, and had
lost himself in contemplating the firmament,
when Olympia returned, and thus addressed
him:</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I have received intelligence that
some friends from Corsica are arrived, and are

<!-- page 112 -->

with our friend at Fronteja. They are burning
with desire to become acquainted with you,
and will visit us a few days hence. I have the
more pleasure in telling you this, as my brother
is among these Corsicans, and will also pay us
a visit. Luigino has strengthened his party,
and has taken an advantageous position. Within
three weeks four large ships will be ready for
us, and every thing succeeds to our wishes.
The ever brave Rinaldo alone is not as he
ought to be. He holds back from the great
enterprise, and is lost in himself.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. When a proper occasion offers he
will be as he ought to be again.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh, that we could but hope! Rosalia
is at Fronteja&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she there?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Shall I write that you wish to see
her here?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I will do it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Why should I not? Perhaps&mdash;or
rather most certainly, her company will make
you gayer than mine; and so we shall all be
gainers. With the return of your cheerfulness,
your bold enterprising spirit will be awakened,
though your low spirits have laid it asleep.
Yes, Rosalia's presence will awaken it, she
shall stay with you here, and I will go to Fronteja.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And why?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You would not wish me to stay

<!-- page 113 -->

when Rosalia is with you? No, Rinaldo! my
heart is not so devoid of feeling as to bear the
presence of a successful rival without jealousy.
My absence will at least preserve your friendship,
and I will strive to conquer my passion for
you.</p>

<p>Rinaldo made no reply, and Olympia, lighting
a candle, wished him good night and left him.
Rinaldo now paced to and fro before the house,
then entered the room, came out again into the
open air, and continued till midnight almost in
a waking dream. At length suddenly starting
up, he took a light and hurried, unknowing
what he did, to Olympia's apartment, which he
softly entered, and, saw her in the arms of the
youth sent from the old man of Fronteja.</p>

<p>He returned equally unperceived; and at
day-break, before the youthful paramours were
up, Rinaldo took his musket on his shoulder,
and with hasty step quitted his abode.</p>

<p>Toward noon he reached a village, where
he rested awhile, and then proceeded on his
journey.</p>

<p>The shadows now began to lengthen, the sun
approached the horizon; and he doubled his
pace to reach a castle that appeared in view,
before night. This he accomplished, and
knocking at the door, found admission.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the porter.</p>

<p>"I am Baron Tegnano," replied Rinaldo,
"and have lost my way while I was out
shooting."</p>

<p>The porter made no reply, but fixed his eyes

<!-- page 114 -->

on Rinaldo, who asked "To whom does this
castle belong?"</p>

<p>"To the countess Martagno."</p>

<p>"To the countess Martagno!" said Rinaldo
hastily, "is she here?"</p>

<p>"No, she is not here," replied the porter.</p>

<p>"Who lives in the castle?"</p>

<p>"A female friend of the countess, Madonna
Violanta."</p>

<p>"Madonna Violanta! I know her, and she
knows me."</p>

<p>As he said this, he hastily entered the castle,
and went up stairs, where he met with a maid
servant, whom he desired to announce Baron
Tegnano to her mistress. But the slowness of
the maid not satisfying him, he passed her and
entered an antichamber.</p>

<p>On hearing the sound of his footsteps, some
one opened a chamber door, and he was met by
Signora Violanta.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Heavens! Baron Tegnano! Am I
really not mistaken?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are not, good Violanta.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Heavens! how came you here?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In consequence of wanting a night's
lodging.</p>

<p>Violanta was silent, but fixed her eyes on
him, then returned into the chamber. Rinaldo
followed her. She threw herself on a sofa,
and exclaimed in broken words, "Oh, let me
recover my wandering senses!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo now cast his eyes around the room,
and beheld the portrait of the countess hanging

<!-- page 115 -->

on the wall. "Is Dianora here?" exclaimed
he, "Ah no! 'tis, alas! but her resemblance."</p>

<p>Thus saying, he hurried to the picture, took
it from the wall, and kissed it with ardour. Violanta
beheld him in silence; while he, lost in
the contemplation of the beloved object, remarked
not the impression his conduct made on
the observant Violanta. After a long pause, he
approached her, seized her hand, and asked,
"Where is Dianora? Is Dianora happy?"</p>

<p>Violanta sighed and was silent, but Rinaldo
with increasing vehemence repeated, "Where
is Dianora? Where is my beloved Dianora?"</p>

<p>Violanta cast her eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she dead?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. She lives.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She lives! she lives! And well and
happy?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Ah, Baron, how can you ask?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I understand you, my misfortunes are
hers. And how could it be otherwise? You
know already&mdash;you know who I am?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. I have often seen you, baron,
and &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ah, call me by my true name, I
will not blush.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. By your true name! Is it not Tegnano?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What! know you not? Has not
the countess told you?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Told me what?

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Declare sincerely all you know of
me.</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p><i>Violanta</i>. That you are more loved than you
ought to be. That you have been false and&mdash;but
I am silent. If your conscience does not
reproach you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Violanta! I have saved you from
the dreadful shades of death, and have a right to
your gratitude; may I reckon upon it?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. You may.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then, I conjure you, tell me truly
how much has the countess told you?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. I know she loves you, and that you
have forsaken her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh! heavens!</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Your departure brought her almost
to death's door; she had a dreadful illness, and
the name of unfortunate mother ceased ere it
existed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where is she? Where does she
live?</p>

<p>Violanta was silent, but beheld him with a
wistful eve. Rinaldo, who, from her manner,
concluded that she knew where the countess
was, and that the latter had concealed his
true name from her, perhaps to spare herself
the shame a discovery of it would have brought
upon her, now became bolder, and employed
his eloquence to induce her to declare to
him where the countess was, but in vain. Violanta
eluded all his questions, or parried them
by other questions which might lead him from
the subject. In this, however, she could not
succeed.</p>

<p>While they were yet speaking, a bell, which

<!-- page 117 -->

hung in Violanta's chamber, was vehemently
pulled, on which she started up, took a key and
a light, and would have left the room. Rinaldo,
however, detained her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither are you going?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. That I must not tell you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither does that bell call you.
Ah! doubtless to Dianora.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. What then do you imagine?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That she is here.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. You are mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No, no. My heart assures me she
is here. You are going to her. Oh, tell her I
am here; that&mdash;no, I will go with you; I will
follow you; I must see her.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. The sudden alarm would kill her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Ha! you have betrayed yourself;
she is here then? Come, let us go to her.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. By all the saints of heaven! no.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She is here.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Yes, the secret is out, she is. But
you must not see her. She lives in silence, and
alone as a penitent. The sight of you would
destroy her.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh Violanta! If ever you loved, oh
let me but see her.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. I must not, cannot hazard it. Her
health is ruined, her nerves are weak and relaxed,
and your presence would strike her to
the earth.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can I not see her unseen myself?&mdash;I
will not speak to her if it must not be. Oh

<!-- page 118 -->

she is so dear to me! Her life is dearer to me
than my own.</p>

<p>The bell rung again louder and quicker.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Oh heavens! something may have
happened to her. Detain me not!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I must see her.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Resistless man! follow me, but
conceal yourself, and speak not a single word.</p>

<p>Violanta now led the way and Rinaldo followed
her along a gallery into a room, where
she placed him at a niche and left him.</p>

<p>Here Rinaldo beheld a room entirely hung
with black; and a table on which were a crucifix,
a death's head, and two lighted wax tapers,
which but feebly illumined the darkness
of the room. Pale and emaciated, a female
figure clothed in black walked to and fro. Rinaldo
perceived it was Dianora. Tears stole
from his eyes, his lips trembled, his hand shook
and his feet almost refused to support him.</p>

<p>Violanta entered the chamber, and approached
Dianora. Meanwhile Rinaldo listened to
what passed.</p>

<p>"Ah, where have you been staying?" said
she, reclining her head on Violanta's shoulder.
"I have been slumbering, and had a dreadful
dream. Methought he was here; the traitor
approached me, and covered my face with his
bloody hand. The blood ran from his hand
upon my bosom and my clothes, and burnt like
fire through all my members. The fright
waked me, and I thanked the holy Virgin that
it was but a dream. But this dream has taken

<!-- page 119 -->

a strong effect upon me. Ah, that I may never
see that unfortunate man again!"</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Never?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Never. Neither waking nor in
my dreams.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Did you not lately say you received
certain intelligence of his death?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. 'Tis true&mdash;and I believed it&mdash;and it
would be well it were so.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. If you do not wish to see him
again, believe it. But that is not so.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Oh yes! both for my sake and for
his.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. And for his?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Yes, and far more than my own,
for the unfortunate man is a traitor; and traitors
deserve death. And he&mdash;has long deserved
it. He has betrayed me, and his name
is&mdash;Ah! let us speak no more of him. It was
but a dream. He is still far away&mdash;He will
never return.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. But if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. No, no, he dares nor return. Nor
could I dare to hold any communication with
him, for he is a&mdash;traitor.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. But should his repentance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. His repentance can never uncommit
his crime. He is a great, a dreadful criminal.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Oh fear him not. Perhaps he loves
you still.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. But I dare not love him. Oh Violanta!
If you did but know&mdash;But enough! no
more of him.</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>Dianora now seated herself upon a sofa
and Violanta sat down beside her. After a
long pause, Dianora asked, "Have you nothing
new to tell me from the great world?"</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. Yes, something that has happened
very near us&mdash;in the castle itself.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. What is it?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. We have a stranger here, who has
begged a night's lodging.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. But he does not know I am here?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. No; we granted his request in consequence
of his noble appearance.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. And know you not who he is?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. He has not yet told us his name.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Beware what you do; you know
there are robbers about.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. He has no appearance of a robber.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Appearances are deceitful. Yes,
Violanta, appearances are very deceitful. Never
judge too rashly of the heart by the face. I
myself once&mdash;Robbers may disguise themselves,
assume names and titles, and&mdash;Be upon your
guard. Even the dreadful Rinaldini&mdash;Ah! heavens!
should he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. What ails you?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. My eyes!&mdash;Ah! my head&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. My dear countess!</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Peace! 'tis past&mdash;a dizziness&mdash;but
'tis gone. Ah! the dream! the dream.
Put me to bed.</p>

<p>Violanta went into an inner chamber, and
Rinaldo returned along the gallery to that of

<!-- page 121 -->

Violanta, where he threw himself upon a sofa
and gave a loose to his tears.</p>

<p>The door opened, and he endeavoured to
recover himself. A maid came in and said
"Sir baron, permit me to show you your chamber."
Rinaldo arose and followed the girl,
who conducted him to a neat room, where she
left him, but soon returned, and laying a cloth,
set out some cold meat, fruit and wine.</p>

<p>"Madonna Violanta wishes you a good
night," said the girl, and left the room.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, however, neither felt any appetite,
nor was inclined to sleep. At length midnight
arrived, but he was still up and heard a gentle
knock at his door. He listened for a while,
and heard a louder knock. Upon this he
opened the door, and beheld Violanta.</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said she as she entered,
"to find you still up."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh! you find me in a state of
restless agitation I cannot describe.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. You heard our conversation.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh yes, I heard it, and it has almost
destroyed me.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. What do you intend to do?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. She will certainly consent to see me.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. She has already.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed.</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. We have spoken long and much
of you as I put her to bed. I have by degrees
prepared her. In a couple of days, I hope
you will be able to see and speak to her.</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, Violanta!&mdash;How can I&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Violanta</i>. No thanks. I am indebted to you
for my life and deliverance&mdash;to-morrow we
will speak further of this: may the good
news I bring you procure you a night of repose.</p>

<p>She went, and Rinaldo remained in great
agitation. At length he was about to undress
himself, when he heard footsteps approaching
his chamber. They seemed the steps of a
man, and loud. They continued to approach.
The door opened, and a tall thin figure dressed
in black entered the room. A black mask
concealed his face, and a hood was drawn over
his head. He was girded with a knotted cord
and his feet and hands were naked. This
awful figure placed himself over against him,
and threatened him with his finger. Rinaldo
stood firm, placed his right hand on a pocket
pistol, and said, "Who art thou? What wilt
thou?"</p>

<p>With a hollow voice, the figure answered,
"I summon you to appear within four-and-twenty
hours before the tribunal of the strong
judge of truth: the judge of all crimes which
are committed in secret, but which are known
to him. If you come not you shall be fetched."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with persons unknown?"
said Rinaldo; "and who gave you a right to
call yourself my judge?"

<p>"Your crimes give it us, which give us a
right to judge all men."<p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Justice does not hide herself in night and
darkness."</p>

<p>" 'Tis well for you if we do not bring you out
to the light, where the sword of the executioner
awaits you."</p>

<p>"And with you?"</p>

<p>"Repent."</p>

<p>Rinaldo was silent and pointed to the door.
The man in black fixed his eyes on him and
said, "You will not come to us voluntarily?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Rinaldo, resolutely.</p>

<p>"Then force shall bring you to us."</p>

<p>"I will expect it. What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Experience shall tell you."</p>

<p>Thus saying, the figure proudly left the
room. Rinaldo took the light to follow, and
entered the antichamber, where he found the
door shut, and could not discover whither the
figure had so swiftly gone. He examined
every corner with the light, but saw nothing.
He listened, but nothing was to be heard.</p>

<p>Returning to his chamber, he perceived the
door of a closet in the antichamber to be
partly open, and thinking to find the figure
there, opened it suddenly, and saw a skeleton.
He started back, and the light fell from his hand.</p>

<p>He hurried into his room, fetched another
light, rushed with a pistol cocked to the closet
door, and found it locked. In vain did he
strive to open it, for it was shut as fast as
though it were a solid wall.</p>

<p>Uneasy and alarmed, he took up the fallen

<!-- page 124 -->

light, returned to his room, locked the door,
and went to bed.</p>

<p>He had no sooner risen on the following
morning, than he hurried to Violanta, who was
just leaving her room, and told him she was
going to Dianora.</p>

<p>"The countess is not well," said she, "and I
must not leave her to-day for a moment. Meanwhile
you shall not want any thing, and I will
come to you as soon as I can: though perhaps
that may not be till late in the evening, or not
at all. Be not uneasy however, and to-morrow,
perhaps, we shall see more of each other:
to-morrow, perhaps, you may even see and
speak with Dianora. Let us hope all will turn
out agreeably to our wishes."</p>

<p>Rinaldo, who was but little satisfied with
this promise, returned to his chamber. When
he arrived at the mysterious closet, he stopped
and examined it closely, but found it still shut
fast; and seeing several paintings on the walls
he also examined them, and perceived they
were a series of pictures representing some secret
history. In two of them appeared the
black judge he had seen in the night. In the
one he stood threatening with a poniard two
lovers who were embracing, and in the other
he was in a chapel, where he seized a young
lady by the arm who was praying and kneeling
before an altar.</p>

<p>The maid now brought in breakfast, which
disturbed him in his meditations.</p>

<p>"Have you any monks in the neighbourhood,"

<!-- page 125 -->

said Rinaldo to the girl, "who wear
black?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied she, "on the steep mountain
beyond the village is a monastery of Carmelites,
who wear black."</p>

<p>"Do any of them come here?" said Rinaldo.</p>

<p>"Three times a year," replied the girl, "the
alms gatherer comes to collect the customary
alms."</p>

<p>"Are then the Carmelites the confessors of
the castle?"</p>

<p>"No; the confessors of the Franciscans,
whose monastery is opposite us; with the
Carmelites we have no communication."</p>

<p>Thus saying the girl left him, and Rinaldo
went to the window more particularly to observe
the Carmelite monastery.</p>

<p>Time now began to hang heavy upon Rinaldo;
the day departed, and evening came;
yet Violanta did not appear. At length, however,
he received a note from her by the
maid, saying, "To-day we cannot meet: to-morrow
you shall hear more from me."</p>

<p>It was now night, and Rinaldo locked his
door. The black messenger of justice did not
come.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he arose, and was going
to Violanta, when the maid brought him a
letter from her to the following effect,

<p class="small">"I
have told Dianora you are here. She has confided
her horrid secret to my bosom, and I
know who and what you are. Leave the castle
speedily. We have also left it, and when you

<!-- page 126 -->

receive this, shall be many leagues off. You
will not find us; we have taken effectual
measures for that purpose. Fly and save
yourself. Should the strong judge of truth
discover your abode, he will not grant a long
day of liberty. Farewell, thou dreaded proscribed
man. May God amend, convert, and
protect you." VIOLANTA.</p>

<p>"Am I then everywhere," exclaimed Rinaldo,
"the sport of masks and disguises?
Must I everywhere hide myself in darkness?
Does love itself take his flight from my name
as from a crime? Away then with me, wretch
that I am, into the bosom of my mother earth!"
Thus saying he seized a pistol, cocked it, and
held it to his mouth.</p>

<p>His arm sank as though it had received an
electrical shock, and the pistol fell from his
hand. He turned suddenly round, and the
black figure was behind him. He threatened
with his finger, and left the room.</p>

<p>As soon as Rinaldo had recovered his surprise,
he took his musket on his shoulder and
left the castle. He entered a hollow way, and
had scarcely advanced a hundred paces when
the black figure met him and cried out "Appear."</p>

<p>"Where are you to be found?" said Rinaldo
with a resolute voice.</p>

<p>"To the right, on the height crowned with
poplars, you will find a chapel. There we

<!-- page 127 -->

are to be found," said he, and passed by Rinaldo
with tranquillity. Rinaldo proceeded on
his way.</p>

<p>"A mere trick of that old impostor of Fronteja,"
said he to himself: "whose machine I am,
as he has already told me himself. No; I will
not come: and if that raven of misfortune appear
again I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the black figure again, stood before
him, and said: "What then will you do?"</p>

<p>Immediately Rinaldo seized his musket
cocked it, took aim, and fired at him, but his
piece missed fire, and flashed in the pan.</p>

<p>The black figure laughed, and said, "Poor
marksman! fire at the crows, not at me. Attempt
it a second time, and I will crush you to
atoms."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou?" cried Rinaldo, raging and
beside himself; then threw down his musket,
rushed upon him, struck him in the breast, and
instantly felt himself seized with gigantic arms,
and thrown upon the ground so violently as to
take away his senses.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he found his head
bleeding, and the black figure had disappeared.
His rage deprived him of speech. He started
up, took his musket, and hurried with rapid
steps away.</p>

<p>He had scarcely gone thirty paces, when he
perceived by the road side, behind some bushes,
a poor miserable, ragged figure, who the
moment he saw him, cried out with all his

<!-- page 128 -->

might, "Ah! my dear, good noble captain!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo started, and approaching him, perceived
it was his faithful Ludovico, who instantly
endeavoured to rise, while tears of joy
flowed down his cheeks.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Heavens! Ludovico, how you look!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Dreadfully I know.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How came you into this wretched
condition? you look horribly.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. I am not only miserable and ragged,
but my whole body is bruised and torn to
pieces.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Speak. What has happened to
you.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. When you sent me into yonder
wood to reconnoitre round about the castle of
the countess Martagno, I was proceeding with
the utmost prudence, and learnt that the countess
was not there, but in another castle, which
was described to me, and to which I immediately
set off. I presently reached it, and was
scarcely a hundred paces from it, when suddenly&mdash;the
devil knows how he came!&mdash;a
black man in a mask stood before me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. As I tell you. He summoned me
in a commanding tone before the tribunal of the
strong judge of truth in secret; I laughed at
him, and as he was rough with me, I gave him
a box on the ear. But for this I paid dearly;
for the fellow attacked me with the strength
of a giant, knocked me down like a sparrow

<!-- page 129 -->

and buffetted me on all sides till I became
almost senseless. He then threw me like a
bird or a rabbit over his shoulder, and dragged
me to a chapel, before which he threw me
down like a wallet. The door of the chapel
immediately opened: two fellows in black
came out, dragged me in by the legs, and threw
me into a dark room. There I lay two days
on a handful of straw, with no food but bread
and water, and of that very sparingly. At
length I was taken out, and carried before
three men in masks, who sat round a table
covered with black, and surrounded by human
skeletons. They called themselves my judges,
and told me I was a villain and a robber, and so
forth. I thought it wisest to hold my tongue.
At length they said I had already too long deserved
a halter; that they would not hang me
for my past crimes, but, that I should be condemned
to a general penance. With this sentence
I was taken away and stripped by four
executioners, who flogged me till I was covered
with blood. This was repeated every day;
and the rascals laid on so unmercifully, that
their lashes almost went to my bones. At
length there was no more flesh for them to cut;
so this morning they turned me out of the
chapel. I have crawled hither, but can crawl
no farther.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How! And this penance I too was
to have undergone?</p>

<!-- page 130 -->

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. You! God protect you and all
men from it!</p>

<p>Here Rinaldo related to him what had.
happened to himself, and Ludovico crossed
himself with wonder, till Rinaldo at length
exclaimed, "Come, and let us set their nest
on fire."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words when
the black magician stood before him, and thundered
out to him; "Wretched worm! have
you not yet sufficiently experienced the strength
of my arm? Must I totally annihilate you?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo rushed upon him like a madman
with his poniard, but the black man eluded
him. Rinaldo collected all his strength, seized
him with his left hand, and with his right
struck his poniard at his breast. The stroke
gave a hollow sound, and Rinaldo perceived
be had struck upon a breastplate. He struck
again and pierced his arm. The black man
bellowed aloud, tore himself from him with
gigantic strength; pushed Rinaldo back so artfully
that he fell, and then with rapid steps took
to flight.</p>

<p>"Death and damnation!" cried Ludovico,
"what will become of us, if that sorcerer
brings his party out against us? They will
beat all our bones to a jelly."</p>

<p>Meanwhile they heard the tinkling of bells,
and saw a half a dozen muleteers coming down
the hill with about thirty unloaded mules, to
fetch salt from Saldona. When they approached,

<!-- page 131 -->

Rinaldo accosted them, and pointing to
Ludovico, asked if they would not let that poor
fellow, who had been maltreated by robbers,
ride on one of their mules, and he would pay
them himself?</p>

<p>"If you will pay for him, the man may
ride," said the chief of the party; "but he
might also ride if you did not pay, for we are
Christians and not heathens. Those rascals of
Rinaldini's band make a great number of unfortunates.
We have given assistance to a great
many more who lay upon the road, plundered,
naked, and half murdered."</p>

<p>Ludovico who was very happy to find himself
so strongly escorted, was tied on a mule,
after which the cavalcade proceeded, and Rinaldo
continued conversing with his new companions.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You talk of Rinaldini's band? Is it
not entirely exterminated?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. By no means. What is cutting a
couple of dozen of such fellows to pieces?
They grow up like mushrooms.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is not Rinaldini himself long ago
shot dead?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. Aye, that is the common cry; but
it is not true. Nor will he be so soon taken.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. Humph! Can't you guess? He
has a charm, that is certain. He is proof
against both lead and steel; and some say he
can make himself invisible. That, however, I

<!-- page 132 -->

will not assert; but it is certain they cannot
keep him when they have him. For if he is
taken, he is instantly at liberty again. He is
certainly a fine bold fellow, but I would not be
in his skin: for what will be the end of it?
By and by the devil will come and tell him his
time is out; there is the contract&mdash;march, come
along with me;" and so he will twirl him over
his shoulder in a twinkling.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You don't imagine&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. Yes, he has certainly a contract
with the devil, otherwise he would have swung,
and kicked the air with his legs long ago. But
after all he is a most unfortunate man. Of
what use to him are all the treasures of the
world, since his soul is damned? That is the
most valuable of possessions. If he cannot preserve
that treasure, I would not give a farthing
for all the rest. To live honest and die happy
is the best of fortunes. But with Rinaldini 'tis
a gay life and a miserable death; which is
sad fate. He cannot sleep so peacefully on his
coffers of gold, as I on my pack-saddles and
panniers.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis said, however, he is very benevolent.</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. The deuce take his benevolence.
He robs first and then gives away. I shall
never get any thing by him. God bless and
save my hard earned bread. I would not steal
or deceive any man, even to the value of a
farthing.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis true he pursues a miserable
trade.</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. He is always at hand, and comes
uncalled like crows watching for carrion. He
had better have learnt some other trade, for he
is no fool. Of robbers and their adventures he
must know enough; and God preserve all good
Christians from such knowledge!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. He himself does not steal any
thing.</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. But he makes others steal, and
that is as bad. In short, not a word can be
said for him; for he is a most desperate rogue,
and no one ever so boldly set justice at defiance.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How old may he be?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. Some say he is not six-and-twenty,
others thirty, but that is the utmost. He has
long been ripe for the gallows. I should like
however to see him once; but not to have any
thing to do with him as an enemy, for he has
too many accomplices.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where is his haunt now?</p>

<p><i>Muleteer</i>. No one knows. He is like Nobody,
every where at once. Sometimes he
goes about as a cavalier, lives in cities, and
gallants noble ladies about; but if search is
made for him, he is gone in an instant, and no
one knows where. He goes about the country
in fine clothes, and assumes every shape and
appearance. To-day here, to-morrow there,
and his band constantly surrounds him.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>Ludovico now perceived upon the hill the
chapel of the black men. He shuddered from
head to foot, sighed deeply, and gave his master
a significant look, upon which the latter turned
toward it, and seeing the chapel, understood
his meaning.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>BOOK VIII.</h3>

</div>

<p>"THAT chapel," said Rinaldo, "appears a
very old building."</p>

<p>"O, yes," replied the muleteer, "but not a
soul cares to visit it; for it is quite ruinous, and
has neither picture nor altar. It is probably
occupied by crows and owls, unless it may sometime
afford shelter to Signor Rinaldini and his
birds of night."</p>

<p>Rinaldo perceived, no information could be
procured from his new companions relative to
this place, and therefore said no more.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at Saldona, where
Rinaldo paid generously for Ludovico's ride,
and had him carried to some Jews, where he
clothed him anew. He then procured him
salves and plasters from an apothecary, nor were

<!-- page 135 -->

provisions forgotten. Having slept at the siesta,
and hired a chaise, they proceeded on their
journey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rinaldo examined his musket,
and found it uncharged; which explained the
reason of its missing fire at the black man.</p>

<p>"They have drawn the charge," said he to
himself, "at the castle, in order to maltreat me
with impunity. What! can Violanta have
an understanding with the black fraternity for
some object which may regard the countess?
Or would Ludovico have been so maltreated
had he not endeavoured to find out the countess's
abode? The pictures too in the castle,
in which the black figure appeared; the skeleton
in the closet, and those which Ludovico
saw at the black tribunal! Umph&mdash;All this
may lead to various conjectures. What if Dianora
herself were maltreated by a band of
villains who should conspire against her and
her property? Oh! that I were now at the
head of a score of my men! I would certainly
unravel this mystery."</p>

<p>Near Merona, Rinaldo and Ludovico descended
from their chaise, sent it back with the
driver, and took a by-road, where they, met
two men with some mules, whom Ludovico discovered
to be his old acquaintances Luzio and
Jordano, both of Luigino's band.</p>

<p>The mutual joy of meeting was great, and
they presently entered on a more particular
conversation, which Rinaldo began as follows:</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where is Luigino?</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. All we know is, that he has divided
his troops, half remaining with him, and half
under the command of Amalato. We were
among these last. Within six days we were
alarmed, and we and ten more were cut off;
since which we have never been able to join
the main body. In the meanwhile we act for
ourselves in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Have you a safe place to harbour
in?</p>

<p><i>Luzio</i>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Up to the ears in rocks and
forests.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will join you.</p>

<p><i>Luzio</i>. How?</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Are you serious?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As I have said.</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Thunder and lightning! 'twill procure
us both fame and fortune.</p>

<p>They now mounted the mules, and Rinaldo
joined the party, who now felt three times as
strong as they really were, in consequence of
having the dreaded Rinaldini at their head.</p>

<p>Rinaldo immediately gave his orders, sent
some of his men out to recruit, and others in
search of their old comrades; declaring to
them all that he was meditating a grand blow.
This made them proud and joyous, and <i>viva Rinaldini!</i>
resounded from all the rocks.</p>

<p>On the fourth day two more of Luigino's
men were brought in, who had been found

<!-- page 137 -->

straggling, and who were very glad to meet
with their companions. Three new recruits
were also admitted and sworn; and thus Rinaldo
was nineteen strong. With these men he
wheeled to the left, up the ridge of mountains
above Saldona, on whose left side stood the
chapel, against which he had sworn vengeance.</p>

<p>Rinaldo pitched his tent in an uninhabited
valley among rocks, and soon received proofs of
the courage of his people, who made rich booty
on all sides. Thus they wanted neither money
nor provisions. They also brought in two
footpads, who with great pleasure joined the
newly established banditti.</p>

<p>When they had procured the ammunition
they wanted, and Ludovico had recovered,
Rinaldo set forward with his party, took possession
of the pass of the mountain, and came
at midnight to the devoted chapel. Finding
the door fast, they immediately broke it open,
and searched the place by torch light; but
they found nothing but vaults and caverns, and
all was empty and void.</p>

<p>The speech of the muleteer was now fulfilled,
for Rinaldo took up his quarters in the
chapel.</p>

<p>The following evening he removed into the
valley below, and at the approach of night
marched against the castle of the Countess of
Martagno. When he had taken possession of
all the outer doors, and was about to enter the

<!-- page 138 -->

castle with Ludovico and Jordano, some of his
men told him they heard the sound of horses'
feet of a considerable party of cavalry. Upon
this Rinaldo drew his men together, and
wheeled to the left, into a wood which he
had scarcely reached, when the troops approached
it. His men were on the alert and
ready to fire, the dogs were silent and upon
the watch, when a number of burning torches
appeared.</p>

<p>" 'Tis strange!" said Ludovico: "a detachment
of cavalry never march by torch light."</p>

<p>The party still approached, consisting of
twelve horsemen, who surrounded a carriage
drawn by mules. Some bore torches, and all
were in black, and masked, exactly like the
black man who had maltreated Rinaldo and
Ludovico.</p>

<p>They were now very near the wood, which
Rinaldo quitted, and placed himself in the way
of the cavalcade with his gun cocked. Behind
him were Ludovico, Luzio, Jordano, and two
more of their companions ready to fire, while
the rest of the party enclosed them on their
right flank in a semicircle.</p>

<p>"Halt!" said Rinaldo with a thundering
voice; "here is one who would know who you
are."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" said the chief of the party,
"who is he that dares to command <i>us</i>? us
whom all men fear! us, whose power is dreadful?"</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>"Dreadful and powerful as you may be,"
said Rinaldo, "I have a name to oppose to you
that makes whole cities tremble, and a few
leaden balls will soon put an end to your power,
and the terror you excite. I am Rinaldini."</p>

<p>"He is not the man," replied the chief, "that
can frighten us; nor is he powerful enough to
threaten us with effect, since he himself is in
our power."</p>

<p>"You lie," cried Rinaldo with bitterness,
"Rinaldini is in no man's power."</p>

<p>"You fool!" returned the leader, "your
threats might soon be turned against yourself,
if you did not excite our pity; put at a proper
time you shall repent of it. The lashes of the
powerful ones fall heavy. Of that ask Ludovico."</p>

<p>"I hope," cried Ludovico, "to pay stroke
for stroke."</p>

<p>"Now," continued the black man, "it is our
turn to ask you, Rinaldini, why you place
yourself in our way? What would you?"</p>

<p>"Satisfaction," quickly returned Rinaldo,
"for unauthorized maltreatment practised toward
Ludovico and myself. I care not for
your pretended power. I will also know what
you are thus secretly conveying in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Of all that," replied the black man, "I
shall not say a word. We shall give no man
any account of our proceedings. Abandon

<!-- page 140 -->

your design and begin to repent, otherwise severe
justice will be executed on you."</p>

<p>Rinaldo made no reply, but gave a signal,
upon which his party hemmed in the cavalcade
still closer.</p>

<p>"One word more," said he, "and you are
dead men. Open the secrets of your carriage
voluntarily and surrender, or you shall pay for
your obstinacy with your lives."</p>

<p>"You may do as you please," replied the
black man, "but I will acquaint you with your
own danger: you are surrounded. On all the
heights arms are glittering to your destruction;
surrender to us on discretion, or your lives are
forfeited."</p>

<p>"Captain" whispered Jordano, "the heights
seem actually full of men;" and Ludovico in
their cant told him the same.</p>

<p>"The die is cast," replied Rinaldo; "we shall
not be so easily taken; certainly not without
bloodshed. Besides, the moment I give the
signal we shall cut our way through."</p>

<p>He now turned again to his antagonist, and
asked "For the last time will you surrender
voluntarily?"</p>

<p>"For the last time," replied the other,
"No."</p>

<p>Rinaldo fired his pistol at the black leader
of the party, and twenty more shot were fired
by his people. Three of the black men fell,
the rest drew their pistols and shot two of

<!-- page 141 -->

Rinaldo's men; then setting spurs to their
horses, they galloped off.</p>

<p>Rinaldo approached the carriage, and raised
the curtain, expecting to clasp Dianora in his
arms, but instead of a human being found a
coffin.</p>

<p>Jordano, Ludovico, and Luzio mounted the
horses of the killed, and now on all sides trumpets
were heard, and soon after the alarm-bell
was rung in all the villages.</p>

<p>"Quick," said Rinaldo, "quick with the
carriage to the mountain on the right." He
then vaulted on a horse which Ludovico
brought him, and galloped toward the pass
followed by Jordano and Luzio.</p>

<p>Ludovico and some of his companions sprang
on to the carriage and within. The rest kept
close together, and the whole party followed
their captain as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Rinaldo had scarcely reached the narrow
pass of the mountain, when he and his companions
dismounted and took post there, resolved
to defend this retreat to the last, but no opponents
appeared, and they were not attacked.</p>

<p>Soon after came the carriage, and by degrees
the rest of the party, who drew off toward a
more retired part of the mountain, and by break
of day reached a small valley, when they halted.
Both mules and horses were left to enjoy
the miserable herbage of the valley in liberty,
and Rinaldo mustered his people, of whom

<!-- page 142 -->

none were missing but the two that were killed.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now ordered the coffin to be taken
out of the carriage. It was extraordinary
heavy, and nailed down very fast, but being
forced open proved full of gold and silver vessels,
closely packed together, with plates, dishes,
mugs, goblets, and jewels; and two caskets
containing rings, watches, and six rolls of a
hundred ducats each.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Rinaldo, "now we know these
gentlemen. They are of our own trade, only
under a different appearance. This is the
cause of their hatred toward us. 'Tis envy
brings them out against us. 'Tis well they
have made a collection here, which we will
divide like the heirs of an old usurer."</p>

<p>He immediately wrote down the shares of
the distribution, and each had a considerable
sum. He himself only kept one of the horses
and two rolls of ducats; the rest of what was
due to him he gave up for half its value in
money.</p>

<p>Thinking it probable he might be pursued,
he divided his band, and pointed out to his companions
the road they were to take to the right
and left, in order by degrees to approach the
place wherein he imagined Luigino might be,
and whither he himself intended to go.</p>

<p>Every thing being now in order, he mounted
his horse, as did Ludovico and Jordano as his

<!-- page 143 -->

attendants, and all three took the great road to
Nisetto.</p>

<p>They had scarcely left the valley, when they
met an armed man, who placed himself in their
way: he delivered a letter to Rinaldo, who
beheld him with suspicion, and gave his attendants
the wink, which they understanding; dismounted
and seized the stranger, who stood
firm, without the least motion, or sign of fear.
The letter was to the following effect:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Courageous Rinaldini.</p>

<p>"Your fortitude and courage excite our admiration.
You have overcome us, and from
foes converted us into friends. We now
solemnly offer you our hands in an alliance
which you must not refuse; for it is the offer
of men who are sufficiently dreaded to make
themselves respected every where. Tired of
the yoke of a tyrannical government, we are
resolved to rule ourselves. You who deserve
to be at the head of an army, will take the
office that is so well adapted to you. We
would know where we may find you, that we
may communicate further by word of mouth.
You may confide your answer to the bearer
without the least suspicion; we expect it will
be conformable to our wishes.</p>

<p>"Your friends,</p>

<p>"The Black Judges in secret."</p>

</div>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>Rinaldo tore a leaf out of his pocket-book,
and with a pencil wrote,</p>

<p class="small">"Rinaldini desires
not to be more acquainted with you than he is
already. He is no rebel against his king, and
despises your offer. He will be able to punish
you, and will never suffer himself to be called
your friend."</p>

<p>He folded up the note, and silently delivered
it to the messenger, who received it in like
manner, and left him without uttering a word.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Rinaldo communicated
the contents of the letter to his companions,
and they were still speaking on this subject
when they saw a coach coming toward them;
in which, as it approached, Rinaldo perceived
to his utter astonishment, Olympia sitting beside
a stranger, who, from the attendants, appeared
to be a person of rank and condition.</p>

<p>At the sight of Rinaldo she turned pale, but
gave no signs of knowing him; and when he
bowed to her returned his salutation with great
dignity and distance. Rinaldo stopped one of
the servants, who was some way behind, and
asked, "Who the gentleman might be?"</p>

<p>"The mayor of Nisetto," said the servant.</p>

<p>Ludovico looked at Rinaldo, and said laconically,
"So we did not choose to know yonder
lady, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Rinaldo
laughing, "otherwise we should have acted in a
different manner."</p>

<p>"The mayor," said Ludovico, "will soon

<!-- page 145 -->

find her out; and who knows whether, when
he once knows her thoroughly, he may not
repent of having made her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Very possibly."</p>

<p>"I must confess the signora falls into a great
variety of hands; but, suppose she were to
come into the clutches of the black men, and
they should inflict on her a penance for knowing
us, like that I experienced. They have
written the whole calendar on my back in my
own blood, and it would be a pity to impress so
many red-letter lines on the signora's delicate
body as they have on mine. Yes, yes, if I ever
forgive the villains their cruelty, I will confess
myself a fool and a coward."</p>

<p>He was still going on with this oration, when
Jordano observed that a great cloud of dust appeared
before them, which seemed to arise
from a body of horse. And so it proved; for
at length the cloud approached, and the troops
came in sight; upon which Rinaldo ordered his
men to prepare their arms, and rode directly
toward them.</p>

<p>In fact it was a body of dragoons that were
come out against him. The officer returned
his salutation with the utmost politeness, and
said; "May I ask your name?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo answered without hesitation or delay,
"I am a traveller, by birth a Roman, and my
name is Baron Tegnano. These are my servants."</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>"Doubtless, you have a passport?" said the
officer.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Rinaldo readily, "and letters
of recommendation from the mayor of Nisetto,
whose relation I have the honour to be."</p>

<p>"That is all perfectly right," returned the
officer, "otherwise you would be stopped
wherever you meet any soldiers, which you
will very frequently."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How happens that? Is there any
danger from the Barbaresques?</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>. We are too far from the coast for
that. But there are a great many robbers
about, and Rinaldini with his band is in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So I have heard, but I scarcely believed
it.</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>. 'Tis true, however. And besides,
there is another set of thieves; but nobody
knows whether they belong; to Rinaldini's band
or not. They wear black monks habits, and
so make themselves much feared. I am glad
to see you and your people are so well armed,
otherwise I would give you an escort. Even
a military body run some hazard in engaging
with such a banditti, for they fight like desperadoes.
You are going to Molano?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>. I wish you a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>Thus
they took leave of each other.</p>

<p>Ludovico observed, "We got off very
luckily. I was in a terrible fright lest he

<!-- page 147 -->

should ask to see our passports and letters of
recommendation."</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. So was I. And what would you
have done if he had?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Ay, let us hear what you would
have done, captain!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. For that I was prepared.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Well.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I would have taken out my pocket-book,
turned over the leaves, looked for the
papers, and seemed much disturbed at not finding
them. "I have left my papers, behind
me," would have been my answer, and I
would have proposed to go back to Nisetto to
the mayor. There we should have found
Olympia, and you do not imagine she would
suffer any evil to befall us.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Bravo! I should not have hit upon
it so soon, and yet I flatter myself I have
my share of shrewdness. You deserve, indeed,
were it only for this, to be our captain.</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Yes, by heavens! that is true. I
am very happy I am in your service. Perhaps
I shall gain by it in various ways.</p>

<p>They now trotted on fast: not to Molano, as
Rinaldo told the officer, but turned off to
the left toward the mountains, where about
noon they reached a small village. Near it
was a monastery, which served as an inn for
travellers, and at which they stopped.</p>

<p>While their frugal dinner was preparing,
Rinaldo enclosed the letter he had received

<!-- page 148 -->

from the black fraternity, to the mayor of
Nisetto, and sent it by a messenger accompanied
with the following letter:

<div class="small">

<p>"<i>To the Mayor of Nisetto</i>.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;The enclosed letter from a black fraternity
is sent you by the man whom it invites
to enter into a conspiracy against the lawful
government of this island. He has no inclination
to hold any communication with these
men; and informs you of this set of banditti,
who hide themselves in dark places. You
will know what measures to take. The banished,
dishonoured, and despised robber-captain,
is no rebel; he has renounced his way
of life, and will soon be no more in this island.
He wishes you all health and happiness.</p>

<p>"RINALDO RINALDINI."

</div>

<p>Having arranged this business, he gave
himself up to the contemplation of the romantic
spot before him. The inn was at the foot of a
high mass of rock, on a peak of which stood a
beautiful castle surrounded with high walls,
and adorned with numerous towers. It reminded
him of the castle of Martagno, and recalled
the remembrance of the days that were gone.</p>

<p>Wandering about the foot of the rock, lost
in silent contemplation, he approached a bush,
from behind which a fellow suddenly rushed
upon him, threw him down, bound him and

<!-- page 149 -->

dragged him behind the bush. Here upon a
signal given, a trap door covered with turf
arose, and Rinaldo was dragged down some steps
through a dark passage. A flight of steps, and
another trap door, brought him up again to day-light,
and he found himself in a large court of a
castle. Here his bands were loosened, and he
was suffered to recover breath.</p>

<p>He inquired where he was, but only received
for answer, that time would inform him.</p>

<p>On the stairs he was met by a kind of warden,
who gave him three keys, saying: "These
are the keys of the three apartments appointed
for your residence in this castle."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Apartments?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. Yes apartments.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And not dungeons?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. God defend us from all the dungeons
of this castle; they are horrible. But
why should a prison receive the noble Baron?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you know then who I am?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. I know nothing more of you, than
that I am ordered to attend on you, and that
you are a noble Baron, with whose name I am
unacquainted.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In whose castle am I?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. That I dare not tell you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Through whose means am I here?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. I know not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Tell me all the instructions you have
received relative to me.</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. To lodge you in the three rooms I
have mentioned; to wait on you and to keep

<!-- page 150 -->

you company whenever you wish it, but not
otherwise; my wife is to wash and cook for
you, and for the rest I am to wait further
orders.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And may I not know the name of
the proprietor of the castle?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. Not from me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Am I then a kind of state prisoner?</p>

<p><i>Warden</i>. That may be. I know not why or
wherefore you are brought hither.</p>

<p>Rinaldo said no more, but desired to see his
apartments, which were very neatly furnished.
He found pen, ink, and paper, books, and even
a guitar, which showed that whoever had
ordered him to be brought there, knew his mode
of life.</p>

<p>The view from his apartment was beautifully
romantic. He went to a window to enjoy it,
and a telescope increased the pleasure he received.</p>

<p>He saw also the inn he had stopped at, and
his companions, Jordano and Ludovico, who
were searching about with great anxiety, and
could not discover any traces of their master.
He halloed and made signs, but his voice was
sent back by the rocks, and his signs were unobserved.
He then wrote a paper and gave it
to the wind; but it whirled in airy circles round
and round, till at length it was caught by a
hawthorn near the castle.</p>

<p>He now began to reflect on other means of

<!-- page 151 -->

attracting the attention of his companions;
when he saw some men on horseback arrive at
the inn. They surrounded Ludovico and Jordano;
a firing was heard, sabres glittered, and
both parties soon disappeared in a cloud of dust
that moved toward the left. It seemed that
Jordano and Ludovico were carried off, and the
place was void of any appearance of men.</p>

<p>The departing sun left Rinaldo pensive at
his window, and there the moon and stars still
found him.</p>

<p>Three days had now passed, and the evening
of the fourth was come, when, as Rinaldo
sat upon his couch, the door opened, and a
female figure in a veil suddenly appeared. She
stood still near the door; and Rinaldo having
contemplated her during a few moments in
silence asked, "Who is there?"</p>

<p>She approached, came close to the couch
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Do I know you or not?"</p>

<p>"You do."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"How can I? Yet I suspect."</p>

<p>"Then who am I?"</p>

<p>"Olympia."</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You have guessed right.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How came you hither?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. As you came.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By force?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Not so, but by the same road.</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You know then the private ways
of the castle?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Not yet. 'Tis the first time I have
been here.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What wilt thou?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Can you ask? I am come to see
you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can you then leave the mayor?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You see I can.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But will he not be jealous?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. He is a good-natured man.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. So much the better for you.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And for you also. He is one
of us.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is to say he is a machine of
the old man of Fronteja?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. The same.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Bravo!</p>

<p>Olympia now took a seat by Rinaldo, who
burst out laughing.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What diverts you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Many things.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That is no answer to my question.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Answer me first.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What do you ask?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Wherefore am I here?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. For your own safety.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Who ordered me to be seized and
brought here?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Your friend.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The old man.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. The same.</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To whom belongs this castle?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. To one of our friends. Were you
not here you would be in a dungeon. Ludovico
and Jordano are probably now in fetters. The
black fraternity are, as you know, very powerful.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You know then that they persecute
me?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I know it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What! And do not the black fraternity
also belong to your party?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Not to my knowledge. If so, how
could they be your enemies?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis all a masquerade, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And why?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To raise the merit of the protection
you pretend to afford.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That is a joke we have no need of.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then who are these blustering
scoundrels?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What you have said; yet they are
very powerful by means of their secret bonds of
union.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are they more powerful than the
old man of Fronteja, and they who devote
themselves to him?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. No; but yet they are very powerful.
Meanwhile your letter to the mayor has
given them a powerful blow. It is now in the
hands of government, who are besides very
watchful of these men. A little more and

<!-- page 154 -->

they will be utterly destroyed. But of that
you will hear. Now for my message to you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What is it?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I am to ask you whether you are
still resolved to go to Corsica?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You have but to command your
machine.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. We would hear your determination
from your own free will.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then I am not your machine?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You are free. The old man leaves
you to your own free will. Even should you
determine not to go to Corsica, you may leave
this castle as soon you please, and go where
you please.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I take you at your word.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You may do so if you choose.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I do.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Then you will not go to Corsica?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. When I have spoken with the old
man, and with Luigino, I will explain myself
more fully.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And not to me?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Then good night.</p>

<p>Thus saying she arose, went toward the
door, stopped, and seemed waiting for something.
Rinaldo wished her a good night's rest.
Upon this she came back; and seized his hand
but Rinaldo drew it back. She continued
standing.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you want any thing more?</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I have more to say to you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then say it.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. It is something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Unpleasant?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. More than unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Be it what it may, I must and will
hear it.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Your dear Rosalia is ill.</p>

<p>Rinaldo sighed, but made no answer. Olympia
waited in vain for a reply, and again went
to the door, and stood still.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Have you no commands for Rosalia?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A thousand good wishes for her
recovery.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. But, suppose she&mdash;Rinaldo! Rosalia
is very ill.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh heavens!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Should she die&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis no enviable fate to be the
paramour of a proscribed robber captain.
What happiness could the poor girl rationally
expect here upon earth? to see her lover upon
the rack, herself exposed in the pillory, and
condemned to perpetual imprisonment in a
house of correction, for having loved him?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Rinaldo! You forget the laurels
that flourish for you in the vales of Corsica.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. These are no bridal chaplets for a
girl, nor do they really flourish for me. That
venerable plant, formed for the brows of victorious
and triumphant emperors, will never cool

<!-- page 156 -->

the temples of a robber. On my forehead the
laurel itself would fade, and posterity would
think it a satire on every hero it ever graced.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Unfortunate man!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now you call me by my true name.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. What will, what can become of
you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Alas; it is too easy to guess.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. You are dispirited. How will all
this end?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As it must end.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Alas! Can you speak thus? Resume
your fortitude, and be what you ever
were&mdash;a great man.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Shame not the truly great by such
a parallel.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. History will inform you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No comparisons! no examples! I
know what I am.</p>

<p>Olympia was silent, and covered her face
over with her veil. Rinaldo beat his forehead,
and sighed deeply.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Rinaldo! Rinaldo!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Rosalia is very ill?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I must not deceive you; she is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Dead?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Dead.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Farewell, dear girl! 'Tis well for
thee that thou art no more! Olympia!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Rinaldo!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis well for her, is it not?

<!-- page 157 -->

'Twere well for me, were I too dead. But
yet a little while&mdash;</p>

<p>Rinaldo turned to the wall and wept, and
Olympia left the room. At length he threw
himself on his coach and slept.</p>

<p>A noise awoke him from a horrid dream.
He, perceiving a strong light in the room, and
rubbing his eyes, saw a table set out with wax
candles, bottles, and glasses, at which Cinthio,
Nero, Ludovico, Jordano, Luigino, Olympia,
and Eugenia, were sitting, with a candle before
each guest. Rinaldo beheld them in silence,
as in an optical exhibition, while they not perceiving
he was awake, proceeded with their
conversation.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. They had already handcuffed us,
and began to talk of horrid things, for example,
of the rack, of beheading and hanging, and the
like. This made us somewhat uneasy, and we
imagined we were about to end our lives amid
the cruellest torments, when assistance unexpectedly
arrived.</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Ay! We shall never forget the
old man of Fronteja. Come let us drink his
health.</p>

<p><i>All</i>. Success to the old man of Fronteja!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. He has also frequently rescued
our brave Rinaldini from the hands of justice.
Yes, he would long since have been food for
crows, had not the friendly old man interposed.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That is true. Rinaldini is indebted

<!-- page 158 -->

to him for his life in various ways. He
ought to be very grateful to him.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Certainly. My friend Rinaldo is
not ungrateful. 'Tis a great pleasure to me to
have become acquainted with the good old
man and his worthy friend Olympia. There
was I, forester of a trifling bailiwick, when the
only luxury I experienced was to kill a badger
or a wild cat, to avoid starving. But now
we shall hunt the proud and insolent French.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Perdition seize them! Long live
the brave Corsicans, who are expecting our arrival,
and that of their deliverer.</p>

<p><i>All</i>. Long live the brave Corsicans!</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Perdition seize the French!</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. How long may it be before we can
join our countrymen?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. At the utmost a couple of months.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Were it but a couple of days, I could
scarcely wait so long to salute them.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. But how strong are we?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. We shall embark above four hundred
strong, and shall find in Corsica above
three thousand friends, besides those who will
join us as soon as we shall have struck the first
blow, and occupy some tenable position. Fort
Ajalo will be first taken.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. And the French garrison must be put
to death.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. They must. We must make
ourselves feared. Thunder and lightning,
there will be a terrible alarm when it is known

<!-- page 159 -->

that the invincible corps of Rinaldini is there.
They are very devils to their enemies, and the
most generous of mankind to their friends.
They shed their blood for the liberty of the
injured and oppressed Corsicans. Yes, my
friends, 'twill bring us fame and honour. Already
do I see our names shine upon the obelisk
of fame that will be erected to us and our
victorious arms; and posterity will say, "Behold
the deeds of men who have been called
robbers and banditti. Behold their names in
letters of gold, and at the head of them that of
Rinaldini.</p>

<p><i>Nero</i>. Will our old man go with us?</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Undoubtedly. He too is a Corsican,
and has the good of his country much at
heart.</p>

<p><i>Eugenia</i>. And will all the ladies at Fronteja
go with us?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. All. Many of them will fight beside
their brave companions, with manly courage
and patriotism. Others will weave chaplets
for the victorious combatants, and their
kisses will reward every act of heroism.</p>

<p>A tall handsome man, with a noble air, now
entered the room. Luigino called him Astolfo,
and Olympia gave him the appellation of
brother. He sat down, and another wax candle
was lighted and set before him. His glass
was filled, and the conversation proceeded.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Well! How are we? Is the castle
full?</p>

<!-- page 160 -->

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. Oh, that it were full of enemies to
the French! We are ninety strong already.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Oh, that we were already arrived
in Corsica! Yes, the cutler, or gunsmith,
whose weapon first destroys a Frenchman,
will be so dear to me, that I will pay for ten
masses for his soul, and all his family shall sing
a <i>de profundis</i> when he dies, with wax candles,
at my expense.</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. Early in the morning at the latest,
Amalato will be here with his thirty men.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. Where is Malatesta with his party.</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. He is coming round by the mountains
of Tolona. He is gone out once more, in
pursuit of the black fraternity.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. God reward him! If he can but
exterminate that cursed band!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I doubt not you often remember
these black men in your prayers?</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Oh, yes! the cursed scoundrels!
They have made so deep an impression on me
that I feel it in all my nerves and limbs every
time the wind changes.</p>

<p><i>Jordano</i>. Yes, they handled you very roughly
indeed; you must think of them every new
moon.</p>

<p><i>Ludovico</i>. Every time the wind changes, I
tell you. They stamped a perpetual almanack
on my hide; I feel it in every vein whenever
the cock crows. But the first time any
of them come within my reach, I will pay them
handsomely. Yes, their flesh will be so cut to

<!-- page 161 -->

pieces, when the crows come to feed on them
that they may tear it off without trouble.
Hark ye, I feel such a rage against these black
gentlemen, that I would load them with all the
mortal sins of the world, and with all the pests
of the Levant.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was still listening to the conversation
while the goblet went gaily round, when
the door opened and the old man of Fronteja
entered. They all arose from their seats, and
saluted him with the greatest respect. He
gave them a friendly nod, sat down, and joined
in the circle. Two wax candles were placed
before him, and his glass was filled.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Pure as the wax and flame of
these candles, is the view of all those who are
here assembled together; resolved to tread
the soil of a country which, when manured
with the blood of its tyrants, will yield us a
rich harvest of fame. We sow and reap for
the oppressed. We are the husbandmen of
fame and justice. We come to burst the chains
of a brave, an unhappy, and an enslaved
nation.</p>

<p><i>Luigino</i>. 'Tis true.&mdash;We come to save
them.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. The day of vengeance and salvation
is nigh, and a new sun rises upon Corsica.
Spirit of the noble but unfortunate Theodore,
appear to the friends of thy country
which thou lovedst, and would'st have saved!</p>

<p>As he said this he raised his hand above his

<!-- page 162 -->

glass, and suddenly the wine began to hiss in it
like fermenting must. The bubbles rose high
up, and leaving the rim of the glass, formed a
pyramid, changed to a mantling cloud; burst in
the air, and became a vapoury indistinct appearance
of a man. The lights became dim; the
form hovered over them clear and transparent,
high above the table like a cloud, then disappeared.
The lights again brightened, but the
form was gone. The company sat in speechless
astonishment, and the old man drank off his
glass to the memory of King Theodore.</p>

<p>They were all still sitting in silent expectation,
when the old man turned toward Rinaldo
and asked him, "Have you nothing to say
to your friends?"</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Much good may it do you all.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Is that all the interest you take in
our vast design?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. All I can do is to wish you well.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Has the great, the aspiring wish
to become the saviour of Corsica forsaken you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your enterprise is in very good
hands.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Do you renounce the fame you
would acquire by participating in this just and
noble achievement?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I renounce every attempt at a species
of fame which becomes me not. No palms
of honour can grow for a captain of banditti.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Mean-spirited man! you are no
longer the bold intrepid Rinaldini; your soul is

<!-- page 163 -->

gone from you; you are scarcely the shadow of
your former bravery. Oh, my friend, could but
your former instructor, the worthy Onorio hear
you, what would he say? How would he deplore
your present condition? What can we do
for you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If you are really my friends, forget
even that my name is Rinaldini. With that
name connect no expectation of brave actions,
and let me die in peace unknowing and unknown.</p>

<p><i>Cinthio</i>. Rinaldo! My friend!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I pity you who have been torn from
your peaceful solitude! You were too happy
for a robber, and therefore your happiness has
ceased.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I pity <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Give me some proof of your friendship.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. What proof do you desire?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Procure me, thou all powerful man!
a safe retreat from this island.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Whither?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To some other small unnoticed
island, where I may find room for myself, and
grass for my goats. There will I end my life
in peace, amid shepherds and fishermen, unknowing
and unknown.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. How is that possible? you are
known to all the world.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Not in every part of it. I bequeath
you my buried treasures, and will tell you where

<!-- page 164 -->

they lie; they will aid you in your projected enterprise.
Let some ship bear me over the
waves, and along the shores of the land whose
chains you are about to break.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You are ill, my friend: We
cannot suffer you to be out of our sight till you
recover.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Will you be my physician? If so,
be as compassionate as your brethren, and give
me an early grave.</p>

<p>As he said this he covered his face, and the
company remained totally silent. The old man
gave a sign to Astolfo, who left the room, but
perfect silence still prevailed.</p>

<p>At length drums were heard in the castle,
and trumpets rent the air; upon which all the
company started up, and "We are betrayed,"
was repeated on all sides. Rinaldo too sprang
from his couch, and seizing his sabre hastened
to the door. Here the old man embraced
him, and cried out with transport, "Yes, you
are still the intrepid, the courageous Rinaldini.
The beat of drums, and the sound of trumpets
have awakened you from your lethargy, and
the man again appears. These sounds shall
accompany you to Corsica, and the thunder of
our cannon shall proclaim to the enemy, that
the avenger is come."</p>

<p>Rinaldo beheld the old man with concern
and agitation, and his sabre fell from his hand.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried he, "you know the game you

<!-- page 165 -->

are playing with me; but I do not know my
own heart."</p>

<p>The old man gave him a significant look, and
said, "We have but awakened what was
slumbering within you. Now we know you
are still the brave Rinaldini. Trumpets and
drums may be silent, but your soul speaks,
louder than your mouth. What you may say
when dispirited and cast down, we believe
not; we know what sounds restore you to
your friends. That which the voice of friendship
could not effect, the sound of the trumpet
has brought about. This is the call of honour.
Now we know you are the hero we
sought for."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You are mistaken. I will seek my
death in battle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. No man seeks it who wishes to
live with shepherds and fishermen, surrounded
by his goats. Such only seek to shun danger
while the truly bold meet it with undaunted
front.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Despair is not bravery. It converts
cowards into lions.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. 'Tis enough, Rinaldo! we know
you.</p>

<p>On a hint from the old man, the rest of the
company silently withdrew one by one, without
noise; and at length the old man himself quitted
the room saying, "We leave you to repose."</p>

<p>Rinaldo again threw himself upon his couch,

<!-- page 166 -->

and the remembrance of the scene that had
passed since the time of his awakening, played
upon his senses like a dream.</p>

<p>On the following day, Rinaldo did not leave
his room, but remained alone and undisturbed.
The day after, when he wished to speak with
Cinthio, he received for answer, that he was
no longer at the castle. Upon this he desired
an interview with the old man of Fronteja, but
he also was no longer there. Presently after
came Astolfo, to whom Rinaldo declared his
desire to quit the castle.</p>

<p>"That depends on your own free will," replied
Astolfo; "however I do not advise you
to it, as you had better be accompanied by
some of our party. The black fraternity are
every where watching for you, and while alone
you are always in danger of being exposed to
their unlimited revenge. Our party are going
by degrees to the coast, where they will embark
and sail for Corsica; for we must lose no
more time in teaching the place of our destination."</p>

<p>Rinaldo appeared thoughtful, but soon recovered
himself, and said, "Have you seen a
young woman at Fronteja named Rosalia!"</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. I saw her ill and dying.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is she really dead?</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. As certainly as we two are alive.

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A natural death?</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. What would you say? If you suspect
anything, your suspicions are unfounded.

<!-- page 167 -->

The old man loved her as though she were his
own daughter.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And yet he has not said a word of
her death to me.</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. That is his manner. He does not
willingly speak of the dead.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Rosalia was very dear to me.</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. 'Tis so said. I also shall leave the
castle to-morrow. If you will go with me you
will have protection. We are all going by degrees,
as we have told you, to the coast.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are you really Olympia's brother?</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. I am.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A Corsican?</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. The same.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is Luigino also gone?</p>

<p><i>Astolfo</i>. He is.</p>

<p>Here they were both silent, and Astolfo at
length approached the door; when Rinaldo
turned himself suddenly round and said, "I will
leave the castle with you to-morrow."</p>

<p>Astolfo rejoiced in this resolution, and left
the room.</p>

<p>The next morning Rinaldo mounted a horse,
and departed with Astolfo. Here and there
they met with several of their party upon the
mountains, divided into small troops, though at
no great distance from each other. They had
very little conversation, however, on the road.</p>

<p>In a few days they reached Sutera, where
they rested a few more, and then took the direct
road for Syracuse. They left that city on

<!-- page 168 -->

their left, staid a couple of days at a villa, which
seemed to belong to an acquaintance of their
party, and then travelled toward the plains of
Marsala.</p>

<p>Here they again took up their quarters at a
villa, from which Astolfo made a day's excursion
alone.</p>

<p>On his return he said, "Here you may remain
in peace and safety, till we call you to
embark. Should the time seem long, go sometimes
to the mountains of Sambuca, where you
will find a party of our people encamped. I am
now going to the old man, and hope to see you
again soon."</p>

<p>Astolfo set off, and Rinaldo found every thing
he could wish for at the villa. A gardener and
his daughter were his inmates and attendants,
and some servants of the Corsican fraternity
came to and fro.</p>

<p>The gardener's daughter, whose name was
Serena, seemed a good-natured girl, and became
Rinaldo's companion both at home, and in his
solitary walks. In her, he beheld as it were a
second Rosalia, and became so accustomed to
her company that he could not leave her. She
amused him with little tales of ghosts and
knights, and sang not only various ballads she
knew before, but several which Rinaldo composed
to please her.</p>

<p>In these mutual and simple delights, one day
chased on another with so much rapidity that
Rinaldo had been three weeks at the villa ere

<!-- page 169 -->

he reflected how he came there and whither
he was going.</p>

<p>Once as he was sitting with her in an arbour,
he remarked, that during the two last days she
had appeared less happy than usual. She replied,
"It may be so; but it is my father's
fault."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Your father's?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Yes; he told me you would not stay
here long.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And does that distress you?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Certainly; I am now accustomed to
you. We ought to make no new acquaintances,
since we must always at length be parted.
In my opinion, when two people form a
friendship and like each other, they should
always continue together.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And do you like me?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. I thought you must long since have
perceived it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But how do you know whether I
like you?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. I think so, because you always desire
to have me with you. We do not love the company
of those who are disagreeable to us. But
that is not the case with you; for whenever I
am absent from you an hour or two, you always
call, Serena, where are you? And then I hear
your call with so much pleasure, I have sometimes
even contrived to be thus called by you
on purpose.</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But of what benefit can it be to
you that I like you?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Very great. It makes me gay, and
happy, and cheerful, and light-hearted.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But since I cannot remain here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. That is very sad! Where then are
you going?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Away from this island to another
country.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Is it a pretty place?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh yes.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Is there another Serena there who
likes you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Perhaps I may find several.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. If you have to seek them, why not
stay here where you have already found one?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have duties, ties, business.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. I am sorry for it. When you go I
shall be very unhappy.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You will soon be gay and cheerful
again, and all will be well.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Oh no! by no means. Do but stay
and all will be well indeed.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. That is very sad. And will you not
come back?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis improbable.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Were it even a year. I could endure
it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My dear girl! you know not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Indeed I know not much, but I may
be able to learn perhaps, a great deal more;

<!-- page 171 -->

and besides if <i>you</i> will be my instructor&mdash;Ah!
what would I not readily learn of you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Learn then to forget me when I
am gone.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. That is impossible. No, it cannot
be. That I know already. We can never forget
those we love.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you love me then?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. Alas! yes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That is not well.</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. How could it be better? Who can
forbid my loving you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What can you hope from such a
passion?</p>

<p><i>Serena</i>. To be loved by you in return.</p>

<p>A messenger now came in, and delivered a
letter to Rinaldo. It was written by Cinthio
who amicably reproached him for not having
yet visited his friends on the mountains; and
invited him to come speedily. Rinaldo wrote
an answer, promising to comply with his request;
and as soon as he had despatched the
messenger, went to the sea-coast, where he
found some fishermen in the bay loading a
boat with provisions. He approached, and entered
into conversation with them.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Where are you carrying these
provisions?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. To Pantalaria.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To Pantalaria?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. Yes; do you not know that
island?</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How should I? Is it far off?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. Only sixty miles; a mere stone's
throw.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Is it very populous?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. Except a small town and castle,
there are not three hundred inhabitants; for it
contains only two small villages and a few country
houses. The whole island is surrounded by
barren rocks; but within these it is very beautiful
and luxuriant. In the midst of it is a most
fruitful valley, and the hills are cultivated to
the summit. It abounds in corn, wine, oil, and
oranges: and what the island does not produce
we carry them.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Are not the inhabitants very
poor?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. They are indeed far from rich,
but very industrious and benevolent. What
they want most is money; a piece of gold is
so uncommon with them, that it passes for a
curiosity. From time to time, however, they
dig up ancient coins, of which they make money
in Sicily. They spend very little, and a few
pieces of silver lasts them a long time.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. These good people seem to live
quite in patriarchal simplicity.</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. Simple enough. There is but
one church on the island, except the three
in the town.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But yet they are very pious,
people?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. Oh yes; there is a convent of

<!-- page 173 -->

St. Clare in the town, and a small monastery in
the country, where six Franciscan monks reside.
More could not be maintained there; but these
trade with our island, and carry over what they
want.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I should like to see this little
island.</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. That you may easily do. You
have but to go over with us. We will take
you for a reasonable price.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. When do you go?</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. To-morrow, two hours after sun-rise.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will accompany you.</p>

<p><i>Fisherman</i>. But you must be here in time,
for we cannot wait.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Fear not: I will come early enough.
Here is something for earnest, and to-morrow
we shall meet again.</p>

<p>Thus he returned home in a firm resolution
of going to this island of Pantalaria, from which
he intended never to depart.</p>

<p>"There," said he, "perhaps I shall at length
find a peaceful asylum amid the pure uncorrupted
sons of nature, and thus prepare myself
in tranquillity and repentance, for the kingdom
of heaven."</p>

</div>

<p>THE morning dawned, the harbinger of a
bright and cheerful day; when Rinaldo thus
poured forth his prayers to the Creator,</p>

<p>"Grant that I may now find the long desired
repose! Turn not from the repentant sinner,
but permit me to find a peaceful retreat amid
the worthy, and the honest of my fellow creatures!"</p>

<p>Rinaldo now sprang from his couch, and taking
with him his linen, his gold, his jewels, and
his arms, sighed out a tender farewell as he passed
the chamber of Serena, and hastened to the
bay, where the fishermen expected him.</p>

<p>"You have kept your word," cried they as
he approached, and then shook hands with him
in a friendly and cordial manner.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready?" said one of them, and
being answered in the affirmative, folded his
hands together in prayer. The rest followed
his example.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, whose eyes overflowed with tears,
sighed and prayed also.</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy on a robber, who turns
unto thee, and prays for a safe passage to that
land of tranquillity, for which he has so long
panted! Oh, punish not these innocent men for
having taken on board their bark a sinner who

<!-- page 175 -->

can in no place fly from thy justice! If thou
wouldst punish him at least punish not these innocent
men for his sake, but conduct them safely
into port, and permit them to reap the fruit
of their industry! Oh turn not thine eyes from
yonder, peaceful island nor punish its fields
with barrenness, nor let thy thunders fall on
its guiltless cottages! Accept my repentance,
and permit me to live among good men, and
become good myself!"</p>

<p>Their silent prayers being ended, they embarked.
One of the fishermen steered while
the others plied the oar to the measure of a
song, and the barque ploughed the open sea,
which was sweetly illumined with the morning
sun.</p>

<p>Rinaldo stood up to contemplate the coast of
Sicily, which continually receded from his eye.
The mountains diminished into hills, houses
and towers became points, and all the various
scenery of nature melted into a blue undistinguishable
mist.</p>

<p>The fishermen were gay and happy, continually
joking and laughing, or singing songs,
while Rinaldo listened to them with pleasure,
and requested them to repeat those which particularly
pleased him.</p>

<p>They were now becalmed, so that the fishermen
were compelled to ply their oars without
intermission, and even Rinaldo lent his assistance,
which greatly pleased them, and induced

<!-- page 176 -->

them to pay him some handsome compliments.
Toward night they perceived the
lights in the castle, and a fresh breeze drove
them toward the east coast of the island,
where they entered a bay and dropped anchor.</p>

<p>At day break they came on shore, and were
presently surrounded by the inhabitants who
crowded to them from their scattered dwellings,
and from a neighbouring village, to see all
the fine things that would be offered to sale.
The fishermen pitched a tent, and the scene
presented by the numerous buyers and sellers
became extremely animated. Men, women,
and children hastened to the tent, and several
musicians joined the throng; upon which they
began to dance and sing, and pleasure smiled
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Rinaldo withdrew from this noisy mirth to
an olive grove, where perceiving a beautiful
little cottage about two hundred paces farther,
he approached it.</p>

<p>He there found a cheerful industrious woman
pursuing her rustic labour; and asked her for
a small draught of milk, which she cheerfully
gave him; but when he offered to pay for it,
refused to take any money. Rinaldo pressed it
upon her and she accepted. Pleased with his
generosity she set out some figs, raisins, and rice-cakes
and thus they fell into conversation, in
which the good woman was very communicative
and free.</p>

<p>On Rinaldo inquiring after her husband,

<!-- page 177 -->

"Ah! Holy Virgin!" exclaimed she, "he has
been buried these two years, and left me to do
all myself, with three children to maintain.
Two of them are boys, one seven years old, the
other five, and the third a girl nine years old.
The neighbours assist me in my little farm, and
I am fresh and hearty, and will go on working
till my children are able to take care of
themselves, if God pleases to give me health and
strength, and when I can work no longer they
may take care of me."</p>

<p>Rinaldo made her more and more communicative,
and having thus secured her interest and
good will, began to declare his plans and his
wishes.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I like this place very much.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. Aye truly, 'tis a very pretty
place. We do not live indeed in luxury, but
Heaven has kindly given us all we want. I
never knew a scarcity of provisions but once in
all my life, and then we were supplied from
Sicily. We felt our misfortune indeed very severely
while it lasted; but it is now eight years
since, and we have almost forgotten it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. A thought has struck me. Suppose
I were to stay with you a couple of
months?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. That you must determine, sir,
yourself. You know best whether you can
make it agreeable.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The air is good and pure, the sky
is clear, and why should I not be happy here?

<!-- pages 178 and 179 are missing from the 1848 edition;
the text is supplied from the 1832 edition. -->

Besides I am free and unrestrained,
and may live where I please.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. Well, sir, you can but
try; and if you do not like to stay, you
can easily return to Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With all my heart&mdash;But
where can I take up my quarters?  Shall
I live with you?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. It is my wish.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. I have two empty rooms
in my house where you may lodge.  They
are at your service.  But I tell you beforehand
you must behave well, or I shall
call in the neighbours, and you will come
off very ill.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My good woman, you shall
have no cause to complain of me.  I shall
live quiet and alone, and will assist you
in your work.</p>

<p>Martha (for that was the woman's
name,) now conducted her new lodger
into the house, and having shown him a
small room of which he approved, the
bargain was presently struck.  Rinaldo
paid her two months in advance, which
she immediately laid out with the Sicilian
fisherman, in corn and meat.</p>

<p>Rinaldo declared his resolution to the
fishermen, who expressed great surprise
at his plan.  "Well," said one of them, "we
shall return in a few weeks, and then we
shall hear how you like the island.  If it
does not please you we will take you back,
for Sicily will always be Sicily, and, compared
with this island, it is even more
than a paradise."</p>

<p>Rinaldo stocked his new dwelling plentifully
with wine and other provisions, and
as his shipmates were to sail the next day,
he determined once more to metamorphose
himself.  He therefore cut his long
hair round like the country people of Pantalaria,
and dressed himself exactly as a
native.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, he undertook various
labours in the garden, the vineyard, and
other household affairs.  "I should never
have imagined," said Martha, "that a
great gentleman like you could have been
so ready at our country business&mdash;And
then to see you in our country dress both
pleases and surprises me.  And one would
swear you had been born and bred in the
island."</p>

<p>"Believe it yourself," replied Rinaldo,
"and you will do me a great pleasure."</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. Well, well, that is a pleasure
I can easily do you.  We believe a great
many things that are not more probable;
and besides, I know no reason why I
should not believe it.&mdash;But tell me how
you learnt to be so clever at work?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I was always very fond of
such employment.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. It must be so, otherwise you
could not possibly be so handy.  Are you
not a Sicilian?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No. I was born in the Italian
part

<!-- page 180 -->

of Switzerland; where my father had an estate.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. And did you not inherit it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. My brother paid me a sum of money
to give it up, and I have been travelling to see
the world. But this island pleases me so much,
that I am inclined to pass the remainder of my
life here.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. Do so. Get a house and flocks of
your own, and take a wife, if you are a single
man.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I am free; but heaven knows how
long I may continue so.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. Only let me beg I may choose for
you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. With all my heart; at present,
however, I will stay with my good friend Martha.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. The neighbours will indeed jest a
little, but that signifies not. We have both of
us clear consciences.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. In this respect we have.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. And in others too, I hope! At least
I have! Have not you?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. (<i>confused</i>.) Why not?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. If not, be not offended&mdash;but I would
not willingly live under the same roof with you.
Bad consciences bring ill luck to a house.</p>

<p>This speech made a forcible impression on
Rinaldo, who broke off the conversation and
resumed his labour.</p>

<p>Having remarked that Martha went out
every evening with a large milk pail, and was

<!-- page 181 -->

absent about an hour from home, Rinaldo one
day asked, "Whither she went so far with her
milk?"</p>

<p>"I carry it," replied she, "to a villa that lies
yonder behind the wood."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To whom does the villa belong?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. To a gentleman of the town.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And does he live there?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. No. For about six weeks past a
couple of ladies have resided there, who are
said to have come from beyond sea. But no
one knows who they are, for they live quite
private and retired, and have no communication
with their neighbours. I have only seen them
once myself. An old woman servant always
takes my milk and pays me. I once asked her
who the ladies were, but she told me she knew
not. The ladies, she said, were foreigners, and
she is a native.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do the neighbours know any thing of
them?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. Nothing. Very few indeed know
they are there.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do they never go out?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. I asked that question once, and the
old woman told me they went out sometimes
into the garden, and once to the chapel upon
the mountain.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. 'Tis strange!</p>

<p><i>Martha</i>. There must be some mystery in it.
Who knows what they may have done, that
they are obliged to conceal themselves so closely.

<!-- page 182 -->

They must either be guilty of murder or
theft.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If they are pretty, they may have
stolen hearts, perhaps.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now formed a resolution to see the
ladies, and on this object bestowed all his exertions,
but in vain. He wished not to excite
the observation of the neighbours, and yet
could not otherwise accomplish his intentions.
He therefore offered to carry Martha's milk
for her, to which she readily consented, hoping
thereby to learn something more concerning
the ladies.</p>

<p>Thus Rinaldo visited the villa, and entered
into conversation with the old woman.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Neighbour Martha is not well to-day,
and has asked me to bring her milk for
her: I know not, however, to whom I am
bringing it, or who is to use it.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. I will take it of you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. But you do not use it all yourself?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What, have you children?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. God forbid! I never had any.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Then it is for your master or
mistress?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. Something of that kind.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have my supper in my pocket;
will you permit me to eat it here?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. I am not forbid to consent to
that.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I have worked very hard to-day

<!-- page 183 -->

and am very tired, and will therefore take a
little Syracusan wine.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. Syracusan wine! How did you
come by that?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I bought it of the Sicilian fishermen.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. But is it not very dear?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh no. And then it tastes deliciously.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. That I believe. But poor people
like me must not meddle with it. The ladies
I serve only drink water and chocolate.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed! Would you like a glass?</p>

<p><i>Old Woman</i>. If I may make so free.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Why not? I never offer any thing I
do not mean. Come, drink.</p>

<p>She had scarcely emptied the glass when
the bell was rung very loud. "That is on your
account," said she. "Go, and promise to come
again soon."</p>

<p>She now left him, but immediately came
running down stairs, and exclaimed, "Oh Holy
Virgin! one of the ladies has fallen down in a
swoon. What shall we do? She lies for
dead."</p>

<p>Rinaldo did not stop long to reflect, but
sprang up stairs, and through an antiroom into
the chamber where the ladies were, and beheld
one of them kneeling beside the other, who was
just recovering from a fit; and Rinaldo remained
unseen at the door.</p>

<p>The lady who was kneeling, now stood up,

<!-- page 184 -->

and perceiving Rinaldo, screamed and said,
"What do you want here?"</p>

<p>Rinaldo approached her, and discovered to
his utter astonishment Violanta and Dianora.</p>

<p>Violanta did not as yet clearly recollect him
through his disguise, and Dianora, who presently
came to herself, observed there was a stranger
in the room, and asked who he was. Rinaldo
stood speechless, but his eyes were fixed
on Dianora.</p>

<p>Violanta observed him attentively, and anxiously
exclaimed, "Friend, whoe'er you are,
whatever chance has brought you hither, let us
not behold that face. Leave us instantly."</p>

<p>"On no consideration in the world," replied
Rinaldo.</p>

<p>Violanta contemplated him more closely, and
at length screaming, exclaimed, " 'Tis he himself!"</p>

<p>" 'Tis he himself!" repeated Dianora, and
covered her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dianora!" cried Rinaldo, "shall not the
chance that has brought me here determine in
my favour? Will you turn away your eyes from
me, whom fate has thus wonderfully brought to
this island, as it were expressly to meet you?
Oh be not more cruel to me than fate itself!"</p>

<p>After a long pause, Dianora uncovered her
eyes, and said, "Unhappy man! Why art thou
here? Is it not enough that your image everywhere
pursues me, must you also thus persecute
me yourself?"</p>

<!-- page 185 -->

<p>"Chance," replied Rinaldo, "will have it
so, and I am happy! Happier in the little island
of Pantalaria, than I could be in the great
world!"</p>

<p>The old woman now came in with water.
Violanta went up to her, took her by the hand
and led her into the anti-chamber.</p>

<p>Rinaldo being now alone with Dianora, he
approached her, and seizing her hand fell upon
his knees. She cast her eyes upon him with
tender grief, and sighed. He moistened her
hand with tears, covered it with kisses, and
pressed it to his palpitating heart. Dianora
wept bitterly, and her bosom heaved beneath
the flowers that adorned it. Her cheeks
inconsciously reclined downward, and glowed
against those of Rinaldo. Their lips seemed
to attract each other involuntarily, and Rinaldo
exclaimed aloud, "This kiss of forgiveness, this
heartfelt seal of pardon purifies me from my
errors, and confirms me in a new course of life.
You see, my dear Dianora, I am cut off from
the noisy world, and have fled to this little
island to live in tranquillity and solitude. Yes,
Heaven itself approves my pious resolution.
My prayers are heard. I am forgiven, and
providence has sent you to meet me upon the
path of divine reconciliation. You are once
more mine, and we shall now begin a new life."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rinaldo!" said Dianora, sighing,
"soothe yourself not with these flattering
hopes. Let not these delusions fill you with

<!-- page 186 -->

such sweet but fallacious hopes, which can
never be realized."</p>

<p>"You cannot rob me of this strong conviction,"
replied Rinaldo. "You yourself are the path
that leads to the accomplishment of my hopes,
and what I here embrace is no vision, it is the
sweetest of realities. Thus is my good fortune
renovated in your arms."</p>

<p>As he said this, he laid his head upon her
bosom and tenderly embraced her. Dianora
was unable to utter a word, and the scene was
the more expressive in proportion to its
silence.</p>

<p>Violanta found them in this situation, and
passed into an inner room. Dianora now gently
pushed Rinaldo from her. He arose, and
stood with his eyes fixed on those of Dianora.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Rinaldo! What mean those inquiring
looks?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Does not your heart tell you? Has
Heaven given you to me again that I may
again abandon you?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Ah, Rinaldo! How can I, how
ought I to answer that question?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. As your heart prompts you.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. No, we must not now listen to such
partial counsellers.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whom then should we consult?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Reason and reflection.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. These too are partial.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Ah no!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh, shun these cold advisers, that

<!-- page 187 -->

can never make us happy. Heaven has
separately pointed out to each of us this land
as an asylum, let us thankfully acknowledge the
value of the gift and enjoy it.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. But whither would all this carry
us?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Whither but to happiness, through
our own hearts!</p>

<p>Violanta now returned, and said, "If you
would not wish that Rinaldo's stay should excite
notice even in our old servant, he must go
away without delay."</p>

<p>"Oh Violanta!" said Rinaldo, "you have
never loved or been separated from the idol of
your heart, nor ever found again the object you
had lost, and enjoyed the bliss of an unexpected
and happy meeting, else your lips could never
have uttered so dreadful a command."</p>

<p>"Let Dianora herself determine," replied
Violanta.</p>

<p>Dianora beheld him with tenderness, and said,
"Oh yes, Rinaldo, indeed you must leave us for
the present."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And never see you more! You will
leave this island&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Assuredly no?</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. At least not without me.</p>

<p><i>Dianora</i>. Not without you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Now then I will go if you desire it;
and to-morrow shall I see you again?</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p><i>Dianora</i>. To-morrow.</p>

<p>He again tenderly embraced her, and departed.
Violanta accompanied him to the
door, and, inconscious of his steps, he hurried
back to his rustic retreat.</p>

<p>The next morning at sun-rise, Rinaldo's hostess
was already in the field, and Rinaldo stood
with panting heart before the villa where the
beloved object of his heart resided. He walked
around the happy spot, yet knew not why
he dared not enter it. At length the solitary
chapel caught his eye, whither he had been
informed Dianora once went to pray. Impressed
with this reflection, he went there; threw
himself on his knees before the saint, and
poured forth his soul in prayers and devotions.
At length he perceived the sound of footsteps
behind him, and starting up beheld Dianora.
He sprang toward her, pressed her to his bosom,
and exclaimed&mdash;"Our hearts have once
met and found each other, and now our souls
pursuing a like course, meet in the same pious
object. I have been praying and adoring, and
will not disturb the devotion of your spotless
soul. Pray also, and let me taste of happiness
through the acceptance of our joint petitions."</p>

<p>Thus saying, he led her to the altar, where
she knelt down, and Rinaldo left the chapel.
He also fell upon his knees beneath some lofty
cypresses, and raising his hands toward heaven,
prayed in silence, and with a flood of tears.</p>

<p>In this situation Dianora found him, as she

<!-- page 189 -->

returned from the chapel, and softly approaching
him, reclined over him, embraced him
tenderly, and kissed his forehead, which was
warm with the fervour of his devotions.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rinaldo," cried she, "surely you are
now become a good man. Very consoling and
encouraging were my prayers. The saint, methought,
smiled acceptance on my petition, and
a sweet tranquillity filled my heart. If heaven
has received you into favour, how can I reject
you? My heart is yours; love will neither rob
us of our peace, nor leave us without consolation."</p>

<p>Rinaldo accompanied her to the villa, where
the old woman was informed that this peasant
in disguise was a relation of her lady, whom
chance and his love of solitude had brought to
Pantalaria. The same story was related to
Martha, who equally wondered and rejoiced at
the discovery.</p>

<p>Every thing now assumed a new form. Rinaldo
was no longer the inmate of Martha, but
removed to the villa, where the whole house
underwent a new arrangement.</p>

<p>Rinaldo now inquired of Violanta the true
cause of the sudden departure of the countess
from the castle, where the black man first
appeared to him; and learnt with astonishment,
that a dreadful menace from the same black
personage, had determined her to that measure.
Thus they reciprocally cleared up the
mysterious appearances relative to the black

<!-- page 190 -->

fraternity; and they both agreed, that the real
obscurity of this business consisted in a conspiracy
against the state; and that they only desired
to employ the dreaded robber captain as
a machine tor the completion of their plans:
the true object of which was equally secret, as
the existence of the plot was certain. Violanta
had already formed an opinion that the black
fraternity might secretly pursue the same object
with Rinaldini, and that it was incompatible
with that object to permit him to renew
an acquaintance, which might frustrate their
intentions.</p>

<p>Rinaldo felt no inclination to puzzle himself,
about a mystery which had little connexion
with his present situation, and thought himself
but too fortunate in the present, to bestow his
thoughts on past scenes which he was desirous
to forget. He now stood like an altered man,
in a circle formed around him by love and
friendship, and lost sight of objects that excited
painful remembrances. Neither the scenes of
violence and plunder in the Appenines, nor in
Calabria and Sicily could engage his thoughts.
All had passed away like a vision or a drama,
in which he had performed a part, but which
he had now forgotten, or at least was desirous
to obliterate from his memory. He wished he
had ever lived as he lived now; but whenever
his thoughts returned to past scenes, it was to
those of youthful happiness, when in rural solitude
he tended his goats at pasture.</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>Being the youngest of the family, it fell to his
lot, when scarcely ten years old, to tend the
goats of his parents, who lived in no small degree
of poverty. This patriarchal way of
life, however, had not so many charms as to
prevent him at a more advanced age from being
desirous of changing his mode of life. He
was very eager of knowledge, and felt a strong
inclination once more to assist his brother in
the vineyard, or the field. This led him to
seek the society of a hermit, who lived in the
neighbourhood of the spot where he drove his
goats to pasture. The hermit, whose name
was Onorio, had not always worn his present
solitary dress. He knew mankind, was a man
of an acute understanding, and had fled from
the world, because, as he said, he had learnt to
despise it.</p>

<p>This man readily undertook the task of instructing
the inquisitive youth: became his
tutor in reading and writing, communicated to
him a great deal of knowledge by conversation,
and supplied him with books, which Rinaldo
devoured in solitude. They consisted of
translations of Plutarch's lives, Livy, and Quintus
Curtius, books of knight errantry, and the
Italian historians. All these books gave a romantic
turn to the imagination of Rinaldo, and
had a striking influence on his plans and resolutions,
as well as on all his actions.</p>

<p>He was seventeen years old when his friend
and instructor Onorio suddenly disappeared,

<!-- page 192 -->

leaving a writing, in which he made Rinaldo
heir of his little property. Rinaldo converted
it all, except the books, into money, and enlisted
as a soldier. Here he hoped to realize the
romantic ideas impressed upon his mind, but
in vain. The machinery of an heroic life was
not to he found in the papal troops, which he
therefore quitted and entered into the service
of Venice. Nor did he continue in that long,
but enlisted in the army of the king of Sardinia.
Here fortune seemed to smile upon him. A
general officer noticed him, promoted him to
be corporal, and at length he was sent as ensign
to Sardinia, to garrison Cagliera. Here
an occasion arose, in which he violated the
laws of subordination, and was broken. This
enraged him so much, that he revenged himself
on his superior officer, like too many of his
countrymen, by the stiletto, and took to flight.
Thus being publicly accused of his crime, and
finding safety nowhere, he wandered through
Italy an outcast from society, and destitute of a
place of rest.</p>

<p>At length he joined the band of robbers,
of whom he soon obtained the command: reducing
them to a regular discipline, and lived
among them as their captain.</p>

<p>In his present situation in the island of Pantalaria,
he and Dianora formed many plans for
their future life, and at length resolved on
going to Spain, and from thence to the Canary
Islands; there to live in peaceful tranquillity

<!-- page 193 -->

and concealment. Violanta determined
to accompany them.</p>

<p>They now began to prepare all things for
the execution of this plan, which occupied all
their thoughts and industry. But fate soon
frustrated their intentions.</p>

<p>One morning Rinaldo went as usual to the
sea-side, where he saw a fishing boat putting
out to sea. He watched its course, as it steered
for Sicily, reflecting on his acquaintances
there, and on his friend Serena. Lost amid
these ideas, he threw himself down beneath
a tree, where he soon perceived a noise behind
him. He turned round, and saw in the
dress of the country, the old man of Fronteja,
walking toward him. Rinaldo sprang up, and
would have fled, but the old man cried out,
"Stay! wherever you go, I will follow you:
Here we are alone."</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What would you with me? Why
do you thus pursue me every where, as a bad
conscience pursues a criminal, while I am still
ignorant who you are? Why do you thus disturb
me in my peaceful retreat, and poison with
your presence the tranquil joys of solitude?
If you are my evil genius, depart from me, for
I am no longer the man I was, and hold no
further communication with you.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Hey day! You are become a
very powerful lord, now you are in Pantalaria.
Do you imagine you are speaking to one of
your former banditti?</p>

<!-- page 194 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. By no means. But why should you
persecute me in this peaceful rural retreat, and
poison all the joys of my life?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You have not yet permitted me to
speak.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Speak.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You disappeared suddenly, and
none of your friends or acquaintance in Sicily
knew whither you were gone. I alone knew
it: and that I did know it, my presence here
is a proof. The black fraternity is, we hope,
sufficiently humbled; and your friends have revenged
you on your persecutors. Now all is
ready for our departure to Corsica, and every
one asks, where is our leader? where is the
brave Rinaldini, who promised to fight at our
head? Thus you were sought for every where,
but found nowhere. They became impatient,
called me to an account for your sudden disappearance;
and presumed to indulge in many
conjectures to my prejudice. I knew whither
you were gone: I knew what you had found
here, and the resolution you had formed. You
renounced the road of fame, and desired not
the laurels that flourish for you in Corsica.
You are indeed no longer the man you were;
that I know and see. Your achievements have
soon grow old; your fame will go to the grave
before you. You have chosen a road for yourself,
and disowned your friend. I upbraid you
not with what I have done for you from time to
time; nor with my having saved your life: for

<!-- page 195 -->

without my intervention, your body would long
ago have been suspended between heaven and
earth. I do not envy you your repose; and
am happy you enjoy it through me. If you
are at peace; if you are happy, I may still rely
on your silent gratitude. I desire not to receive
it openly; but you cannot wish me to lose
on your account.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Lose! and on my account! what
can you lose:&mdash;you, who have all?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. No, I have not all I wish: even
for your sake.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Your friends have thrown out a
dishonourable suspicion against me. Several
of them think you are no more. I would have
preserved silence, and suffered you to enjoy
your repose in Pantalaria; but a great part of
our body absolutely refuse to embark, till they
receive certain intelligence of your being alive.
You must save my honour, and show yourself to
these doubters.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How can you require it of me?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. My honour depends on it.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I cannot comply with your wish.
I will not depart from hence.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Must I once more remind you,
that you are indebted to me for your life?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You would rob me of it, if you tore
me from my peaceful abode. I will not go
from hence.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You will not?</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Well, then these doubters must
come to Pantalaria and see you themselves.
This is the only way that remains.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Reckon not upon it. I can go
elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Whither can you go, and I not
know it?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Oh heavens! Why should Providence
deliver me into such hands? Old man,
whatsoever you may be called, or whosoever
you may be, if the happiness and peace of any
man was ever held sacred by you, have pity on
me, and leave me in solitude and repose.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. That I will; but you must rescue
my honour from a false suspicion which covers
me with shame. Have I deserved this of you?
Shall I suffer an accusation of having murdered
you to remain unanswered? Shall our whole
enterprise fail on this account; and the noble
Corsicans in vain expect the promised aid? You
cannot desire it. Show yourself to your
friends, and then go wherever you please.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. If I did but know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Know what?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. That what you require of me
would procure me repose.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. If you really possess peace of
mind, you will take it with you wherever you
go; but what you have not, you cannot transplant
anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I was possessed of such peace till

<!-- page 197 -->

you came enviously to rob me of it. If you
really are a good man, and since you have once
generously and disinterestedly saved my life, I
cannot comprehend why you should again deprive
an unfortunate wretch of that peace
which Heaven has granted him, and which is
dearer to him than the miserable life you upbraid
him with having saved. I will follow
you however to Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. My gratitude shall prove what I
can do for you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I comply to save your honour, and
forward the expedition to Corsica. But not
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Take two days. At the expiration
of that time we will meet again here.</p>

<p>Rinaldo was about to reply, but the old man
suddenly went away, and Rinaldo soon lost
sight of him behind the hill, on the road toward
the city.</p>

<p>Rinaldo, after a long deliberation, resolved
to deceive the old man, and not accompany
him to Sicily. He explained the circumstances
to Dianora, and informed her of all his adventures,
on which the old man had possessed so
great an influence. This rendered Dianora
very anxious for Rinaldo's safety, and she supported
him in the resolution he had formed;
but their chief difficulty was the procuring a
vessel to convey them to the small island of
Limosa, or Lampidosa, or even to that of Malta

<!-- page 198 -->

in preference; and this difficulty appeared
very great.</p>

<p>They were conversing on this subject, when
a letter from the proprietor of the villa, in the
city, was delivered to Dianora, informing her
that a lady and her waiting woman would that
evening arrive at the villa, where they would
take up their abode in the adjoining building,
and recommending them to her friendship.</p>

<p>This intelligence made no alteration in the
plan resolved on. Rinaldo went out in search
of a vessel, but returned home without success.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the expected stranger
sent to inform Dianora of her arrival, and soon
after waited on her to make her acquaintance.
Rinaldo would have left the room, but they met,
and he perceived his old friend Signora Olympia.
Her waiting woman was Serena.</p>

<p>The presence of these persons in this peaceful
villa, embarrassed Rinaldo extremely. In
the presence of Dianora, however, Olympia
played the part of a stranger to him, nor was
he in the slightest degree compromised by her
conversation. But Serena was unpractised in
the arts of dissimulation, and no sooner perceived
Rinaldo in the anti-chamber, than her
countenance brightened up, and she overpowered
him with questions, mixing now and
then some slight reproaches with her inquiries,
and Rinaldo with difficulty avoided an
open explanation.</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>When Olympia had finished her visit, she
sought an opportunity of speaking with her
old acquaintance alone, and this she found in her
chamber.</p>

<p>Rinaldo sought for it too himself, and wished
by some preliminary explanations to give a fair
turn to their mutual conduct toward each other.
Thus by degrees the conversation became very
interesting.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. The old man gave me an assurance
that he alone of all my acquaintance knew I
was here.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That I believe. At least I knew not
a word of it. You may imagine my surprise at
finding you here. I have acted, however, in such
a manner, that I doubt not you have nothing to
reproach me with.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. And what brought you to Pantalaria?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Necessity and providence. Half my
friends and acquaintance are arrested.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Arrested!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. On the requisition of the French
ambassador at Naples. We are betrayed, and
our plans relative to Corsica discovered.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Guards are placed at the dwellings
of the old man at Fronteja, and his young men
are arrested. As yet he knows not of it. I
bring him the first intelligence of this treachery.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Could not so powerful a man avert
this blow from himself and his friends?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. That I know not.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Or perhaps he departed because he
knew what was going forward?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Of that I doubt.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Will he be able to save his friends,
or is the farce of his juggling tricks brought to a
close?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. I know not what he will do.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you think he, and you, and I,
are safe in this island?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Who can read in the book of time?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I thought the old man could.</p>

<p>Here the old man himself entered the room.
He seemed perfectly tranquil, and taking
Olympia's hand, welcomed her on her arrival.
Olympia beheld him with embarrassment and
concern.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Daughter, you are confused?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Oh, you know not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I now wherefore you are come.
I know what is transacting in Sicily.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. What do you know?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And can you be so tranquil?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I cannot help it.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. No?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And do you abandon the enterprise
in Corsica?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I am ready to go to Corsica.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Still?</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Why not? Will you accompany
me?</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. And your friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Will soon follow.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. All?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Most of them.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Will you be able to rescue your
friends who are in prison?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You will see what will happen.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. Are we safe here?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. No&mdash;And therefore I shall sail
from hence.</p>

<p><i>Olympia</i>. When?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. As soon as is requisite.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Could you not avert this misfortune
from your friends?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. What has happened is your fault.
Had you remained in Sicily, we had now been
in Corsica. 'Tis you that must bear the blame
of the misfortune that has befallen your friends.
Your disappearance brought them into embarrassments,
which rendered it necessary to
postpone our departure, while I came to Pantalaria
to find you, and thus our friends were
apprehended; the French faction triumphs, and
the black fraternity exult in our misfortunes.
Me they shall not have in their power unless I
choose, but you they will seek out: and find
you in the arms of love. Your career is run,
and your friends are no longer powerful enough
to protect you. You fall a sacrifice to your
own imprudence. But what I <i>can</i> do for you

<!-- page 202 -->

in the last moments of your life, that I <i>will</i> do
at the expense of my own safety. You shall
learn how greatly I have been your friend.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Do you consider me so irretrievably
lost?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. I cannot consider you otherwise.
You, Olympia, will know what prudence advises.</p>

<p>Thus saying, the old man left them both in
a state of embarrassment and alarm. Rinaldo
asked Olympia what she proposed to do? to
which she replied, "I will follow the old man."</p>

<p>Rinaldo left her and went to Dianora, to
whom he disclosed as much of the circumstances
that now disturbed his peace as he thought
proper, and persuaded her to leave the villa as
soon as possible. Meanwhile he returned to
his old hostess, and took possession of his former
quarters.</p>

<p>At day-break he went to the beach, and was
at length fortunate enough to find a fishing
boat, of which the captain promised to convey
him within three days to Limosa, as soon as the
boat should be ready.</p>

<p>Till that time he proposed to stay at the
farm of his hostess's brother, which lay about a
league from the villa. He wrote to Dianora
to leave the villa as privately as possible, and
to join him together with Violanta.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he reconnoitered the ground, and
provided a secret retreat for himself, consisting
of a cave in a rock, which he examined

<!-- page 203 -->

narrowly, and found perfectly convenient for
concealment. He also stored it with food and
ammunition.</p>

<p>He had left this spot and was returning home,
when he perceived gliding between the hills on
one side of him, a white female figure in a veil,
who by her dress could be no common peasant.</p>

<p>This circumstance struck him forcibly. He
pursued her steps, and at length came up with
her on a plain. She went toward a villa, from
which a man in a plain dress, but not that of the
country, came out to meet her, and taking her
hand led her into the house.

Rinaldo approached the villa, and found a
girl cutting grass. He asked her, "Do you
belong to this villa?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Are the lady and gentleman who have just
entered, your master and mistress?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is their name?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>"How is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I have told you I do not know."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Neither do I know that."</p>

<p>"Are you a native of this island?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and of this villa, of which my father is
gardener."</p>

<p>"And does the villa belong to your master
and mistress?"</p>

<p>"No; it belongs to Signor Mandrani in the

<!-- page 204 -->

city. He is a rich man, and has let the villa to
my present master and mistress."</p>

<p>"Have they been long here?"</p>

<p>"The orange trees have been twice in bloom
since they came."</p>

<p>"Are they foreigners?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you want any thing of either of
them that you are so particular in your inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Oh no."</p>

<p>Rinaldo gave the girl some money, and leaving
her, returned home, where his hostess
presented him a letter from Dianora. She
approved his prudence, but thought it better
that she should remain at the villa till the
departure of the boat was fixed and certain.</p>

<p>Martha was despatched with an answer to
Dianora; but she was scarcely gone before the
old man of Fronteja entered Rinaldo's apartment.
Rinaldo asked him with chagrin, what
brought him hither?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. My friendship for you.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Can I then nowhere be safe from
your importunities?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. No where as long as you live.
Never while I am more your friend than you
know how to value.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. How have you again discovered my
abode?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. That must be very unimportant
to you. 'Tis enough that I am here, and (if

<!-- page 205 -->

you will follow me and take my advice) am
here for your advantage.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Still you may be saved: I will still
bring you safe to Corsica.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. This haughty conduct cannot indispose
me to serve you, because I am your
friend, as you will perhaps discover when it is
too late in the last moment of your life. Now
I repeat it, you may still be saved: but not
after this day.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Indeed?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Most certainly. By the Almighty
that rules us, not after this day. Be not astonished.
I speak that which is certain.&mdash;Follow
the advice of your friend, Rinaldo.
Accompany me, save yourself, and spare me
those tears which I shall shed over your
grave.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To-morrow do you say my fate is
determined?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. To-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. To-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. To-morrow; and to-morrow for
ever. The morning that will smile on you after
this present night, will be the last of your life
if you remain here, and do not go with
me.</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Give me a proof of what you
say.</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p><i>Old Man</i>. How can I?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. I will believe you. But let me see
some miracle.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. How can I?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. Good night.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. You believe me not?</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. No. To-morrow will not be the
last of my days.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. It will. It will by the Almighty,
and by my immortal soul!</p>

<p><i>Rinaldo</i>. You wish to entice me to Corsica.
I will not go, I defy your prophecy. I will
stay here.</p>

<p><i>Old Man</i>. Now then if you will not seize
the hand I offer for your salvation, still shall my
friendship remain with you, and my tears shall
accompany you to the land from which you
can never return.</p>

<p>As he said this, his head sank, and he remained
a few moments in that posture, then went to
the door, which sprang open with a loud noise.
The light in the room grew dim, and a white
dazzling form glided in.</p>

<p>The old man exclaimed, "Great Heavens!
Rosalia!" and rushed out of the room.</p>

<p>"Thou juggler!" cried Rinaldo, then casting
his eyes upon the form, actually perceived the
face of Rosalia. He started back, she opened
her arms, seemed to press something against
his breast, beckoned him, and vanished.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rinaldo awoke ere the
first dawn of day, having slept but little.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"This is the day," exclaimed he, "which is to
put a period to my life. Who told the old
man with such certainty, that this day shall be
my last, and that only if I stay in this
island?"</p>

<p>He arose, wrote to Dianora, and having dispatched
the letter to her, set forward to his
cave, which he determined not to leave during
the whole day, in order to falsify the prophecy
of the old man.</p>

<p>He had already approached the rock, when
he perceived on the beach, at a distance near
the side of the cave, some Sicilian soldiers.
This struck him so forcibly, that he left the
path and took another leading to a wood.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached it, when he perceived
a strong party of soldiers in the valley
marching toward it. He therefore left the
wood, and went toward the villa, where he
had seen the unknown gentleman and lady the
day before.</p>

<p>He found the garden door open, and entered
it. The unknown gentleman immediately came
out of a pavilion to meet him, and they instantly
recognized each other. He was the prince
della Rocella.</p>

<p>"My prince!" exclaimed Rinaldo, with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate man," said the prince, "Are
you here?" And immediately returned into
the pavilion.</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>Rinaldo, however, ventured to follow him,
and threw himself upon his knees before him.
He heard a cry of terror, and perceived upon
a sofa the beautiful Aurelia. This sight overpowered
him, and he was unable to rise.</p>

<p>The prince gave him his hand, and raising
him. said, "If you remain in this island, this is
the last moment of our stay here."</p>

<p>"No," said Rinaldo, hesitating, "I will not
remain here. To-morrow at day-break I shall
leave the island, and you will see me no more.
Thank heaven I have again seen you alive.
This interview is one of the happiest moments
of my wretched life."</p>

<p>"Are you here also connected with your
men?" said the prince.</p>

<p>"No," replied Rinaldo; "I am no longer in
that horrible connexion. Those bands of
shame that once bound me are torn, and I am
now as it were another man."</p>

<p>Aurelia arose from the sofa, and was about
to leave the pavilion, when the gardener came
out of breath, saying, the villa was surrounded
by Sicilian soldiers.</p>

<p>"That is on my account," cried Rinaldo, in
broken accents.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate man!" cried Aurelia, and sank
again upon the sofa.</p>

<p>"Try to save yourself," said the prince.</p>

<p>"It is too late," said Rinaldo, sighing; "I
have despised the counsel and warning of a
friend. It is too late."</p>

<!-- page 209 -->

<p>A loud noise was now heard near the pavilion,
which was immediately surrounded by
soldiers, and an officer entered.</p>

<p>"Here he is," said a voice.</p>

<p>Rinaldo turned toward the voice, and his
mortal enemy, the black man, stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Have I deceived you?" said he to the officer;
and pointing to Rinaldo: "This," said he,
"is Rinaldini&mdash;seize him, hold him fast."</p>

<p>"Are you Rinaldini?" said the officer.</p>

<p>"I am," replied Rinaldo.</p>

<p>A confusion now arose about the pavilion, and
the old man of Fronteja rushed in.</p>

<p>"Rinaldo," said he, "I have promised you
my friendship even in death. I keep my word;
you cannot now be saved. Farewell."</p>

<p>As he said this, he drew a poniard and
stabbed him in the breast, before any one could
prevent him.</p>

<p>Rinaldo fell upon the sofa, near Aurelia,
who immediately swooned.</p>

<p>The old man turned toward the black man,
and said, "Now you are lost."</p>

<p>He then cast his eyes on Rinaldo, and said,
"Your friend Onorio could only close his unfortunate
tutorship by your death. You ought
to have been a hero, and became a robber.
You could not forsake the course you had
pursued, and your tutor could not behold you
upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>Then wiping the tears from his eyes, and

<!-- page 210 -->

turning to the officer, he said, "In the name
of the king, seize this black traitor, and as
for me, conduct me to Naples. I must be
tried by the laws of my sovereign. There I
shall know how to justify my conduct!"

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

</div>

<p>YEARS have passed away, and the scene
is now in another part of the world. The
British colonies in North America had thrown
off their allegiance to the Mother Country,
and since the glorious declaration of the 4th
of July, 1776, many a hard fought battle
had deluged the plains of the new world
with blood. For seven years the little armies
of Washington had indefatigably struggled
with hosts of British and mercenaries
poured upon the defenceless shores of America
by the tyrannical George the Third and
his servile ministers. At the very commencement
of the American struggle the
eyes of all continental Europe looked anxiously
on, with ardent hopes for the success
of the noble undertaking upon the part of
the <i>few</i> but <i>brave</i> spirits who had so manfully
asserted the self-evident truth that the
privileges of mankind are "life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness." Many kindred

<!-- page 211 -->

souls, fired with the brave example, left their
peaceful homes in Europe to partake of the
toils of the American struggle for independence.
The good, the gallant La Fayette
for one; Kosciusko for another; Baron De
Kalb too, and Count Pulaski. Among many
noble foreigners, like those mentioned, was
an elderly person, who was known in the
American army by the name of the CHEVALIER
DE BAYARD. He bore merely the rank
of a captain in the army of Washington,
and though promotion had been frequently
tendered to him by the commander-in-chief,
yet he had always declined to accept it.</p>

<p>Towards the last of August, 1781, the
French fleet under the command of the Count
de Grasse sailed up the Chesapeake and
blockaded the British in Yorktown. Washington
promptly repaired with his army to
the assistance of the French, and took up
his position before Yorktown.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening in the month of
September&mdash;the bright moon shed her beams
over river and land. The fleet lay calmly
upon "the bosom of the waters," and the
white tents of the Americans glistened over
the plain. The sentinels walked their lonely
rounds, and nothing disturbed the silence of

<!-- page 212 -->

the scene save at intervals the neigh of some
champing war-horse, or the distant bark of
a watchful house-dog. Two officers of the
American army had passed the sentinel at a
post near a romantic spot of greenwood, and,
partly shaded by the thick foliage of some
brushwood, were conversing in a low tone.
It was Washington and the Chevalier Bayard.</p>

<p><i>Washington</i>. Is it possible? You amaze me.</p>

<p><i>Bayard</i>. Yes, general, in the old man
now before you, you behold the former famous
<i>Rinaldo Rinaldini!</i></p>

<p><i>W</i>. You were stabbed you say by the old
man of Fronteja?</p>

<p><i>B</i>. Yes, and for a long time my life was
deemed precarious indeed, but my constitution
finally triumphed, and I was brought to
trial before the authorities of Sicily, together
with the old man. By the intervention of
powerful friends we were saved, and our
otherwise fatal punishment commuted to
banishment. We left Sicily together and
sailed for France, which we reached in safety,
and took up our abode in Paris, where I assumed
the name which I now bear.</p>

<p>At the siege of Yorktown, La Fayette and
the Chevalier de Bayard particularly distinguished
themselves. On one occasion the

<!-- page 213 -->

progress of the besiegers was considerably
retarded by the fire from two redoubts, advanced
about three hundred yards in front
of the British works. With a view to excite
emulation between the allied troops, the attack
of the one was committed to the French,
and of the other to the Americans. La Fayette
headed the American detachment, and
the Baron de Viomenil the other. Among
the American detachment was the company
of the Chevalier de Bayard. Just before
sunset, the two detachments, animated with
the emulous hope of doing honour to themselves
and their respective countries, marched
firmly to the assault. The American detachment
charged the redoubt without firing
a gun, and rushing over the abattis and palisades,
almost instantaneously carried the
works, with very inconsiderable loss.</p>

<p>On the 19th of October, 1781, Cornwallis
surrendered his sword to General Washington,
and the Independence of the North
American colonies was established. There
was rejoicing throughout the land. Congress
voted its thanks to many, among whom
was the Chevalier de Bayard. La Fayette
sailed upon his return to his native country
in December, 1781, and it was at first the

<!-- page 214 -->

intention of Bayard to accompany him, but
he eventually concluded to take up his residence
in the country whose battles he had
fought. He purchased a tract of land in the
state of New York, and immediately entered
into extensive improvements upon it; and it
was a source of no inconsiderable gratification
to him to watch from his retirement the
gradual success of a government which he
had himself so efficiently aided in establishing.
With General Washington he was a
constant correspondent, and we have his letters
to the general up to the date of 1793.
In the graveyard of the village church in the
small town of C******, may be seen a flat
tombstone bearing the following inscription:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">TO THE MEMORY<br/>

of the<br/>

CHEVALIER JULE ERNEST DE BAYARD,<br/>

an Officer<br/>

in the Armies of the American Revolution,<br/>

who departed this life August 16th, 1797, in the 81st year<br/>

of his age.<br/>

<i>Requiescat in pace</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>There, in that village church-yard, with the
green willow drooping over his tomb&mdash;after
passing the latter years of his existence in
the peaceful enjoyment of rural life&mdash;repose
the earthly remains of one who in another
career was known to us as the bandit
RINALDO RINALDINI.</p>
