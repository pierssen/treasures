<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THE favorable reception which the public gave to
the Widow Bedott Papers, by Mrs. F. M.
Whitcher, has induced the publication of another
volume of the works of the same author.</p>

<p>It is a natural desire that we wish to know something
of the personal history of those who have amused or interested
us, and the reader feels a claim upon a favorite
writer, kindred to the claims of friendship.</p>

<p>For this reason, we have deemed it not inappropriate to
accompany the present collection with a brief biographical
sketch of their author.</p>

<p>It might at first be supposed, that the life of one whose
writings prove her to have possessed such a remarkable variety
of talents, must furnish rich and abundant material for
an extended memoir. But it must be borne in mind, that
true "genius" is often allied to great delicacy and reserve
of character. And thus while it was apparent to all
who knew Mrs. Whitcher, that she was a person of superior
intellect, she was perhaps in every respect the opposite
of all that we learn from the term, "a strong-minded
woman." And so singularly modest and unobtrusive

<!-- page 12 -->

were her habits, that her life might safely yield in variety
of incident, to the humblest champion of woman's rights,
or the most obscure victim of woman's wrongs.</p>

<p>While her only claim to eminence is found in the remarkable
genius which her writings display; a respect
for that shrinking timidity with which she ever avoided
publicity, seems to forbid us to do more than to dwell
upon those features of her character which are in some
degree the property of her readers, and our sketch, therefore,
will necessarily be meagre; but we shall enrich
it with such extracts from her letters and her poems, as
will give to the appreciative reader a better idea of her
mental qualities than can be conveyed in any words of
our own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frances Miriam Whitcher, was the daughter of
Mr. Lewis Berry, and was born at Whitestown, Oneida
County, New York, on the first day of November, 1811.</p>

<p>This village shares with the township the name of its
earliest settlers, and is one of the oldest, as well as one of
the most beautiful villages in Central New York.</p>

<p>That fine scenery which every where marks the valley of
the Mohawk River, is spread out with particular magnificence
and beauty, in this immediate locality. The beautiful
hills, the broad, luxuriant valley, and the gently
flowing waters of the river, are among its natural attractions,
while the noble elms, which cast their grateful
shadows over its principal street, are a pleasant and perpetual
memorial of those who might be truly termed its
"first families."</p>

<p>In its earlier history, Whitestown was the shire town
of Oneida County, and the courts being held here, added
to its other attractions as a home for gentlemen of the

<!-- page 13 -->

legal profession. Many whose names have been high in
forensic distinction and brilliant upon the pages of history,
were then counted among its citizens, and gave to
the social circle of that time a character for liberal culture
and refined taste inferior to none in the State.</p>

<p>Thus, fortunately, her early associations were such as not
only furnished examples of superior mental excellence, but
were well calculated to develop those germs of latent
genius, the possession of which she showed even in childhood.</p>

<p>While yet only two years old, and ignorant of her alphabet,
she learned to recite long pieces of poetry, and
very early began making rhymes herself. The first of
these of which any record is preserved, is a parody on the
familiar verses entitled "My Mother," which were common
in the juvenile Readers of that time. The "Grandfather"
alluded to in the parody, was a member of her father's
family, with whom the child was far from being a favorite.
Her lines ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Who was it, when our friends were here,<br/>

And in the room I did appear,<br/>

Said, "This is Middy, she's our dear"?<br/>

My Grandfather.</p>

<p>Who was it, when I swept the floor,<br/>

Would make me sweep it o'er and o'er,<br/>

And say, "Come back and sweep it more"<br/>

My Grandfather.</p>

<p>And when I let the platter fall,<br/>

Who said, as loud as he could bawl,<br/>

"Now just come back and break them all"?<br/>

My Grandfather.</p>

</div>

<p>A short time previous to the composition of this parody,

<!-- page 14 -->

when five years old, she made "her first pictorial exploit,"
as she afterward termed it, by drawing the likeness
of an old gentleman, who, by familiar, but not intentionally
offensive joking, had incurred her displeasure.</p>

<p>The circumstance forms the subject of the first picture
in a series of humorous sketches, which were made years
afterward for a friend to whom she had promised an illustrated
volume of her life.</p>

<p>Her first teacher seems to have been an antiquated
maiden, who did not sufficiently gain her respect to escape
her ridicule; for we find her in the same series in many
sketches, where the position evidently was not chosen for
the benefit of the sitter.</p>

<p>From this juvenile institution she was promoted to the
primary department of the village academy, where her
mirth-loving propensities found a new and wider field for
exercise, which she did not fail to improve; for here nothing
capable of a ludicrous construction escaped her delicacy
to perceive, and ability to portray; and while this
"mischief" often brought her under discipline, her punishments
we find, in turn, made the subjects of her
sketches&mdash;so emphatically did her ruling passion "grow
by what it fed on."</p>

<p>A better account of this may be learned from her own
words, in a letter to Mrs. Alice B. Neal, a friend to whom
she was known only through the medium of the pen, and
the sympathy of kindred intellectual tastes.</p>

<p>"Your last kind letter was very gratifying. The acquisition
of a new friend is a source of great pleasure to
me; for I assure you that it has never been my lot to
have many friends. You possess the happy faculty of
drawing all hearts at once to you; but I, unfortunately,

<!-- page 15 -->

do not. And I will tell you what I believe to be the
secret of it: I received, at my birth, the undesirable gift
a remarkably strong sense of the ridiculous. I can
scarcely remember the time when the neighbors were not
afraid that I would 'make fun of them.' For indulging
in this propensity, I was scolded at home, and wept over
and prayed with, by certain well-meaning old maids in
the neighborhood; but all to no purpose. The only reward
of their labors was frequently their likenesses drawn
in charcoal and pinned to the corners of their shawls
with, perhaps, a descriptive verse below. Of course I had
not many friends, even among my own playmates. And
yet, at the bottom of all this deviltry, there was a warm,
affectionate heart&mdash;if any were really kind to me, how I
loved them!"</p>

<p>One little picture in the series alluded to from her
"ideal world," which has pleased us particularly, is entitled
"The Adventure." It is thus described by herself,
during a walk on the banks of the river about a mile from
her home,&mdash;she related to her companions thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once I was walking here, when I saw on that stump
of a tree a beautiful Bible all bound in gold lying open.
I started to get it, when a little angel with shining wings
came flying down towards it, and when I reached the
place the book was a heap of ashes, and the angel was
gone."</p>

<p>Her school education was completed in her native village,
with the exception of some lessons in French, from
a very superior teacher in the neighboring city of Utica,
where she acquired a high proficiency in that language,
but with an instinctive horror of affectation and display,
she always avoided, both in conversation and in writing,
the use of any foreign words or phrases.</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>In the art of drawing, in which she has left such abundant
proof of her taste and skill, her only instruction was
a few hints from a similarly gifted relative.</p>

<p>In epistolary correspondence she particularly excelled,
her pen gliding without an effort into rhyme, and making
the most trivial occurrences attractive by her happy power
of expression, as well as by the most life-like pen drawings,
with which her letters are embellished, and in which
she often introduced herself in some most ludicrous or
preposterous manner.</p>

<p>Nothing was allowed to escape her pencil or her pen,
and even the every-day occurrences in a quiet family furnished
material, which when embellished by her genius,
became amusing and interesting. The following mock serious
lines on the death of a pet crow, show her ability to
mingle the ridiculous with the sublime:&mdash;

<div class="small">

<p>No sigh was heard, no tear was shed,<br/>

And not a word was spoken,<br/>

But the pale cheek and drooping head<br/>

Told how their hearts were broken.</p>

<p>There was no outward sign of woe,<br/>

Though every hope had failed 'em,<br/>

A chance observer scarce would know<br/>

That aught uncommon ailed 'em!</p>

<p>Manhood and youth and age were there,<br/>

Touched with the same deep sorrow;<br/>

They thought of one whom they must bear<br/>

To his barn-yard grave, to-morrow.</p>

<p>There in an old tin pan he lay,<br/>

The once beloved and cherished;<br/>

Alas, how soon he passed away,<br/>

How cruelly he perished!</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>And one was there, once gay and spry,<br/>

'Twas one that did adore him;<br/>

A maniac glare was in her eye,<br/>

She silently bent o'er him.</p>

<p>She loved the dear departed crow<br/>

Like dearest friend, or brother,<br/>

And watched his infant graces grow,<br/>

Just like some tender mother.</p>

<p>Love, like some tender flower of earth,<br/>

Long in her heart had wasted;<br/>

Tom, like the sun, had called it forth,<br/>

And death, like winter, blasted.</p>

<p>Her grief was silent, dark, and deep,<br/>

For, oh, she loved him, dearly;<br/>

'Tis never those who loudest weep,<br/>

That sorrow most sincerely.</p>

<p>There is a grief that dwells within,&mdash;<br/>

A grief beyond my telling;<br/>

When all the outward man grows thin,<br/>

But oh, the heart keeps swelling.</p>

<p>They tied his feet with cotton yarn,<br/>

And to his grave they bore him;<br/>

They buried him low behind the barn,<br/>

And stuck two shingles o'er him.</p>

<p>Then burst the torrent of her grief,<br/>

That long had lain concealed;<br/>

Her inward woes found some relief,<br/>

In being thus revealed.</p>

<p>"Oh never more," she wildly cried,<br/>

"His cheerful voice shall greet me,<br/>

He'll never wander by my side,<br/>

He'll never fly to meet me.</p>

<p>"He used to get upon my chair<br/>

When I was busy sewing;<br/>

<!-- page 18 -->

And tangle up my braided hair,<br/>

Almost without my knowing.</p>

<p>"He used to steal my knitting sheath,<br/>

His legs were wondrous nimble,<br/>

And once I ducked him most to death<br/>

For carrying off my thimble.</p>

<p>"But let his faults forgotten be,<br/>

For he has gone forever;<br/>

His like again we ne'er shall see,<br/>

Oh, never! never!! never!!!"</p>

<p>Some words of comfort then I said,<br/>

In vain those words were spoken;<br/>

Despondingly she shook her head,&mdash;<br/>

I knew her heart was broken.</p>

</div>

<p>The views and opinions of John Calvin were believed
and taught more than any other system of religious
doctrine, in her native village at that time; and she was
baptized in infancy, early instructed in the shorter catechism,
and while yet in her teens, was, at the close of a
revival, received into membership with the Presbyterian
Church, a connection which was for many years retained.
Her religious feeling and attachments at this time are very
pleasantly recorded in her lines on the removal of the old
church.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>All silently the twilight falls,<br/>

This ancient temple round,<br/>

And mournfully within these walls<br/>

My echoing footsteps sound.</p>

<p>Well may this heart with sorrow swell,<br/>

These tears of sorrow flow,<br/>

I come to breathe a last farewell,<br/>

A last sad look bestow.</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>No more shall bands of brethren meet<br/>

Within this hallowed place,<br/>

To worship at a Saviour's feet,<br/>

And seek a Saviour's face.</p>

<p>No more the inquiring crowd shall press<br/>

To learn the road to heaven;<br/>

Nor here the bleeding heart find peace,<br/>

The mourner feel forgiven.</p>

<p>No more the word of life shall fall<br/>

From hearts with love that burn,<br/>

Nor truth invite, nor mercy call<br/>

The wanderer to return.</p>

<p>No longer here shall music roll<br/>

Its thrilling strains along,<br/>

Nor pure devotion lift the soul,<br/>

In union with the song.</p>

<p>Here often hath my God revealed<br/>

His goodness and His power; <br/>

But now, old Church, thy doom is sealed.<br/>

And thou must be no more.</p>

<p>I stand alone within these walls;<br/>

There is no being nigh<br/>

To check the bitter tear that falls,<br/>

Or chide the rising sigh.</p>

<p>I weep, dear consecrated spot,<br/>

That thou must cease to be,<br/>

And oft, full oft, when thou art not,<br/>

Shall memory turn to thee.</p>

<p>I love thy sacred aisles!&mdash;'twas here<br/>

Where first my footsteps trod,<br/>

And mother gave, with holy fear,<br/>

That little one to God.</p>

<p>And oh! 'twas here that awful vow,<br/>

To be the Lord's, was spoken!<br/>

<!-- page 20 -->

The painful thought comes o'er me now,<br/>

How oft that vow I've broken.</p>

<p>Alas! my soul, how oft thy wings,<br/>

E'en in the house of God,<br/>

Have sunk 'neath vain imaginings,<br/>

And kissed earth's fleeting clod.</p>

<p>I love this place! While musing here<br/>

On pleasures known no more,<br/>

Some pleasant thoughts of former years<br/>

Float my lone spirit o'er.</p>

<p>Here I was wont to sit with some<br/>

I loved in childhood's day;<br/>

Many are in the silent tomb,<br/>

And many far away.</p>

<p>Here have I gazed with tearful eye,<br/>

Upon the death-cold brow<br/>

Of some whose spirits dwell on high,<br/>

Whose forms are mould'ring low.</p>

<p>Perchance e'en now that sainted throng,<br/>

Those spirits of the dead,<br/>

May glide these ancient aisles among,<br/>

Where they were wont to tread.</p>

<p>Methinks they've left those realms of light<br/>

And glory, where they dwell,<br/>

And hover o'er this place to-night,<br/>

That once they loved so well.</p>

<p>And many forms remembered well,<br/>

And once most dear to me,<br/>

Who long have ceased on earth to dwell,<br/>

Among that band I see.</p>

<p>Methinks I see that blest one too,<br/>

So lovely and so dear;<br/>

Who, scarce one little month ago,<br/>

Was sweetly singing here,</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>Young Harriet, who with dying breath,<br/>

The Saviour's love confessed,<br/>

Exulting raised a song in death,<br/>

And, swan-like, sunk to rest.</p>

<p>Sweet spirit! lift that tuneful voice<br/>

As thou wert wont of yore,<br/>

Let these devoted walls rejoice<br/>

In thy sweet strains once more.</p>

<p>'Tis gone! The heav'nly train is flown!<br/>

The sweet illusion fades!<br/>

And I am musing here alone,<br/>

'Mid evening's gath'ring shades.</p>

<p>Farewell! doomed temple of the Lord<br/>

For thee my tears shall flow;<br/>

I grieve to speak the parting word;<br/>

With ling'ring steps I go.</p>

<p>What, though upon this sacred spot<br/>

A statelier pile I see;<br/>

Dear house of God, when thou art not,<br/>

Shall memory turn to thee.</p>

</div>

<p>Later in life she found in the doctrines and teachings of
the Protestant Episcopal Church, a system of religion
more congenial with her taste, and more in harmony with
her judgment.</p>

<p>In person Mrs. Whitcher was above the medium height,
erect in figure, stately in her walk, with an air of reserve
and dignity. Her large dark eyes were full of expression
and soft liquid light. Her hair of glossy black was always
kept in the most tasteful and careful manner, while
her dress showed scrupulous neatness, and was characterized
more by an absence of bad taste, than by any effort
at effect in its arrangement.</p>

<p>One who often met her has said in our hearing,

<!-- page 22 -->

"It seemed to me Mrs. Whitcher always wore the same
dress," a remark that shows that she appreciated that sensible
maxim, that "to be well dressed, a lady's attire
should be so arranged as never to excite a thought."</p>

<p>She possessed a high degree of conversational ability
in the circle of congenial friends; their presence seemed
to inspire her, and to develop many little graces and attractions
which the first critical glance frightened away, so
much that among strangers and ordinary acquaintances,
she became reserved and timid to a degree which was
often regarded as haughtiness and pride, or a sense of
conscious superiority. But amid the genial circle of familiar
friends, her eye brightened with intelligence, her
features glowed with enthusiasm, while the liquid and harmonious
flow of her words possessed almost the charming
power of music.</p>

<p>The story of the Widow Spriggins was among the earlier
productions of her pen, and was originally written for
"The M&aelig;onian Circle," a social and literary association,
sustained by persons of taste and ability. The literary
productions of the Circle were presented to its members
in the form of a paper, which was for some time
called "The Momus," a name which it fully merited.
Among the members of the Circle, however, there were
some who deemed the paper too much devoted to "the
harmless comedy of life," and it was accordingly changed
in name, and somewhat in character, to "The M&aelig;onian."
The circumstances form the subject of an article from the
"M&aelig;onian," which may be found in the present volume.</p>

<p>The Widow Spriggins' articles were afterward favorably,
though not very extensively, introduced to the public
by Mr. Calvert Comstock, late editor of the Albany

<!-- page 23 -->

Argus, who was at that time editing a weekly paper at
Rome, New York, and was a personal friend of their
author.</p>

<p>She received no pecuniary compensation for any of her
articles, until the summer of 1846, when she became a
regular contributor to "Neal's Saturday Gazette." Its
editor, who was a humorist of acknowledged ability,
highly appreciated the genius of his contributor. But
neither his enthusiastic praise, nor the flattering reception
with which her productions were received by its readers,
could overcome her habitual self-distrust and timidity. In
a letter accompanying one of the Bedotts, she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I fear criticism; I fear 'the world's dread laugh.' I
fear a repulse, a failure; there are a thousand things to
make me shrink from taking a step which may look like
courting publicity; and I assure you, nothing but the
hope of one day reaping some pecuniary benefit, induces
me to offer myself as a contributor to your paper."</p>

<p>On the sixth of January, 1847, she was married to the
Rev. B. W. Whitcher, and in the following spring removed
to Elmira, Chemung County, where Mr. Whitcher
assumed the pastoral care of St. Peter's church.</p>

<p>The following playful rhyming letter, written during
her husband's temporary absence from home, a few days
after their marriage, may not be inappropriate here.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>I will weave an idle rhyme, dear,<br/>

A simple rhyme for thee,<br/>

For it seems a weary time, dear,<br/>

Since yester morn to me.<br/>

It seems a long, long while, dear,<br/>

That I've been left alone;<br/>

And I miss thy cheerful smile, dear,<br/>

And I miss thy kindly tone.</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>Through the busy morning hours, dear,<br/>

I've missed thy cheering word;<br/>

While I watered all the flowers, dear,<br/>

And fed the little bird.<br/>

I've been busy in your study, dear,<br/>

And made it nice and neat,<br/>

But I found it rather muddy, dear,<br/>

(Why don't you clean your feet?)</p>

<p>Your books and papers all, dear,<br/>

I've arranged the nicest way;<br/>

Your bump of order's small, dear,<br/>

It grieves me quite to say.<br/>

Ere you've been here a day, dear,<br/>

'Twill look as bad as ever,<br/>

Don't say I'm <i>Caudling</i>, pray, dear,<br/>

For I never mean to&mdash;never.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure, dear,<br/>

To fix each tumbled shelf,<br/>

And each old dud a treasure, dear,<br/>

It looked so like yourself.<br/>

I've been talking with my mother, dear,<br/>

And with my father, too,<br/>

With my sisters and my brothers, dear,<br/>

And still the theme was you.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The weary day has flown, dear,<br/>

'Tis silent evening now,<br/>

And I am all alone, dear,<br/>

But, Willie, where art thou?<br/>

And how employed? not smoking, dear,<br/>

Good gracious! if you should,&mdash;<br/>

But surely you were joking, dear,<br/>

When you threatened that you would.</p>

<p>Good-night&mdash;good-night! God bless thee,<br/>

My dearest and my best;<br/>

May no dark dreams oppress thee,<br/>

But angels guard thy rest:<br/>

<!-- page 25 -->

From every pain and sorrow, dear,<br/>

To guard thy precious life,<br/>

And bring thee back to-morrow, dear,<br/>

To thy true and loving wife.</p>

</div>

<p>Her peculiar traits of character were not particularly
adapted to her new sphere of life; her retiring and reserved
disposition illy qualified her for a position which
makes so great demand upon the demonstrative sympathies,
as that of a clergyman's wife. And, although she
found in Elmira a few whose friendship and kindness were
ever held in grateful remembrance, the greater number
of her new acquaintances regarded her with distrust and
suspicion; and her greatest pleasure was found in her
domestic relations. As a wife, she was ever kind and
thoughtful, placing a high estimate upon her marriage
duties, requiring the most refined and exalted tenderness,
which it was her constant aim to inspire.</p>

<p>In Elmira the "Bedott Papers" were continued and
completed. The "Aunt Maguire Letters," published in
Godey's Lady's Book, were written here, and a series in a
different style under the name of "Letters from Timberville"
were begun, which her death left incomplete. A
few of the first chapters of the story of Mary Elmer were
also written at this place.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Whitcher's literary reputation will perhaps
most particularly be identified with her humorous works,
she has left in her little poems and sketches and in the
graver composition of Mary Elmer, abundant proof that
she was not confined, in the range of her genius, to any one
department of literature, but might have gained a brilliant
reputation in the various walks of authorship. Those who
have known her heretofore only as the author of mirth-provoking

<!-- page 26 -->

productions, will find with surprise the depth,
tenderness, and spiritual beauty which her more serious
writings reveal. Possessing at the same time an eye for the
ridiculous, a sense of the grotesque in combination, and
the quaint in character, with a genuine love of the beautiful,
and admiration of the grand, her productions had
power not only to please the fancy, but to satisfy the higher
wants of the mind. Even her humorous articles do not
stand upon their wit alone as their chief merit; true, they
make you laugh, and thus they answer the true test of their
excellence in this respect. And the Widow Bedott might
have graduated as the very worst speller in the "bad spelling"
school of literature so popular at the present day,
but her humor was always the vehicle of sense "to point a
moral or adorn a tale," and even when the widow discourses
"on punkins," she reads a wholesome homily to the
troublesome neighbor who "borroweth and repayeth not
again."</p>

<p>As an appreciative critic has said, "There is as clear
delineation of character in these writings as in the works
of Dickens or Thackeray. They are the cleverest, as well
as the most popular of any articles of the kind by an American
author. Those doomed perforce to immortality by
the hand now stilled forever, should be satisfied that they
have secured what so many have labored assiduously to
obtain."</p>

<p>Saxe finds "it is a very serious thing to be a funny
man," and Mrs. Whitcher found it "a very serious thing"
to be a funny woman. Few writers since the days of
Coleridge have been so much at the same time the subject
of panegyric by their friends and of censure from their
enemies; for while the reading public were convulsed with

<!-- page 27 -->

laughter over the inimitable drollery and cleverness of her
sketches, and editors were eagerly striving to secure the
popularity which her contributions commanded in whatever
publication they appeared, their author was being assailed
with the greatest vituperation and personal insult from
those who fancied they had unwittingly furnished models
for her sketches; and in one instance Mr. Whitcher was
threatened by a man with legal prosecution for damages,
which Mrs. Samson Savage had done to characteristics
which he fancied belonged exclusively to his wife, and
other less prominent characters were zealously searched out
and applied, as many an indignation meeting could witness.
"This means you," and "this means such a one," they
said, as each fitted the garment to a neighbor's back, while
all united in aiming resentment at the author with as much
anger as if she had labelled their parcels with their individual
names.</p>

<p>So high indeed ran the tide of angry feeling that it soon
became apparent that Mr. Whitcher's usefulness as a
clergyman would find fewer obstacles in some other parish.</p>

<p>Such a result was entirely unanticipated by Mrs.
Whitcher. Her characters were not designed simply to
represent individuals, but were types of different classes;
and however closely they may apply to particular persons,
it is illiberal to so universal a genius as hers as to attempt to
confine its application simply to one locality. But not in
Elmira alone were hunted up originals for her portraits.
A few weeks after the publication of the sewing society
articles, Mrs. Whitcher wrote thus to a friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is an amusing fact that several villages are contending
for the honor of being the birth-place of 'Mrs.
Samson Savage.' A man from a village in &mdash;&mdash; County

<!-- page 28 -->

came into one of the bookstores the other day to get some
'Lady's Books,' saying that they were all alive about it in
his place, because they had a 'Mrs. Samson Savage'
there. And we have heard from &mdash;&mdash;, a village twenty
miles distant, that they have fitted the coat to a woman
there."</p>

<p>And yet Mrs. Samson Savage and Mrs. J. Pixley
Smith are only representatives of that large class where
ignorance and vulgarity are only made more conspicuous
by wealth. Sam Ludlow is a character by far too common
in real life; an unruly son of a ruling deacon; while Permilla
Spriggins is but a pitiful illustration of the effect of
the continual reading of love stories on vain and weak-minded
girls. Almost any one can find "a Hugelina," a
would-be-literary character among their own acquaintances,
however limited the circle may be.</p>

<p>It is true Mrs. Whitcher has been charged with satirizing,
in some of her characters, things which should be
held sacred from ridicule. But whether Sam Ludlow
"gets religion" for the purpose of getting hold of the
"old man's" purse-strings, or the Widow Bedott resorts
to Elder Sniffles for religious instruction with <i>habeas corpus</i>
intentions in her mind; if we examine closely we find
that it is only where selfishness and hypocrisy steal the
cloak of piety, that they are held up and made at once
odious and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Few lives have perhaps furnished better examples of sincere
piety and devotion than hers. That rare humility of
which we have already spoken, was not only a part of the
ornament of "a meek and quiet spirit," but of one scrupulous
in the conscientious discharge of duty. She not only
loved the public services of the church, but was constant

<!-- page 29 -->

and faithful in those devotions which receive the promise
of "Him who seeth in secret."</p>

<p>The following lines written during a period of suffering,
show how well she had learned that hardest of all Christian
lessons, resignation to the solemn ascription, "Thy will
be done."</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Afflict me, Father; let thy heavy rod<br/>

Fall on my sinful head;<br/>

I would not shun the sufferings of my God,<br/>

Whose blood for me was shed.</p>

<p>Afflict me, Father; I will take the cross<br/>

Unmurmuringly and still,<br/>

By thy good help; and bear all earthly loss,<br/>

If I may do thy will.</p>

<p>Ay, slay me, Father, and I will not fear<br/>

The coming of Death's dart,<br/>

If I may see the Lord's kind angel near,<br/>

To strengthen my weak heart.</p>

</div>

<p>Not only in religious duties, but in the offices of friendship
was she eminently uniform and faithful, and a good
impression once made upon her feelings was enduring. In
illustration of this tenacity of feeling, we insert a letter
which was written not many years before her death, and
which refers to an affection, of which "Time but the impression
stronger made." This letter was addressed to the
same person as the one from which our former extract was
made.</p>

<p>"I was quite alone all last evening, and my mind wandered
to you. I cannot tell why it is, but your idea is
always associated in my imagination with a dear sister of
mine, who died at sixteen, when I was only five years old.

<!-- page 30 -->

I recollect her perfectly. They say she was a genius; and
I remember that she was beautiful and joyous, and always
good to me. I loved her better than any one else. She
used to put me every night in my little crib, and sit and
tell me stories till I went to sleep, and hear me say my
prayers and little hymns. She had a thousand winning
ways. There was one pretty mark of love that seems very
pleasant to me now as I look back to it. She used often to
reward me for being good, by putting some trifle under my
pillow after I was asleep, and it made me so happy to
wake in the morning and find it. How easy it is to please
a child!</p>

<p>"This sweet sister took more pains with me than anybody
else ever did. It was a great calamity that I lost
her. Yet I have always felt that there was still a bond
between us. When I was little, I used to dream of her
almost every night, and, as I grew older, I thought about
her a great deal. In my lonely rambles, I often fancied
that she called me; even now I sometimes think I can
hear her distinctly pronounce my name in the night. I
know not why it is so, but I fancy that you are like her.
I was thinking of it last evening as I sat alone, and I threw
aside my sewing and scratched down these simple verses to
you. View them, dear &mdash;&mdash;, not as poetry, but as a little
token of affection."</p>

<p>Of the "verses" here mentioned, we will select two, as
illustrative of her attachment to the memory of her sister,
and of her belief in the intimate union between departed
spirits and their friends on earth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>True, some will call it fancy's flight,<br/>

And say it ne'er can be,<br/>

That in the wakeful hours of night<br/>

An angel speaks to me.</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>"The wondrous and mysterious ties<br/>

Some hearts can never know,<br/>

That link the loved in paradise<br/>

With those they love below."</p>

</div>

<p>Another little poem addressed to the same sister ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MY SISTER.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Would I were sleeping on thy peaceful breast,<br/>

Friend of my infant years:<br/>

Thou who couldst lull my wayward heart to rest,<br/>

And soothe my childish fears.</p>

<p>Oh, 'tis a blessed thing like thee to die<br/>

Before the dark hours come!<br/>

Before the light reflected from on high<br/>

Is lost in earthly gloom.</p>

<p>Peace to thee, bud of paradise! expand<br/>

In the Lord's garden; there,<br/>

The flowers are nurtured by the Almighty hand<br/>

To bloom in heavenly air.</p>

<p>Look down on me, O sister! think of me,<br/>

By sin and suffering tost;<br/>

Lonely and sad my heart turns back to thee,<br/>

So loved! so early lost!</p>

</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1850, Mrs. Whitcher returned to
Whitestown. Her literary labors had been almost suspended
during the year just passed, as her time had been
occupied in the care of her infant daughter. Few women
have discharged with higher appreciation or greater love
their maternal duties, than was now shown in her devotion
to her child. Her health, which had for some time been
delicate, now began more perceptibly to fail, and the symptoms

<!-- page 32 -->

of the consumption, which for a longtime had hung
like a threatening shadow over her, now made their presence
more apparent. Still she declined to receive medical
aid, feeling reluctant to begin a contest where the struggle
promised to be long, and the result uncertain.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to those who loved her that it
was,</p>

<p class="small">"The little rift within the lute,<br/>

That by and by should make its music mute<br/>

And slowly widening, silence all the sound!"</p>

<p>Prompted by maternal affection, she applied herself to
making her child's wardrobe, and, as opportunity offered,
resumed her labor on the story of Mary Elmer.</p>

<p>It had long been her intention to write something in a
graver style than anything which she had hitherto offered
to the public. Much as she excelled in the comic vein, we
think it was not chosen to gratify her own taste or inclination,
for in one of her letters written from Elmira, she
says, "I am heartily sick of Bedotting and Maguiring,
and only wish I could be as well paid for more sensible
matter." She would no doubt have found more pleasure in
the exercise of a higher and purer taste, but her inclination
was overruled by circumstances. The intense pathos
of Mary Elmer may have been heightened by the fact that
it was written during a period of physical suffering, but it
proves that its author possessed as great power over the
pathetic as the risible emotions of the reader, and like the
"immortal bard" when she chose to "come no more to
make you laugh," possessed equal ability to present "such
solemn scenes as cause the eye to flow."</p>

<p>Like many other humorists, her natural tendency was
more to melancholy than to mirth, and we learn from one

<!-- page 33 -->

who loved her, that her pen which was employed so successfully
for the amusement of others, was often guided
by an eye dim with unshed tears.</p>

<p>Although, like Hood, she had found the public ear
more open to melodies than to maladies, with him she felt
that "a life of mere laughter is like music without its
bass, or a picture of vague unmitigated light, while an
occasional melancholy is like those rich old glooms of
Rembrandt."</p>

<p>The pathos of Mary Elmer was as easy to her pen as
the humor of Spriggins or Bedott; for her gifts were like
song to the bird, or perfume to the flower; and thus the
success of her writings does not depend upon her energy,
for she was easily discouraged, and always self-distrusting,
while her humility kept her always from self-assertion,
and often from effort. Thus her life became one of observation,
rather than of action; and to the last her literary
productions were cast doubtingly upon the uncertain
stream of public favor.</p>

<p>She never showed any undue devotion to the material
and practical, and seemed strangely unconscious of the
possession of those talents, which, if united with greater
worldly wisdom, might earlier have brought her the
grateful reward of fame, as well as those more tangible
returns which the world counts as the criterion of
success.</p>

<p>That remarkable sagacity with which she appreciated
the springs of human passion, and which with such rare
perspicuity her writings display, she seldom brought into
working use, for she was credulous and unsuspecting in a
marked degree.</p>

<p>The story of Mary Elmer, on which she bestowed her

<!-- page 34 -->

last literary labor, was left unfinished. The last letter she
ever penned was one which accompanied some chapters
of her manuscript to her publisher, and was written only
three weeks before her death. From it we make an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never sent off a manuscript so unsightly as this.
But I can do no better. You will see that it bears evidence
to the trembling hand and miserable body sustained
by opiates. Oh, the horrid stuff! There would never be
any danger of my becoming an opium-eater from choice.
I hope the compositor will not be utterly confounded. I
send three chapters, and the rest will be forthcoming as
soon as circumstances will permit. I have been very desirous
to finish this story, probably the last I shall write.
And I trust there will be nothing in it 'which, dying, I
should wish to blot.' Perhaps Mr. &mdash;&mdash; may think the
style too plain and homely. I have been so anxious to
avoid the grandiloquent style of many of our female story
writers, that I may have gone too far the other way. I
have become so entirely disgusted with that sort of composition
applied to the commonest and most trifling subjects,
as well as to those more important, that I never
have patience to get through an article of that description."</p>

<p>Her manuscript has been carefully preserved by Mr.
Whitcher, and it was not until after repeated efforts to get
it completed by others had failed, that the present writer
attempted the task of "ending," not to say "finishing"
it, not unconscious of the presumption with which the act
might be regarded by many, for one without literary experience,
or even literary ambition, to attempt to add to
anything a genius like hers had left incomplete, yet anxious

<!-- page 35 -->

to give to usefulness a little tale which seemed quite
too good to be lost.</p>

<p>After sending away her last letter, her health began to
fail more rapidly, and her time was devoted to more immediate
preparation for death.</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living and Dying was now her
constant companion, as it had been a solace and comfort
in hours of health.</p>

<p>She received with humility the holy communion, and all
the consolations which the Church of England has in store
for her departing children.</p>

<p>The sun which rose on the fifth anniversary of her
bridal day, shed its last rays into the room where she lay
clothed in the bridal robes of death. With the solemn service
of the Church she had so much loved, they committed
her body to the dust.</p>

<p>In the rural grave-yard of her native village, in the
little enclosure where lie those to whom she was connected
by family ties, and beside the sister for whose companionship
she had so long and fondly yearned, she rests. And
who can say but in "those heavenly habitations where
the souls of them that sleep in the Lord Jesus enjoy perpetual
felicity," their spirits are united in nearer and purer
ties, as in communion with the saints beneath the altar,
they join in the solemn anthem, "How long, O Lord," as
in earnest hope they wait the final benediction.</p>

<p>In accordance with her own humble wishes, her name
and age on a little tablet is all that marks her resting-place.
But in the hearts of those who loved her as a
friend, and admired her as an author, is written a brighter
and more enduring word of her virtues than can be traced
by the pen of the biographer, or graven in the eloquence
of sculptured marble.</p>

<p>OLD SONG.</p>

</div>

<p>I WAS born in Podunk, a charmin' and sequesterated
villidge on the banks of the morantic and meanderin'
Mohawk. My father's name was Nathan Ruggles;
he was an emigranter from Vermount, and
he married a Dutch young woman by the name of Vine
Hogobome, a natyve of Podunk. I was the oldest of ten
childern, five boys and five gearls. The boys was Nadab
and Abihu, (twins,) Cornelus, Bemas, and Gad. The
gearls was Permilly, (that's me,) Mirtilly, Ketury, (that's
a Dutch name,) Axy, and Vine. But I was the flower of
the family. I've heern my mother tell that I was a wonderful
cretur from the time I was knee high to a hop-toad.
Afore I was 10 year old I knowd eny most all the primmer,
and I could say them are vasses in't clean from "In
Adam's fall," to "Zaccheus he did climb the tree," without
missin' a word. And when I want but fourteen I knowd
by heart, all that are gret long piece of poitry that John
Rogers writ jest afore he was burnt to a stake.

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>When I was about sixteen our folks sent me to Miss
Van Dusen's boarding-school to Scaticoke. She was a
cousin of my mother, and whilst I was there besides lairnin'
all monner of 'complishments I took a mazin' notion to
readin' and red Rosabelly, and Alviry, and the Childern of
the Abby all through. Well, arter stayin' there three
months I went hum, and at my departer Miss Van Dusen
give me the Childern of the Abby, 'cause 'twas my favoryte
book and I was her favoryte puppil,&mdash;tellin' on me to
read it cerfully and 'twould improve my taste and understandin'
amazin'ly.</p>

<p>Well, I returned to the poternal ruff, and I tell ye I was
a touch above the vulgar, but I'd or'to tell ye how I
looked. My hair was of that lovely hue that folks calls red
and novils calls auburn. Sometimes I suffered it to flow
cerlessly over my alagaster sholders, and sometimes I confined
it on the tip top of my head with a quill. My face
was considerated imminently honsome. My figger was oncommon
greaceful, and I had a gret deal of dignitude.
But more 'n all that, I writ poitry of the first order, and
was called the biggest genyus in Podunk. I knowd I was
a touch above the vulgar, as I said afore, and so I kept
myself putty scerce. I didn't let nun of the fellers come
within gunshot of me tho' there want one there but what
would a jumped sky high to git me, but I didn't incurridge
'em, for I was detairmined I wouldn't give my affections to
nobody that didn't look like Lord Mortimer, him that the
Childern of the Abby tells about, and nun of the young
men in Podunk want no touch to him, for the biggest part
on em was amazin' fleshy and he want. Well, a number
on 'em arter a spell plukt up curridge to make up to me.
There was Bonypart Buggins, a visin' farmer, he took arter

<!-- page 41 -->

me consairnedly. One arternoon I was a sittin' under a
tree in the orchard readin' in the Childern of the Abby,
and I tho't I heern a noise, so I lookt up, and lo and behold
'twas Bonypart leanin' agin a stump.</p>

<p>"Your sarvent," says he. I gin him an all-to-pieces
stiff bow, and went on continuyin' reading&mdash;at last says
he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Ruggles."</p>

<p>"Hold yer tongue," says I.</p>

<p>"Ye needn't be so ferce," says he.</p>

<p>Then I riz right up and says I, "What do ye mean by
contrudin' yer pesky presence on my solitary medifications,
hay? If 'twant for disgracin' this ere book I'd heave it at
yer head." So he cleared out considerble skeart and never
bothered me no more.</p>

<p>And there was another young man in our town by the
name of Yokop Van Snorter, a marchant, that lived nigh
by, makin' money and doin' well. There want a gearl in
Podunk but what would a had him ony me, and I was the
ony one he took a notion tew. But he was as fat as a
hoss, and more 'n all that he had such a name 'twas enuf
to dizgust me. Well, he was kinder timersome and
darsent speak to me, so he writ me a "billydux," (that
are's the French for loveletter,) I can't remember edjackly
how 'twas supprest, ony I know he writ how't he loved me
better'n sour crout or flitters, or anything on airth, and
wanted me to marry him right off. Now in all the novils
I'd read, nun of the young men didn't make a supposition
in sich a stile, so I jist took it and writ on t'other side
o'nt,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You gret unheerd of Dutch lubber; ye don't know how
to tell a young woman the state of yer feelins, and if ye did

<!-- page 42 -->

I wouldn't have ye nor touch to, so ye may giv up yer endevers."
I sent the letter over by my little brother Gad,
and that evenin' we were all a sittin' round the kitchin fire,
mother a dippin' candles, Nadab and Abihu twistin' nutcakes,
and Mirtilly a fryin' on 'em, Bemas and Ketury knittin',
(my mother eddicated all her childern jest alike. She
didn't aprove of havin' the boys do all the out-door work
and the gearls all the housork, so in the arternoon the
gearls went out and helpt the boys chop wood and hoe
taturs, &amp;c., and in the evenin' the boys cum in and helpt
the gearls do up the chores,) but I was a readin, I never
had nothin' to do with kitchinary consairns, for I reckoned
and mother reckoned tew, that a young woman that had
been to boardin'-school and lairnt phizziology, and triggeology,
and astreology, besides paintin' and monners,
shouldn't or'to do no housork, and I never read in no novil
of a herowine that washed dishes and fried nut cakes, and
so forth. Amandy Malviny Fitzalen didn't do't, and I
was detairmined I wouldn't do't, tho' father used to jaw me
about it, for he never had no sense of properiety. But I
didn't think 'twas any disparagation to resist mother in supperintendin'
the childern, for I reckoned 'twas quite interestin'
to teach their young ideas how to fire, as Poke says,
and the evenin' I speak on I'd jest ben puttin' Cornelus and
Gad, and Axy and Vine, to bed in the trundle-bed, and
was beseated readin' in Cecely, (a novil belongin' to a naber
of ourn,) when father came in and says he to me, says
he, "Milly,"&mdash;says I, "Sir!" "Come up chomber,"
says he, "I want to see ye a minnit." So I shot up my
interestin novil with a sythe and fullered my ferce and
grumpy lookin' payrent. When we got up chomber he
shot the door and says he, "Milly,"&mdash;says I, "Sir,"

<!-- page 43 -->

says he, "Yer a darn fool." "Be, hay," says I, "what
for?" "Why," says he, "I've been over to Van
Snorter's store, and he told me all about that are mean
dirty trick you've ben a sarvin' him, with tears in his eyes.
If you'd a writ him a decent letter tellin' on him you
wouldn't marry him, it wouldn't a ben so bad; but even
then you'd a ben a fool, for you'll never git sich another
chance,&mdash;but to send him sich a sassy, crusty mess of
stuff; why you'd or'to be flogged for't. I tell'd him if I
was him I never'd speak to ye agin,&mdash;but he says he
takes arter ye yit, and wants me to perswade ye to have
him, and I tell ye ye'd better do't."</p>

<p>"What!" exclamigated I, "me have York Van
Snorter? why, he don't look no more like Lord Mortimer
than a back-log does! You may manure me in the most
gloomiest dunjin in Podunk,&mdash;you may deny me the enfuence
of the survivin' atmosphere,&mdash;you may deprive me
of every gratication in life, but you will never conduce me
to giv my willin' consent except agin my inclination, to be
led to the Hymonian alter by a bein' I can't bestow my
hull affections on, so I boseech on ye not to speak of him
agin."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know now," says father says he,
"whether ye mean ye'll have him or not."</p>

<p>"No, never!" exclamigated I, "I never can be
hissen!"</p>

<p>"You aint half-witted," says he, "them are plaguy
novils you've been a diggin' at's used up what little sense
ye had afore,&mdash;yer a standin' in yer own light, and I'll
let ye know I aint a guayne to have ye cut up any more of
yer capers."</p>

<p>So sayin' he went off and I begun tearin' my hair and lamentin'

<!-- page 44 -->

my sorrers the wost way. Putty soon Mirtilly and
Ketury heern me, and they come up.</p>

<p>"Massy sakes!" says Mirtilly, "what's to pay?"</p>

<p>"Gracious!" says Ketury, "what under the sun ails
ye?"</p>

<p>"What ails me?" says I. "Ax the ragin' oshun when
its flambergasted billers rolls high what ails it? Ax the
stormy sky when kivered with thunderin' clouds what ails
it? but ax not me what ails me,&mdash;my woes is incomprehensible
and uncombounded. I am surrounded on all sides
with miseries, and attackted on every hand by distractions.
A cruel and torranical father thretens me with his everlastin'
vengence if I don't marry an unadmyrable Dutch
josey! Oh happy Mirtilly! Oh unsofisticated Ketury!
ye hant no notion of the sorrers of the most onfortinate of
creturs!"</p>

<p>"How much she talks like a book," says Ketury.</p>

<p>"How much she talks like a fool," says Mirtilly, and
off she went to bed. But Ketury was more feelin', and
she staid a spell and tried to comfort me.</p>

<p>"But," says I, "leave me, Oh leave me alone in my
desperation, and go and seek 'tired natur's sweet restorer.' "
So Ketury went out and putty soon she cum back and
brung a gret hunk of candy to me.</p>

<p>"Offer me no candy," jackleated I.</p>

<p>Says she, "Why you tell'd me to git ye something sweet
to the store, and when I tell'd Van Snorter how't it was
for you he wouldn't take no pay."</p>

<p>"Go back," says I, "misunderstandin' child, and throw
it at his head." So she went, and when she cum into the
store she huv it as hard as ever she could right into Yan
Snorter's face, and made his nose bleed. Onfortinately,

<!-- page 45 -->

father he was in there, tho' she didn't see him, and when
she huv the candy he jumped up and grabbed her afore she
had time to get away, cryin' out "What do ye mean, ye
little wretch?" Says she, "Permilly tell'd me to do it."
So father he cum right strait home and into the chomber
with a cowhide in his fist, and says he, "You'll sup sorrer,
I tell ye, for that are caper of yourn." So sayin' he cum
at me, but I jumped over the bed, and afore he could hit
me, I got outside the door, and strapt it so's he couldn't
git ort,&mdash;then I ketcht my bunnit and shawl, stuffed the
Childern of the Abby in my pocket, went to father's chist
and hookt his leather money puss, and was out of the house
in a minnit. I see Ketury a cryin' by the gate, and says
I, "Go in and tell mother that I've absquandered to the
world's eend, and tell her not to have father let out in 3
hours, if she vallys my everlastin' peace of mind." So sayin'
I huv my arms round Ketury and giv a partin' kiss and
then "like a fair lily surcharged with tears,"* I run
acrost the meadys and fields till I cum to a tavern about
five miles from Podunk. I axed 'em if I mut lodge there,
and they said I mought, and says I to the lonlady, "Good
dame, give me a department alone by myself, for I desire
to ponderate, unseen by vulger eyes, on the heft of misfortins
that oppresses me."</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby.]</p>

<p>"What is't ye want?" says the ignorant cretur.</p>

<p>Says I, "Giv me a room alone, and fetch me a candle,
and sum ink, and sum paper, and a pen.</p>

<p>So she did, and I couldn't but admire to think how much
my sittyation was like Amandy's when she was so druv,
and arter collectin' my ideas, I writ the follerin vasses. I
reckon their considerble touchin'.</p>

<p>Arter I'd writ this poim, thinks me,&mdash;well, what's to be
did now? Arter considerin' a spell, I concludid to take
the stage in the mornin' and perceed to the town of Higgins
Patent, where my father had a sister livin', married
to a Mr. Jorrocks, a forehanded farmer. He was dretful
poor when he fust took arter aunt Huldy, and her payrents
wouldn't consent to her havin' on him, so they got married
unbeknown to nobody but the justice and sot right off for
Higgins Patent. For a spell grandfer Ruggles wouldn't
speak to her, but when uncle Jonah begun to be well to do
they made all up, and went a visitin' to see each other.
So in the mornin' I paid the damage, got into the stage
and travilled tew days and tew nights till I arrove to Higgins
Patent. When we drove up to aunt Jorrocks's door,
the driver he hulloed and out run uncle Jonah rubbin' his
eyes, for 'twant but 4 o'clock in the mornin'. Aunt she
stuck her head out of the winder to see who'd come, and
when she recognated me she was 'mazin' glad, for I never'd
ben there afore, and I was a gret favoryte of hern. But
they was dretful astoundered when they see I hadn't no
baggidge, and when we went in the house I tell'd 'em the
hull description of my leavin' hum from beginnin' to eend.

<!-- page 47 -->

Aunt Huldy said I'd did right, and uncle Jonah said he
hoped 'twas all for the best. "And now, my dear relatyves,"
says I, "I want to keep in a retired state of condition,
and don't want no livin' cretur but you tew to
know I'm here till I can send hum and git my clus," (for
I hadn't nothin' but the gownd I had on with me, and that
was a yeller calicer every day one.)</p>

PERMILLY."</p>

<p>About a week arter this, (I hadn't got no letter from
hum yit, mind ye) I was a settin' in my room where nobody
couldent see me, and nobody only uncle and aunt
didn't know I was there. Well, I was a settin' by the
winder readin' in "Thaddeus of Warsaw," quite an interestin'
novil of Aunt Huldy's, when I heern a knock to the
front door, so I run into the square room and peeked thro'
the curtin to see who 'twas, (for uncle and aunt had rid
over to the town of Utica to sell butter and eggs and git
sum things), so I peeked thro' the curtin and who sho'd I
see standin' there but the ginteelest, tallest, elegantest
young man ever I see. So I cut into my compartment and
stuck my head all full of mornin' glories that growed by
my winder, and then huv my white leno vail kerlessly over
my shoulders, and you never see an interestiner looking
beein than I was that minnit; then I went and opened the
door. The minnit the young man see me he throwd up

<!-- page 49 -->

his arms with admiration, and says he, "Ondoubtedly the
inchantin' cretur I see is Miss Permilly Ruggles." "Jest
so, that's my name," reiterated I. "Won't ye come in?"
So in he walked, and I sot a cheer for him and he telld me
that he'd ben a travellin' for his helth and stopt a spell in
Podunk, and bein acquainted with the postmaster there,
(Mr. Smith) he'd heern the hull of my history from him,
and he said that the account Mr. Smith had giv him of my
character and appearance, misfortins and pairsecutions, had
made him very much consairned and interested about me.
This surprised me amazinly, for I knowd Mr. Smith want
no frind of mine when I was in Podunk&mdash;use to laff about
me, and once I heerd he said I was a born fool. Well,
the young man went on to say how't bein' in the post-office
the day he left Podunk, my father cum in with a
letter he was a guayne to put in the mail to me, and so he
telld father how't he was a guayne right thro' Higgins
Patent to git hum, and he'd carry the letter free-gratis.
"So," says the young man, "I took the letter and here
it is, and I don't know whether to bless or curse the minnit
I agreed to be the bearer on't, as it has introduced me into
the presence of an angelic cretur that mabby'll disdain me,
and so be my ruination." I blushed "celestrial rosy red,"
and took the letter. "Oh," continuyed the charmin'
stranger, layin' his hand on his heart, "perhaps you'll be
surprised when I tell you that the fust sight of you has entranced
and enraptured my sperit. You will be amazed to
hear me confess that I, who, an hour ago, had never beheld
you, am now your devoted admirer and humble
suitor." So sayin', he fell down on his knees before me
and grabbed hold of my hand.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken, young man," says I, "in thinkin'

<!-- page 50 -->

I'd be astonished to see ye so besmitten at fust sight. I've
read of sich things time and agin, but as you're a stranger
to me it would be onprudent in me to purmit ye to pay
your devours to me. Howsomever, I won't disencourage
ye entirely, for your mouner of declarin' the state of yer
feelin's has possessed me considerable in yer favor, and I'm
purty sartin from your appearance you ain't no country
bushwhacker; so I beseech on ye to rise."</p>

<p>"Fairest of created creturs," says he, "I cannot rise
till you promise to reserve a leetle corner in your heart for
the despairin' Philander."</p>

<p>Thinks me, what a beautiful name he's got. "Git up,
Philander," exclamigated I, "the promise is yourn." So
he riz, and then says he, "Seraphic gearl! grant me one
of the flowers that decorate your head, to gaze on when
alone." So I gin him a mornin' glory, and arter kissin'
my lilly hand he went away syin'. As he was steppin'
out, says I, "Philander, be you sure your affection won't
never prove unconstant?"</p>

<p>Says he, "jest as sure as the vast furmament of sun,
moon, and stars moves round this terrestrious globe I
never will be false." So I shot the door and went up
chomber to look out of the winder at him as long as I
could see him, and when he got over the hill t'other side
of the house he hov away the posy I giv him and he begun
to laff as if he'd go off. At fust I was surprised to see
him laffin' so consairnedly when he seemed to feel so bad
at leavin' on me. So I watched him till he got out of
sight, and he kept a laffin', and every little while he'd kick
up his foot as if he was tickled, and finally I concluded he'd
got a highsteric fit brung on by his overpowerin' feelins.
Arter he'd made his disappearance I sot down to read

<!-- page 51 -->

father's letter. I've got the letter yet, and this ere's the
copy on't.</p>

<p>"GOOD FOR NOTHIN' DORTER MILLY:&mdash;You're mistaken
if you think I'll giv myself any oneasiness about ye. I'm
darn glad you've cleared out. To be sure I'd a ben willin'
to keep ye to hum and sho'd a did well by ye if ye'd a had
common sense, and acted as ye'd or' to; but you know
you've giv me more trouble for the last seven year than
you're woth&mdash;you haint airnt the salt to your porridge&mdash;and
more'n all that you'd begun to spile Ketury, and put
yer silly notions into her head. I tell ye agin, I'm glad to
be rid on ye, and hope ye'll stay to Higgins Patent till ye
can make up yer mind to act decent. Neighbor Cogsdill's
Obadiah's guayne west next week, and he'll carry ye yer
chist of duds. I'll send ye a leetle money, though you
don't desarve a cent seein' ye hookt my puss, and it'll be
the last ye'll git from me, for I'm peskily druv, and I've got
children enuff to hum to support, without takin' care of
them that runs away. Nor I aint a guayne to let ye be a
burden on yer uncle nyther&mdash;ye've got to get yer own
livin', and if I hear of yer idlin' away yer time I'll go and
fetch ye hum and put ye in the factry to work. Yer
mammy's sick&mdash;your goin' off has brung her clean down,
for ugly as ye be ye'r her darlin, but sen she heerd yer to
Higgins Patent she feels better&mdash;she telld me to tell sister
Jorrocks to take good care on ye, and I hope she will take
care on ye and train ye up and make ye stand round.<br>

Yer daddy,<br/>

NADAB RUGGLES."</p>

<p>As soon as Ide red this onfeelin' communication I begun
bemoanin' my sorrers consairnedly. "O! wretched me!"
jackleated I, "reduced to the horrid alternatyve of workin'
for a livin' here or guayne into a factry to Podunk! I'm

<!-- page 52 -->

pairsecuted and miserable, and nothin' pervents my spirits
from sinkin' into intire dispair in this tryin' hour except the
cheerin' idee of my greaceful Philander." I must a looked
very interestin' settin' there leanin' on my elbow, syin' and
groanin', my eyes swimmin' in tears, and father's cruil
pistle lyin' afore me. So I took the Childern of the Abby
to comfert myself by readin' a spell, and turned to the 5th
chapter cause there's a discription in't of Lord Mortimer
that's eny most ezackly like Philander, I remember it now
word for word, and though my Amandy Malviny Spriggins
has got the book now there aint no need of my lookin' in't,
for to describe Lord Mortimer, it says,</p>

<p>"He was now in the glowin' prime of life&mdash;his person
was strikinly eloquant, and his mouners insinniatinly
pleasin'&mdash;seducin' sweetness dwelt in his smile, and his
expressyve eyes could sparkle with contelligence, or beam
with sensibility, and the harmony of his voice giv a charm
to the elquation of his language which seldom or never
failed of bein' unresistible."</p>

<p>Now that's jest the way Philander lookt. He was very
tall, and the slimmest creetur I ever did see; his eyes was
as black as two coals, and good grievous! how expressyve;
his hair was black tew&mdash;black and shiny as a crow's tail;
and he had gret-big whiskers; on the hull he was the facsinatinest
beein I ever beheld. Be sure I'd a ben gladder
if he'd a happened to seen me and fell in love with me
without knowin' who I was; 'twould a ben more morantic.
Ye know Lord Mortimer couldn't find out for ever
so long who Amandy was, and he was eny most puzzled
to pieces. But then if he did know all about me I didn't
know nothin about him, who he was, nor where he cum
from: so I had jest as much unsairtinty and disquietude

<!-- page 53 -->

consairnin him as Lord Mortimer had consairnin' Amandy,
and I tell ye 'twas quite interestin' to be so sittyated.</p>

<p>Jest then Aunt Huldy and Uncle Jonah cum hum, and
I run down stairs and showd 'em father's letter. Arter
they'd red it, says aunt says she,</p>

<p>"The consairned old hog! he's mistaken if he thinks
I'm a guayne to let ye work for a livin'&mdash;so he may just
hang up his fiddle&mdash;and ye needn't be nun consairned
about it; ye shan't work nor touch tew."</p>

<p>"Oh my darlin' relatyve," says I, flingin' my arms
round her and kissin' on her, "yer extrornary kindness in
this gret and sad emairgency will never be blotterated from
my rememberation.* But I shan't be unindustrious, for
the idee of bein' manured in a factry as father thretens, is
shockin' to me, so I'll retire to my compartment and
ponderate for a spell, and then cum and tell ye the result
of my circumflexions."</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby.]</p>

<p>So I went into my chomber and was a wonderin' what
Amandy would a did in sich a dilamby&mdash;when all of a
sudding I happened to think how't when she had so much
trouble with Lord Mortimer's father she went off to Scotland
and kept school, and thinks me, I'll keep school tew.
So I went into the kitching and sot down betooxt uncle
and aunt, and I says to 'em, says I, "Dear frinds&mdash;reduced
as I be to the dretful alternatyve of doing suthing
for a livin' or beein' shot up in a horrid dunjin, I've concluded
what occerpation I'd folly."</p>

<p>"What is't?" says they.</p>

<p>I continued, "What can be more interestin' and dignifyin'
to a lovely young creetur in my distressin' circumstances
than to impart construction to the risin' gineration

<!-- page 54 -->

and devil-up the youthful understandin'? so I'm detairmined
to do it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned if I know now what ye mean,"
says Uncle Jonah.</p>

<p>"You gret coot you," says Aunt Huldy says she&mdash;"don't
ye know nothin'? she means she'll teach a siminary;
and now that's jest what Higgins Patent needs to make it
a rael ginteel place."</p>

<p>"Yes," says uncle, "and Permilly's the very one to
do it, for any body that knows so many big words as she
does, ort-to keep a siminary&mdash;and I'll see about it right
off."</p>

<p>Arter tea I retired to my chomber. 'Twas a despot
charmin' moonshiny evenin' and I sot down by the winder,
and the beauty of the prospect, and the stars, and the
moonshine, and the gentle breezes that fanned my cheek,
and the quiosity of natur, and the idee of my own individdyal
sorrers begun to operate so on my immaggination that
I was overpowered with mawlancholy, and so I sung
"blue-eyed Mary," (I was a very purty singer&mdash;I be
yit,) and jest as I'd got done that affectin' line where it
says,</p>

<p class="small">"I now am sorrer's child."</p>

<p>I heern somebody heave a sythe; so I looked out of the
winder, and lo and behold 'twas Philander standin' about
three feet from the winder.</p>

<p>"Enchantin' beein!" says he, "yer music has eny most
annilliated me! enrapurin' tones! ravishin' strains!"</p>

<p>"Oh Jemmeni!" says I, "I'm sure I shall faint away.
I'm so flustered seein' you here; if you'd only gone off
without syin' or sayin' nothin' 'twould a ben jest like Lord

<!-- page 55 -->

Mortimer's seein' Amandy the fust time, and hearin' of her
sing unbeknown to her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" says he, "if his surprise and delight had a ben
as gret as mine he couldent a went off without some kind
of exclamigation, O Miss Ruggles, I'm a lingerin' round
here to bask in the sunshine of your presence, and here's
the dear flower you giv me&mdash;I've gazed on it ever sen."</p>

<p>"Massy!" says I, "I see ye heave it away when ye
got along a-piece, and I should like to know what made
ye kick up and laff so. I reckoned ye'd got the highsterics."</p>

<p>"Not so," says he, " 'twas a conniption-fit&mdash;I'm subject
to 'em arter beein' overcome as I was when I fust see
you&mdash;when I recovered I returned and pickt up this
flower."</p>

<p>Says I, "It looks as fresh as if you'd jest pickt it off this
ere vine."</p>

<p>"I've kept it fresh," says he, "with my tears while it
was stickin' in the buttonhole nighest my heart."</p>

<p>"I entreat you to depart and leave me," says I;
Amandy used to very often send Lord Mortimer off.</p>

<p>"Sweetest of maidens!" says Philander says he, "I
obey your high bequest." So sayin' he vanished and disappeared,
and I took my pencil and paper and writ the
follerin' "stanzys by moonlight."</p>

<div class="small">

<p>In my distractin' sittyation,<br/>

<p>NEXT mornin' whilst we was eatin' breckfast, Uncle
Jonah he says to me, says he, "Permilly."</p>

<p>Says I "hay?"</p>

<p>Says he, "I went all round last night a gittin'
scholars for you and everybody was astonished when I
toll'd 'em about ye, for nobody didn't know you was here,
and Missis Peabody, and Missis Dickens, and Missis Jones,
and Missis Doty, and Missis Higgins, (if she gits done
making soap in time) and their husbands, is a coming here
this arternoon to see ye."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" says I, "I wish ye hadn't a went so soon
for my chist han't cum, and I han't nothin' to put on."

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>"Well," says he, "it can't be helpt now&mdash;them are
wimmin don't want to send their dorters to school to a
person they han't seen, so you must jest fix up the best
way you can, and do yer purtiest."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "but where's my siminary to be
loquated?"</p>

<p>"In deacon Peabody's chomber," says he, "he's got a
master gret room, and we'll jest put some benches into't,
and ittle be jest the thing; and you must write an advertysement,
and I'll stick it up in Doty's bar-room." So
arter breckfust I went into my room and writ the follerin'
advertysement:</p>

<p>"Miss Ruggles, racently from Podunk, bein' obligated
by unrecountable misfortins to lobsquander from the hum
of her childhood, and desirin' to devairt her mawlancolly
mind sumhow&mdash;would conform the inhabiters of Higgins
Patent, and its civinity, that she has resolved to instruct a
siminary of young wimmin, or shemales, from six years
old along up. Miss R. would insure the public of her
complete comptitude to undertake this undertaking and
han't no doubt she'll giv gineral satisfication. Besides
understandin' all the branches that's taught in any siminary
she will larin 'em to paint on velvet, and to be perlite, and
she don't want nobody to think she's a going to do it for
money, for she dispises remoneyration, and only jest wants
to teach to pervent herself from sinkin' in despair. She
caliates to begin on Monday the 15th of June."</p>

<p>I hadn't more'n got it writ afore I heerd a racket, and I
lookt out of the winder, and lo and behold, 'twas Obadiah
Coggsdil&mdash;thunderin' along with a waggin load of tin
pans and lanterns, &amp;c., and as much as forty folks arter
him&mdash;for tin pedlars didn't cum to Higgins Patent often

<!-- page 58 -->

and when they did cum the folks made a gineral time on't.
He stopt afore uncle Jorrockses, and all the people gathered
round to egzamin' his stuff, and he was so bizzy
praisin' of 'em up that I begun to be afeard he'd forgot my
chist. Byme by says one on'em,</p>

<p>"What ye got in this gret box?"</p>

<p>Says Obadiah says he, "That are's a chist of clus old
Ruggleses folks sent out to their Milly; she run off without
takin' anything with her, and I wouldn't a brung the
plaguy thing if I hadn't a ben a frind of the old man. I
tell'd 'em if I was them I wouldn't send the slut nothin',
for she don't desarve to be treated no how."</p>

<p>You never see a madder creetur than I was that minnit&mdash;for
there was some of the fust folks in the village
standin' there, and says one on 'em to another one,</p>

<p>"Why, Squire Jones, this must be the same young
woman that's a guayne to teach the siminary."</p>

<p>"Sure enuff, deacon;" says he, "and I say we'd better
make the feller tell all about her, for he seems to know&mdash;what
do you think about it, Dr. Davis?"</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "I think we'd or't to find out the

to a person that ain't respectable, if, she's ever so accomplished."</p>

<p>"No more don't I," says Squire Jones&mdash;"nor I
nyther," says all the rest.</p>

<p>I tell ye I couldn't hold in no longer; so I stuck my
head out of the winder, and says I, "Misters!" They
all lookt up, and when they see me they was bethunderstruck;
and I must a lookt very strikin'&mdash;had a gret big
lalock stuck in my head, and my pen that I'd ben a writin'
with in my hand, and I streched out the hand that had the

<!-- page 59 -->

pen in, and laid t'other on my heart, and was jest a guayne
to begin when Obadiah he see me and says he,</p>

<p>"Golly! Miss Ruggles, is that you? well, I've fetched
yer old chist"&mdash;</p>

<p>What else he signed to say I don't know, for Dr. Davis
took holt on him and shook him and says he,</p>

<p>"Stop yer yaw-hawin; don't ye see the lady's guayne
to speak."</p>

<p>So he stopt and I begun agin, and addrested 'em as
follers: "Gentlemen&mdash;as ye don't know nothin' consairnin'
me only what you've heern from this ere ignorant
creetur, I spose you must intertain straunge idees about
me; but if you knowd what I've underwent to hum&mdash;if
you knowd my afflictions and mawltreatment, you wouldn't
blame me nun for lobsquanderin', nor ye wouldn't listin a
minnit to the agrogious disrepresentations this villing promulgates,
and if you'll call on me this arternoon I'll tell
ye the hull of my history from eend to eend."</p>

<p>So they convairsed together a spell and then Dr. Davis
he stept out from the middle on 'em, and says he,</p>

<p>"We'll do ourselves the honor of calling on Miss Ruggles
this arternoon."</p>

<p>So sayin' he hysted his hat and made a low bow, and I
made a curchy, and the men they went hum, but I obsairved
Dr. Davis look back at me in admireation, and I
knowd he was besmitten at fust sight; but thinks me, it
won't do to incurridge him, for my affections is unrecoverably
gin to another; (Dr. Davis was a widdyer, a very
nice, smart man&mdash;very much set by&mdash;and an oncommon
good physicianer too.) Well, Uncle Jonah he went out
and brung in my chist, and then I read my advertysement
to him and his wife, and they said 'twas fust rate, and uncle

<!-- page 60 -->

he telld me to write four or five on 'em to stick up in the
towns round there. So I did&mdash;and when I'd got 'em writ
I reckoned twas time to habiliate myself for the company
that was a comin' to see me, so I onlocked my chist, and
took out a white dimity with a long short with a blue ribbin'
round the botton on't, and put it on, and tied a red
sash round my waist; then I took and tied a yaller
ribbin round my head and stuck a number of mornin'
glories in it; then I huv a pink silk long shawl round my
neck, and my twilight was completed. So you see I didn't
depart from the elegant simplicity always conspicious in
my dress. Arter dinner I went and sot down in the
square room and purty soon I heerd a master loud talkin'&mdash;so
I looked out, and 'twas Dickens, and Jones, and
Peabody, and Doty, and their wives, and Dr. Davis, a
cornin' up the hill; so I fixed myself in a reclinin' poster,
and took the Childern of the Abby and begun readin'.
Purty soon they knockt, and Aunt Huldy she hollered,
"Walk in"&mdash;so in they all cum, and aunt she introduced
us, and the gentlemen made bows, and the ladies and me,
we made curchys to one another, and we all said we
hoped for better acquaintence. Arter talkin' about the
weather a spell, says Missis Peabody says she,</p>

<p>"So you're a guayne to set up siminary, hay?"</p>

<p>"I sign to," says I, "if I can git patternage."</p>

<p>Says Missis Dickens says she, "we've all agreed to send
our dorters to ye, but we've heern ruther an onfavorable
account on ye from a tin pedlar from your place."</p>

<p>Says Deacon Peabody says he, "my wife and I we thot"&mdash;says
Missis Peabody, interruptin' of him&mdash;"I telld
Mr. Peabody that seein' you was a guayne to teach in our
chomber if you was raly sich an obstropelous young

<!-- page 61 -->

woman as the pedlar toll'd for&mdash;'twould bring reproach on
our house, and Mr. Peabody's ben deacon risin' 20 year,
and has always been lookt up to by the hull town, so says
I, Deacon, I guess we'll go and larn the truth on't."</p>

<p>Says Deacon Peabody says he, "I says to Missis Peabody,
says I, it looks kinder suspicious."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," says she, " 'twas me said it to you&mdash;says
I, Deacon, says I, it seems to me it looks kinder suspicious
for a young woman to come here and keep herself so
scerce for more'n a week. I reckon we'd or't to know more
about her afore we giv her our chomber to teach in." So
they kept on continuyin' talkin' for ever so long, and at last
says Dr. Davis says he,</p>

<p>"We cum for the purpose of hearin' Miss Ruggleses
explanigation, and if the ladies can cum to a ceesation for
a spell, we'll listen to her."</p>

<p>So I with my eyes cast down&mdash;my face diffused with
blushes&mdash;with a mournful sythe, begun:</p>

<p>"MY FRIENDS:&mdash;My history is uncomboundably misfortinate.
I concurred the displeasure of a cruel and torranical
father, by bein' unwillin' to unite my destination
with a creetur I couldn't belove, for I couldn't experience
for him the uncontrolable affection that is desirable to render
the mattermonial state agreeable, and I'd cum to a
detairmination not to have nobody that want as pleasin'
and elegant as Lord Mortimer, the young man this ere
charmin' book tells about, (here I took and kist the Childern
of the Abby,) and he want no more like him than a
punkin's like a potater, and you will sairtinly compatigate
my sorrers when I conform you that my unfeelin' parent
even thretened to confound me in a gloomy dungin if I

<!-- page 62 -->

didn't obey his onreasonable command; and who, I ax,
wouldn't, when circumstances arrove to sich a pitch&mdash;who
wouldn't, if she'd the least jot of sensibility&mdash;who
wouldn't elop from the paternal ruff, and seek a sylum in
a distant land? Alas!" says I, raisin' my eyes swimmin'
in tears, and layin' my hand on my bustin' heart&mdash;"I
lobsquandered to this place, hopin' to spend my time in
unbeknown sequestration&mdash;intendin' to wander in these
inspirin' woods, givin' ritteration to my woes in poetry&mdash;
for I write poetry. But even here I couldn't be let alone,
for I've jist received from my father a pistle charged with a
mandrake to make me go to work immejuntly, or else he'll
remander me back to that dretful dunjin I've jest escaped;
and as I don't desire to employ my fair hands in wroughtin'
at sairvyle labor, I thought, seein' I was intirely qualificient,
I'd teach a simminary."</p>

<p>All the while I was makin' this speech ye never see a
surprisder lookin' set of folks than them I was addressin'&mdash;and
for a spell arter I'd done there wan't a word spoke&mdash;and
Dr. Davis he seemed to be wonderfully affected,
for he turned his face round and lookt out the winder all
the time. At last says Deacon Peabody says he,</p>

<p>"Well, I never heerd sich a master sight of crooked
words in my day. I rather guess my dorter han't no
casion to lairn sich stuff." I s'pose Missis Peabody was a
waitin' to see what opinion the deacon would ixpress so's
to have hern conterary to it, for she broke right in and
says she,</p>

<p>"I ruther guess, mister Deacon Peabody, ittle be as I
say. My Mirandy shall go to this ere young woman's
school, for I never heerd nobody use eleganter language
in my life, so you may shet yer head."</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>I tell ye the deacon did shet up his head and lookt as
if he wished he hadn't opened it. As soon as Missis Peabody
ixprest her mind the rest of the wimmin up and
agreed with her, and it was purty ivident that she was the
rulin' woman in Higgins Patent. They all on 'em said
they'd patternise me, and the men they lookt purty grumpy,
but they darsent say a word.</p>

<p>After a spell, says Deacon P. says he, "I guess we'd
better be goin'."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I ain't a guayne to be in no hurry,"
says his wife, "you may go as soon as you please, tho'."</p>

<p>"So may you," says Missis Dickens to her husband.</p>

<p>"So may you," says Missis Doty to hern.</p>

<p>"So may you," says Missis Jones to the squire, and so
the men folks went off, and the wimmin stayed. "Now
do take off yer things and stay to tea," says Aunt Huldy.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't cum to stay," says Missis Peabody.</p>

<p>"Nor I nyther," says Missis Dickens.</p>

<p>"Me nyther," says Missis Jones.</p>

<p>"No more didn't I," says Missis Doty.</p>

<p>"But I don't know but I'll stay," says Missis Peabody.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I will," says all the others.</p>

<p>So they took off their things, and purty soon every one
on 'em hawled out their nittin' work, and I tell ye, they
want nun on 'em slow to talk&mdash;but I can't spend time to
tell about their visit. In the evenin' arter they'd all gone,
I went out to take a walk, and as I went by the housen
everybody cum to the doors and winders to look at me,
and when I past by Dr. Davises office I see him a peekin'
out, and I pitied him amazinly, for I see he was despotly
took with me&mdash;and thinks me, I'd ort to let him know
right off that his case is hopeless. So I went into the

<!-- page 64 -->

woods and took my pencil and paper and writ the follerin'
billet:</p>

<p>"RESPECTABLE DOCTOR:&mdash;It is with compunctious distress
that I conform you I never can be yourn&mdash;my affections is
gin, incondubitably gin to another&mdash;I'm plighted to Philander&mdash;try
to forgit me I boseech on ye&mdash;may that peace
and happiness you so truly desairve to possess be yourn&mdash;and
may they never agin meet with sich conterruptions as
they have received from the unable but pittyin'*<br/>

"PERMILLY RUGGLES."</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby, chap. 17.]</p>

<p>When I'd writ it I went and huv it into his office winder,
and then I went back into the woods to ponderate. So I
sot down on a log under a tree, and whilst I was a thinkin'
I heerd sumbody sythe, and I lookt round and, lo and
behold, 'twas Philander leanin' agin a tree with his honkercher
up to his eyes. So I goes up to him and says I,
takin' hold of his hand, "Philander, why so mawlancolly?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" says he, "lovliest of created bein's, I must
leave you."</p>

<p>"Leave me!" says I, "I shall sairtin faint away; do
ketch me!" So he led me to a log, and I sot down, and
says he, "Compose yerself, my anngel."</p>

<p>Arter a spell says I, "I've composed myself, now perceed."</p>

<p>And says he, "I'm obleejed to depart."</p>

<p>And says I, "Don't for massy's sake tell me where yer
a guayne,&mdash;for 'twont be half so interestin' as 'twill to be
in onsairtinty consairnin ye."</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>"Well then," says he, "let me jest tell ye we must
part for a number of months,&mdash;perhaps a year,&mdash;and oh!
my charmer! can you remember me?"</p>

<p>"Gracious!" jackleated I, "don't ye know yer Permilly's
heart is oncapable of bein' faithless?"</p>

<p>"I can't doubt it," says he, "but it's enuff to split my
heart,&mdash;it's like cuttin' me into inch pieces to bid ye farewell!
but it must be so." So he prest me to his bussom
and went groanin' off; but afore he'd got fur I happened
to think and says I, "Stop a minnit, Philander, don't ye
know when Lord Mortimer went away he gin Amandy his
picter, and I want yourn."</p>

<p>"Alas!" says he, "I han't nun; but I can make one
in a minnit." So he took a piece of paper out of his
pocket, and took my pencil and drawd a head on't and gin
it to me.</p>

<p>"Why," says I, "that don't look nun like you."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does," says he, "it's exact,&mdash;you'll see by
daylight." So I took it, and then arter takin' another
farewell he departed, and I sunk down on the log overpowered.
But then I was comforted in thinkin' how much
our partin' was like Lord Mortimer's and Amandy's&mdash;so
sudding&mdash;and how much they underwent when they was
apart, and how it did seem as if they never would meet
agin; and thinks me, mabby ittle be jest so with us,&mdash;no
knowin'&mdash;but any how it's to be expected. I'll take on
while he's gone,&mdash;so arter sheddin' a cropious flood of
tears, I writ the follerin stanzys:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>He's gone, I'm sure I don't know where,<br/>

Nor when he'll come agin;<br/>

And there's no tellin' what dispair<br/>

My droopin' heart is in!</p>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>And! dear me sus! when we're apart<br/>

If he forgits Permilly,<br/>

'Twill sairtin break her lovin' heart,<br/>

And make her brain grow chilly.</p>

<p>Murder! can he be false to me?<br/>

I'd kill me if he should&mdash;<br/>

But no! I guess he'll constant be,<br/>

Because he vowed he would.</p>

<p>But goody gracious! what shall I<br/>

Do when he's gone away?<br/>

On this ere log I'll sit and cry,<br/>

And sythe and groan I say.</p>

</div>

<p>When I'd got this poitry writ the moon was a shinin',
and I reckoned it must be purty late, so I went hum, and
when I went by Dr. Davises office I heerd him a talkin'
and laffin consairnedly with sumbody that sounded jest
like Philander,&mdash;but I'd no idee 'twas Philander&mdash;for he
felt too distresst to laff, and I reckoned the doctor hadn't
found my billet yet, for if he had he couldn't a felt so
cherful.</p>

<p>Arter this there want nothin' worth relatin' took place
in several days till I begun my school,&mdash;only I writ the
follerin' epigranny one night whilst I was a gazin' on the
minnyture of my absent Philander:</p>

<p class="small">He feared that I'd forget him quite,<br/>

As soon as he got out of sight&mdash;<br/>

He wouldn't think me so vile<br/>

If he should see me ev'ry night<br/>

By moonshine or by candle light,<br/>

<p>AS soon as Aurory had opened the porticos of the
horizon, the fair Permilly ariz and arranged her
attire&mdash;for 'twas the momentuous mornin' that
her siminary was guayne to begin. I put on a
yaller streeked open gownd with a flounce round it, and a
long green sash round my waist, and a blue crape turbin
on my head, with one long black ostridge feather stuck in
it, then I put my pink silk long shawl round my neck,
and then condescended down into the breckfust room.</p>

<p>Arter breckfust Uncle Jonah he gin me his watch, sayin'
I'd need a time-piece in school. 'Twas an extrornary gret
silver watch&mdash;don't see no sich big watches now-days.
So I tied it to a red ribbin and hung it round my neck,
and 'twas so big I couldn't stuff it under my sash, so I let
it hang outside. Bein' all ready for a start I happened to
think how't I or'to carry Philander's picter with me all
the time, and what to do I dident know, for I was afeard
'twould get rubbed out. So I went to Uncle Jonah and
axed him if he hadn't sum kind of a small flat box he
could lend me (didn't tell him what I wanted on't&mdash;hadn't
said a word to him nor Aunt Huldy about Philander).
So he went to his chist and hawled out a tin tobaccer

<!-- page 68 -->

box with a snap to it and axed me if 'twould do.
"That are's the very thing." So I put the picter in't,
and jammed it under my sash, and took my parrysol and
set out for school, and as I went by the housen 'twas curus
to see the folks peekin' out and exclaimin', "There goes
the new school-marm. Did you ever!" and sich like.</p>

<p>Well, I cum to the deacon's and Missis Peabody she
cum to the door and showed me the way into the school-room,
and you never heerd sich a racket as there was
there afore I went in, but as soon as they see me they
was as still as mice. There was about thirty gearls there,
and a number cum in arter I did, so't I had forty-seven in
the hull, and sum on 'em was purty big; so I made the
big ones set on one side and the leetle ones on 'tother side,
and arter I'd got 'em all arranged, says I, "Siminary's
begun:" and then I made 'em read round in the English
Reader. Arter they'd read, I axed 'em if they'd ever syphered,
and they all said "No." So I tell'd 'em to take
their slates, and I was surprised to find out that more'n
half on 'em couldn't make figgers&mdash;so I tell'd 'em to take
the rethmetic and copy 'em out on't.</p>

<p>"Now," says I, "make one side of yer slates jest as
full of figgers as ittle hold." So they did; and then says
Mirandy Peabody says she, "What shall we do next?"</p>

<p>"Don't ye know nothin'?" says I, "make t'other side
full." So they did: and then says Mirandy, "What next?"</p>

<p>"Rub 'em out," says I, "and put up yer slates; ye've
syphered enuff for one day; the big ones may go out
whilst I hear the little ones spell," (for spellin' I always
tho't was the most importinate part of eddycation:) so I
made the little gearls stand up in a row, and I took a spellin'
book in one hand and a switch in t'other, and says I,

<!-- page 69 -->

"Now the fust one that misses shall be whipt and go to the
foot."</p>

<p>"Well," says Drusilly Doty, says she, "what will be
did to me if I miss?" (she was to the foot.)</p>

<p>"Nun of yer sarce," says I. Well the fust time round
they all spelt right but Philandy Dickens, and I did as I
said I would to her. Next time round I put out "grub,"
to Hepsy Hawkins; she was to the head, and says she,
"g-r-w-eb, grub."</p>

<p>"There aint no sich letter as 'eb,' " says I, "go down
to the foot." So she started and run as fast as ever she
could so's I couldn't git a chance to whip her. "Now,
Hepsy Hawkins," says I, "to pay for that are trick of
your'n you shall always be in a class by yerself."</p>

<p>"Good!" says she, "then I shall always be at the
head."</p>

<p>"Go long and set on the floor under the table," says I.
So she went and then I put it out to Bricy Stokes and she
spelt it right. "Now," says I, "what's the meaning
on't?" Bricy couldn't tell, nor nun of the rest on 'em.
So says I, "What eats up the cabbages?"</p>

<p>"Why, folks," says Bitty Bickets.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "what eats 'em up when they're
growin' in the garding?"</p>

<p>Says she, "The critters gits in and eat 'em sumtimes."</p>

<p>"Don't ye know nothin'?" says I, "why worms eats
'em and worms is grubs."</p>

<p>"Now," says Melissy Peabody, "I know what for
father says every day how't we're all worms&mdash;it's cause
we eat sich a master sight of cabbages."</p>

<p>"Set down," says I, "every one on ye; ye talk so

<!-- page 70 -->

much there an't no sich thing as hearin' on ye spell."
Arter a spell I tell'd 'em they might go out and send the
big ones in. So they run hollerin' and yellin' and tearin'
down stairs, and it did seem as if the hull house would
cum down. Thinks me, I'll fix 'em for that. Purty soon
Hepsy Hawkins&mdash;she't was under the table&mdash;says to
me:</p>

<p>"Miss Ruggles, maytent I go out?"</p>

<p>"No, ye maytent," says I.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was sassy," says she, "I won't be never
agin if ye'll lemme go out."</p>

<p>"Well, go," says I. Whilst she was guayne, says I,
"Ye'll never be sassy agin, <i>hay?</i>"

<p>"No, <i>straw</i>" says she, and cut out of the door.
Thinks me, she'll git it! Well, the big gearls cum in and
I axed 'em if they'd ever studied grommer. Most on 'em
said they had sum. "Well," says I, "it's best to be
pairfect in't; and seein' you've studied sum afore, ye may
lairn half way through at once so's to git done quick and
go to parsin'." So they went to studyin' and I went to
the door and call'd the little ones in, and arter I'd holler'd
to 'em I went behind the door and as fast as each one cum
in I hit her a cuff, and when Hepsy Hawkins cum in I
took and slung her round and round, and made her go
back under the table. Well, they all yell'd and bellered
like split; you never heerd sich a racket, I'm sartin.
Purty soon I lookt at my watch and see 'twas time to let
out, so I tell'd 'em they might go hum, and they all went
only jest about a dozen that brung their dinners; I'd brung
mine tew&mdash;for 'twas most a mild to Uncle Jorrockses&mdash;so
I took it out of my undispensible and eat it. It subsisted
of two slices of bread and butter stuck together, a

<!-- page 71 -->

hunk of cheese, a pickle, and an apple turnover. That
was all the dinner I took, for I never had no great of an
appetite&mdash;bein' like Amandy, ye know she only took sum
"slight refreshments"&mdash;and whilst I was eatin' thinks
me, I wonder if Amandy had sich a tussle gittin' along
with her school as I do; I'll look into the Childern of the
Abby when I get hum and see, for I've eny most forgot;
my memory's ruther forgitful sumtimes, but O! I never
shall forgit my Philander. So I took out my tobaccer box
and lookt at him. Arter "gazin' on't with agonizin' tenderness"*
for a spell, and syin' and groanin' and kissin'
on't, I put it back, and I see all the gearls a whisperin'
and wonderin'; so says I to 'em:</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby, chap. 17.]</p>

<p>"O gearls! the belovedest and vallyablest thing I've
got is in this ere box."</p>

<p>"What is it?" says they, "and what makes ye cry and
groan over it so?"</p>

<p>"Ax me no questions," says I, "I don't desire to dispose
confidence in nobody."</p>

<p>Well, purty soon the scholars all cum in and I begun
school. Then I made the little ones all take their sowin',
only Hepsy Hawkins and sent her under the table agin,
and she went without makin' a speck of fuss. I see she
had sumthin' under her apern and I axed her what 'twas,
and she said 'twas her spellin'-book. Well, I sot the little
gearls to sowin'; sum on 'em had pieces of calicer to
make bed-kivers on, and sum on 'em had cloth to lairn to
mark letters and make birds and trees on. Then I heerd
the big ones recite in grommer, and they kept a stoppin' for
me to ax 'em questions, but says I, "That an't no way;

<!-- page 72 -->

ye must begin to the beginnin' of yer lesson, and say clean
to the eend on't without stoppin' once." So they tried;
but they made blunderin' work on't&mdash;I had to keep tellin'
on 'em all the time what cum next, and when they got
into cases it cum Sophire Joneses turn and she'd forgot
what cum next. So says I, "Nammi, Possmine, Objine."
Says Sally Ann Higgins, says she, "Miss Ruggles,
what's the meanin' of them are words? they're
master queer!"</p>

<p>Says I, "Miss Sally Ann Higgins, I guess ye ha'n't ben
under very good deseplyne in the schools ye've ben to afore
yit, or ye wouldn't darst to ax yer school-marm questions,
and sich questions! want to know what's the meanin' of
Nammi, Possmine, Objine! Why, its grommer&mdash;that's
the meanin' on't&mdash;so shet yer head."</p>

<p>When they'd got done sayin' grommer I tell'd 'em they
might paint the rest of the arternoon. So they took out
their velvet and paints and cum to I'd forgot my picters&mdash;so
I sent Ann Mariar Dodge down arter 'em and when she
cum back I tho't I'd give 'em Nomy and Ruth for the fust
lesson. So I stuck it up agin the wall and helpt 'em cut
out the theorims, and they begun, and sum on 'em done
very well, but sum made dretful work, 'specially about the
artificial flowers and fethers on Ruth's bunnit, and sum on
'em made Nomy's 'nittin'-work look as if all the stitches
was dropt. Byme-by I tell'd 'em to put up their paintin'
and sowin' and put on their things, for 'twas time to let out
school,&mdash;so they did. Then I tell'd 'em to stand up in a
row all round the edge of the room. "Now," says I,
"clasp yer hands acrost yer waists as I do&mdash;now make
yer monners as I do." Then I made a low curchy, and
they all did jest as I did. "Now," says I, "I shall suspect

<!-- page 73 -->

ye to make yer monners every arternoon when school's
out without my showin' of ye, how&mdash;Siminary's out."
So they all went hum only Hepsy Hawkins&mdash;I made her
stay a spell arter. So I slickt up my table, and then I
call'd Hepsy Hawkins out and says I,</p>

<p>"Be ye sorry for disbehavin' so to-day!" Says she,
"Yis, marm."</p>

<p>Says I, "Won't ye never misconduct so agin?"</p>

<p>"No, marm," says she. "Well then ye may go hum,"
says I. So she ketched her bunnit in less than no time
and run off hum. Then I took my parrysol and walked
off humwards with the greatest deliberosity and dignitude
for I reckon a school-marm can't be tew dignified. Whilst
I was a guayne along every body lookt out of the winder
and lafft, and I met a hull grist of boys guayne hum from
deestrict school, and they hoorawed and clapt their hands.
Thinks me, I wonder if this ere's the way they suppress
their admireation to Higgins Patent. At last when I was
eny most hum I met a young man descendin' up the hill&mdash;
he had yaller hair, and a gret red face and snuff-colored
clus on and a slate under his arm. Well, he stared at me
and jest as I'd got along by says he, "Marm!"</p>

<p>Says I, "Hay!"</p>

<p>Says he, "Did you know there's a dead critter tied to
your sash?"</p>

<p>"Gracious!" says I, "you don't say so." So he stept
up and took it off for me and as true as natur' 'twas an old
dried-up dead hen, and I knowd in a min nit that Hepsy
Hawkins had did it while I was a fixin' my table. I never
in my hull life had anything happen to me that made me
feel so bad as that are did; so I jest sot down on the hill
and begun to cry.</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"Don't take on so," says the strannger, "sich mean
tricks hurts them as does 'em more'n them they're did to.
I wouldn't worry about it, young woman."</p>

<p>"O! dear me suz!" says I, "if Amandy had ever had
a dead hen tied to her I wouldn't care&mdash;but there aint
nothin' in the hull of the Childern of the Abby about a hen
nor any other thing bein' tied to her, tho' she had all kinds
of trouble besides; but goody grevous! my sorrers is bigger
than hern."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know nothin' about Amandy," says he.</p>

<p>"What!" says I, "you hant read the Childern of the
Abby!"</p>

<p>"No, I han't," says he.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "it's time ye did then, and I'll lend it
to ye, for I feel extrornary obleejed to ye for the sairvice
ye've did me, and ye'll have my everlastin' gratitution
for't." So sayin' I waved my hand for him to go&mdash;but
he didn't seem to take the hint, so says I, "Don't you apprehend
that are motion?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," says he.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, " 'twas the same as tellin' of ye to
make yer disappearance." " 'Twas, hay?" says he,
"well, I should like to be better acquainted, marm."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "you can have the felickity of seein'
me by callin' to Mr. Jorrockses,&mdash;for I shall always estimate
ye for disbegagin' of me from that are consairned old
carcass&mdash;but frindship is all I can profferate ye."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll cum there," says he. Then I waved my
hand to him agin, and he understood that time; so he
went off. Well, I got hum, and Aunt Huldy she axed me
how I got along teachin'. "O grandfer grevous!" says
I, "I never had so much trouble in one day in my life."</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p>"Didn't!" says she,</p>

<p>"No, didn't!" says I. So I tell'd her the hull, and
says she, "As for that are hen I shouldn't care tew cents
about it, don't let it giv ye no trouble, darlin'."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, beloved aunt," says I, "sympathy is
sweet in the most deepest affliction." Arter tea I thought
I'd take a walk; so I took my pencil and paper and a
shingle to write on, and winded my way to the very undentical
spot where I parted with Philander, and sittin'
down on a log I writ the follerin' vairses:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>'Twas here I parted with Philander,<br/>

Thro' the wide world he's gone to wander.<br/>

Six times the mornin' sun has rizen<br/>

Sen I beheld that face of hisn.</p>

<p>I've scerce ben able for to speak<br/>

Thro' all this mawlancholly week,<br/>

And sairtin nobody would wonder,<br/>

If they should only see Philander.</p>

<p>So tall, so slender, and so straight,<br/>

So very kerless in his gait&mdash;<br/>

His hair is black&mdash;his hands is white&mdash;<br/>

His voice is sweet&mdash;his eyes is bright.</p>

<p>The sorrers I indure; Good Landy!<br/>

Are like the sorrers of Amandy.<br/>

But whilst I'm blest with sich a beau,<br/>

I'm willin' for to suffer woe.</p>

<p>But whilst he's gone what shall I do?<br/>

Dear suz! how shall I live it through?<br/>

If all the world was mine I'd gin it<br/>

To see my darlin' half a minnit.</p>

<p>Six times the mornin' sun has rizen<br/>

Sen I beheld that face of hisn&mdash;<br/>

And here each night I'll cum and cry,<br/>

I hope we'll meet agin byme-by.</p>

</div>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>Arter I'd writ it I went hum and Aunt Huldy tell'd me
that Missis Wilkins had sent her and me an invitation to
cum to her house the next evenin' to a party.</p>

<p>"I'll go if you do," says I.</p>

<p>"Well, I shall go sartin," says she, "for Widder
Wilkins haint never invited me there afore. She haint
lived to Higgins Patent but 2 or 3 year, and haint took
much notice of the wimmin here. I always reckoned she
felt above us 'cause she's rich and lives purty grand; but
mabby she don't."</p>

<p>Well, bed time cum and I retired to my couch of repose
and fell into a gentle and survivin' slumber and next
mornin' I woke up revigorated and went to my siminary.
Things progranced about as they did the day afore, only
Hepsy Hawkins dident cum, and Mirandy Peabody said
how't Missis Hawkins said she couldn't cum no more
'cause I was partial. I tell ye she'd a got a peelin' if she
had a cum.</p>

</div>

<p>THE second day I kept school as I was a windin' my
way hum I set down under a tree to look at Philander's
pictur. And whilst I was a syin' and
groanin' over it, lo and behold, the same young
man I see the day afore cum along with his slate under his
arm and more'n a hundred boys arter him, cuffin' and
fightin' and throwin' stuns. When the young man see me,
says he, "Yer sarvent, marm."</p>

<p>I bowed to him putty stiff, and he cum right up and sot
down aside of me, and, says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Seems to me ye look mawlancolly, young woman;
hope ye haint had no more trouble to-day."</p>

<p>"Mister," jackleated I, "I beseated myself in this ere
solitary spot to medincate alone, and gaze a spell in rapter
on this dear tresher, the ony thing that perduces me any
satisfaction, and I don't desire to be contruded upon, so I
intreat ye to go off, and whilst you'r about it, jest knock
over ten or a dozen of them are boys," (there was a mess
of the little wretches got on top of the hill and stood there

<!-- page 78 -->

a yellin' at me, "coo-coo-doodle-doo, cluck-cluck-cla-cluck."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "if ye'll show me that are treshure,
as ye call it. I'll clear out." So I handid him the tobacker
box, and arter lookin' at it a minnit, says he, "I swanny!
I don't wonder ye cry when ye look at it, for it's the
consairnedest lookin' thing ever I see. What in natur' do
ye keep it for?"</p>

<p>I grabbd the box and riz up without sayin' a word, and
walked off indignatious.</p>

<p>"Curus cretur, by golly," says the young man; then
he ketcht up a club and took arter the boys, and they all
run hootin' and bellerin' down the hill, and I didn't see
no more on 'em. When I arrove to hum I found Aunt
Huldy beginnin' to rigg for the party, so I begun to fix
tew. And I'll tell ye how I drest; I reckon I never lookt
equal to what I did that evenin', in my life. I put on a
white spencer with short sleeves and blue ribbins tied round
the bottom on 'em, which counterasted finely with my
snowy arms; then I wore a yaller canton crape skeart
with red ribbin loopt up all round the bottom on't, and a
pink sash round my waist. My hair was quirld up on the
tip-top of my head, and confined with a dretful high-toppt
comb, (I've got it now,) and was jest a guayne to put my
artifishel wreath on my head, when thinks me, I wonder
how Amandy'd a fixed her head on sich a casion. So I
took the Childern of the Abby and red where it tells about
her guayne to Missis Kilcorban's ball, and I found she had
on a turbin with sum fethers in't. So I took my green
shawl with sprangles all over it and wound it round and
round my head, and stuck six black ostridge fethers in't.
Then thinks me, I must put a chain to Philander's picter,

<!-- page 79 -->

as Amandy used to have to her mother's&mdash;(wonder she
didn't wear Lord Mortimer's, but I s'pose 'twas so big she
couldent.) So I took a string of glass beads as big as
bullets, and all the different colors ever ye see, and fastened
the box to it and hung it round my alagaster neck.
Jest as Ide finished habiliatin, Aunt Huldy cum in, and
says I, "Aint ye struck with my surpassin' lovliness?"</p>

<p>"Yis, I be," says she; "I never see ye look so putty;
but how do I look?"</p>

<p>"As well as could be expected," anserd I, "from a woman
that's past the moridion of youthful facksination."</p>

<p>"Well, cum on then, if yer ready," says she; "but we
must eat suthin afore we go, tho' I haint no doubt Missis
Wilkins 'll have enuff stuff to eat." So we went into the
kitching and aunt and uncle eat 3 or 4 bowls full of buttermilk
pop, but I dident eat but a little mite. Then I put
on my montle to kiver my clus, so's the folks wouldn't be
starin' at my unresistable elegance along the road, and huv
my leno vail over my head and we sot off. Well, we got to
the place of "rendyvows," and Aunt Huldy and a hull grist
of wimmin that cum in just behind us went into the dressin'-room
to take off their things, but I sot down by a winder
in the hall, and when the wimmin cum out to be rushered
into the parlor, Aunt Huldy she spied me and says
she, "Why don't ye take off yer montle and cum along?"</p>

<p>"Cause nater," says I.</p>

<p>"Why," says she, "they'll think queer on't."</p>

<p>"I don't ker if they do," says I; "I don't want to go
in when everybody else does; besides, I want to set here
and ponderate a spell afore I plunge into the giddy whirlfool
of fluctuation, where there aint no bussom to partickipate
in my sorrers&mdash;nun but cold-hearted strangers; and

<!-- page 80 -->

my belovedest fur away! O let me be!" So she went
in and I was left alone to my solemcolly rumirations. Arter
settin' there a spell I heerd a noise, and purty soon
some folks begun to condescend&mdash;and says one,</p>

<p>"O doctor, I'm half frightend to death!" and says
another, "I'm skairt tew." The door stood on a jar and
they pusht it open and went in. Arter they'd shet the
door thinks me, it's time for me to make my debutte. So
I took off my montle, agested my fethers, and so forth, and
opend the door, and lo and behold, the minister was a
prayin'&mdash;thinks me, I wonder if they always begin their
parties here with prayin'; but I dident ker. So I recoverd
my composher, and with my natral elegance walkt up the
room,* and there was a gineral buz of admireation as I
stept along, and seem' a sofy at the upper eend of the
room and a row of folks standin' up afore it I went along
and squoze into one eend on't. Missis Wilkins was standin'
nigh by and she reacht out and gin me a twitch and says
she, "Miss Ruggles, you've got the bridesmaid's seat."</p>

<p class="small">[*Children of the Abby, chap. 20.]</p>

<p>"The dragon!" says I&mdash;and I gin a spring and jumpt
clear into the middle of the room, and everybody stared at
me to kill. I tell ye I was considerable flustrated. So I
sot down in a cheer and put my fan up afore my face, and
I guess I kept it there a spell. Byme by the minister got
done prayin' and begun marryin' of 'em and thinks me,
I'll giv a look and see who 'tis. So I lookt up and my
wonderation can be better imagginated than discribed,
when I see Dr. Davis a standin' there holdin' holt of Mary
Ann Wilkinses hand! Never in my born days was I half
supprised as I was that minnit; but I knowd that Davis

<!-- page 81 -->

had jest did it out of spite cause I wouldent have him.
There was tew bridesmaids and tew groomsmen, but I
dident know ary one on 'em&mdash;but one of the groomsmen
lookt eny most egzactly like Philander, ony he hadent no
whiskers. Purty soon the serrymony was over, and they
begun to lead up the folks to kiss Mary Ann, and jest then
sum body gin me a hunch on my elbow, and I lookt, and
lo and behold, 'twas the yaller-headed young man that
ontied the dead hen, and thinks me, he's a takin' arter me
jest as Sir Charles Bingley did arter Amandy, and I must
treat him decent as she did him&mdash;tho' I can't incurridge
him.</p>

<p>"Good evenin' to ye, Miss Ruggles," says he.</p>

<p>"Good evenin', Sir Charles," says I.</p>

<p>"Golly!" says he, "that aint my name."</p>

<p>"Aint, hay?" says I.</p>

<p>"No!" says he, "my name's Jabez Spriggins&mdash;I
teach the deestreckt school up here."</p>

<p>"Do, hay?" says I.</p>

<p>"You look amazin' honsome to-night," continuyd he.</p>

<p>"O law!" says I, "mabby you think so; and you
don't look much as ye did this arternoon." No more he
dident&mdash;he had on a long tailed pepper and salt summer
coat, thunder and lightnin' jackit, and streeked trowsers.
Then he had sich a master wide ruffle to his shirt with a
wonderful big breast-pin stuck on't&mdash;and his hair was
tallered as stiff as all nater, and hysted up to a peak afore
much as a foot high. He raly lookt surprisin' well.</p>

<p>"Now," says I, "I wish you'd tell me who that are is
that looks so much like Philander?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who ye mean," says he.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "who's that are feller that's leadin' up
Californy Coon?"</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>Says he, "That's Dick Johnson, he goes to Hamilton
Collidge. His payrents lives to the eastard, and he's ben
hum spendin' the vocation. He stopt here on his way back
to collidge so's to be groomsman&mdash;he's a purty wild chap.
That are short feller that's leadin' up Lorindy Rickets is Bill
Johnson, another collidge feller, and that are one with
curly hair is Sam Wilkins, the bride's brother&mdash;he's
mighty perlite to Grashioshy Hawkins, but he keeps a
lookin' at you neverstandin'."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I wish you'd introduct me to Johnson,
for he looks so much like Philander I want to get
acquainted with him."</p>

<p>"Who in the name o' nater is Philander?" says Spriggins,
says he.</p>

<p>"This ere's him," says I, hawlin' out the tobacker box.
But whilst I was a hawlin' it out the string broke and the
box rolld right in amonkst a mess of folks that was a
standin' round the bride.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" says Loisy Hocus, "suthin' cum buntin'
agin my foot." I jumpt up and run, Spriggins he follerd,
but afore I could git it Josh Jones (Dr. Davises student,
a rael mean feller) pickt it up.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;giv that are up!" says I, "it's mine."</p>

<p>"Giv that are up," says Spriggins, "it's Miss Ruggleses."</p>

<p>"Good landy!" says Missis Hawkins, "I want to
know if you chaw tobacker?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," anserd I, "that are box has got a
treshur in't, so jest gin it up."</p>

<p>"Do for grammany's sake open it and see what's in't,"
says Missis Hawkins, (she spited me on account of the
chastigation I gin Hepsy.) So Jones he hawld it out and

<!-- page 83 -->

begun to holler and laff at it and was jest a guayne to hand
it round when Johnson he ketcht it away from him and
without ever lookin' at it gin it to me.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand million thanks," jackleated I, "I might
a knowd that anybody that lookt so much like Philander
in face and figger couldent help resemblin' of him in noblitude
of mind." Johnson's face turnd as red as fire. I
spose he felt dashed to be praised up by sich an interestin'
bein' as I was.</p>

<p>"Now," says I, "I wish sumbody'd recoverate my
box."</p>

<p>So Johnson he rummaged round and found it and gin
it to me, and I put the profyle into't and stufft it under my
sash, and went and sot down in a cheer at the furder eend
of the room. Purty soon Spriggins cum up with the three
fellers and says he,</p>

<p>"I've brung these ere young men for to introduct 'em
to ye&mdash;this ere's Mr. Johnson, Miss Ruggles&mdash;this ere's
Mr. Tomson, and this ere's Mr. Wilkins."</p>

<p>"Yer sairvent, gentlemen," says I, rizin' and makin' a
low curchy.</p>

<p>"Have you ben up to slute the bride!" says Johnson.</p>

<p>"No," says I, "I guess taint best&mdash;ittle ony make the
doctor feel bad." So they all drawd up cheers and sot
down round me. "Don't be supprised Mr. Johnson,"
says I, "if I stare at ye considerable, for you do look
amazinly like sumbody I know."</p>

<p>"O stare as much as ye please," says he, "I like to be
lookt at by the ladies."</p>

<p>"O my conscience!" says Tomson, "I'd giv all my
old shoes to obtain sich a felickity as Johnson enjoys under
the sunbeams of them electrifvin' gorbs!"</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>"So would I," says Wilkins, syin'.</p>

<p>Jest then the cake and stuff cum round to me and Johnson
took off a gret hunk and put it on a plate and gin it
to me.</p>

<p>"Grandfather grievous!" says I, "you don't suspect
me to eat all that are, I hope."</p>

<p>"To be sure," says he.</p>

<p>"Why lay to't," says Spriggins, " 'twon't hurt ye nun."</p>

<p>"I shan't do't," says I, "I don't scerce ever eat anything,
and han't no casion now."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll take sum of the egg-nogg, won't ye!"
says Spriggins, hollerin' at the same time to a nigger
wench that was carryin' round a server full of suthin' to
drink.</p>

<p>"These ere timbles aint full enuff," says Spriggins, so
he emptied tew on 'em together and handed it to me.
Everybody in the room was lookin' at us&mdash;pertickleely at
me. So says I, purty loud, "I tell ye I hant no casion."
Uncle Jonah he was clear acrost the room and he hollered
out,</p>

<p>"Don't tease Milly to let into the vittals and drink;
she's right when she says she han't no casion, for she eat
dretful hearty of buttermilk pop jest afore we cum, and
if she takes down all that are stuff she'll sairtin be sick
abed."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" says I, "that are's the everlastinest lie I
ever heerd in my life."</p>

<p>"So 'tis," says Aunt Huldy. "She ony eat tew bowls
full afore we cum."</p>

<p>I tell ye it did seem as if I should ixpire. "O misery
me!" exclamigated I, "I shall faint away&mdash;do lead me
out into the hall." So Johnson he took holt of one arm and

<!-- page 85 -->

Tomson he took holt of t'other and Wilkins he took my
fan and blowd me, and Spriggins he follered alter groanin'
consairnedly&mdash;half scart out of his wits. And whilst
they was a takin' of me out&mdash;my head bangin' over on
Johnson's sholder&mdash;my fethers fell out of my turbin, and
says I, "Sumbody jest pick up them are ostridge fethers
afore they git stompt on."</p>

<p>"I vanny she aint faint," says Missis Hawkins.</p>

<p>"I be faint tew," says I. So they took me into the
hall and sot me down on the stairs, and sum on 'em blowd
me and sum on 'em stufft smellin' bottles up my nose. Dr.
Davis he felt of my pulse and his hand trembled dretfully,
and tho' my eyes was shot I could tell that he was dretfully
aggitated. Purty soon Jones (mean crittur) he took
and stufft a nastyfetity pill down my mouth and made me
as sick as a dog. So then I cum tew, and I riz up and
says I, "I think I've had about eny most enuff trouble for
one evenin', but I don't ker, I han't had no more'n Amandy
had to Miss Kilcorban's ball, and I know't if my beauty
and merits was less conspiccious, I should escaped it,* and
if sumbody 'll have the carridge drew up I'll return to
Castle Jorrocks."</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby, chap. 20.]</p>

<p>"Bless yer gizzard," says Aunt Huldy, "don't ye know
we cum afoot?"</p>

<p>"Well," says Spriggins, "I'll go hum and git our
waggin if Missis Wilkins will let her nigger boy drive ye
hum."</p>

<p>Wilkins said, "sairtinly." So Spriggins went hum and
putty soon he cum back with his hosses and waggin, and
Johnson and Tomson and Wilkins they helpt me git reddy,

<!-- page 86 -->

and then Spriggins he went out to the waggin and helpt
me in, and says he, "I shan't stay much longer now
you've gone, for there aint a young woman here I care
teppence for but you, and Ide go clear hum with ye if it
want for stayin' to git sum of that are egg-nogg&mdash;but I'll
stop and see ye to-morrer when I go hum from school, if
you're willin'." Thinks me, if he'd a leff out what he said
about the egg-nogg and guayne to school 'twould a ben
jest like what Sir Charles Bingley said to Amandy when
she was guayne away from Missis Kilcorban's ball. So I
giv him permission jest as Amandy did Sir Charles and
then the driver druv off; and 'twas a gret big flambergasted
lumber waggin and it jolted most consairnedly, and
I got knockt round from one side to t'other, and once in a
while I boundid up much as three or four foot into the air,
and I tell ye I was all but did over when I got hum. I
retired immejuntly to my compartment, and huv myself
down in a cheer by the winder, jest as Amandy did. The
woods, slivered by the beams of the moon that rode mojestic
in the furmanent of stars, recalled to my rememberation
the vows of unchanngable regard that had ben utterated
there, so I took my pencil and writ the follerin' poetical
confusion:&mdash;

<p class="small">Good gracious! good gracious! I'm sinkin' with sorrer,<br/>

My sperrits is low and my heart's full of horror,<br/>

The rendyvows joyful of gay dissipation<br/>

Aint no place for me in my sad sittyation.<br/>

And when I'm alone I lament and take on<br/>

Because my Philander's departed and gone.<br/>

The men is all syin' and dyin' about me,<br/>

And declarin' and vowin' they can't live without me.<br/>

But if they pursue me from mornin' to night<br/>

My darlin' Philander I never will slight,<br/>

My dearest&mdash;my slickest&mdash;my lovedest has went,<br/>

Fur&mdash;fur&mdash;from Permilly his steps he has bent.<br/>

His profile is all that is left for to cheer,<br/>

O! grandfather grievous! I wish he was here.*</p>

<p class="small">[*This was arterwards printed in the "Podunk Illuminator."]</p>

<p>Arter a spell Aunt Huldy cum hum, and she cum in to
see how I did&mdash;she had her work-pockit crammin' full of
cake.</p>

<p>"O aunt," says I, "how could ye be so onfeelin' as to
say I eat tew bowls full of buttermilk pop?"</p>

<p>"Cause ye did," says she, "and I'm sure 'taint much
for a hearty young woman to eat, but I'm sorry I telld
on't, seein' ye feel so bad about it; so you jest eat a hunk
of this ere cake, mabby ittle chirk ye up."</p>

<p>So I took ruther a small sized hunk and eat it, and
Aunt Huldy she went out&mdash;and then fatigewd and distrest
I huv off my splendid habileations, flung myself on my
couch and arter a spell closed my tearful gorbs in a refreshin'
and recomposin' slumber.</p>

<p>The roosters was crowin' to wake up the folks,<br/>

And dry up the dews that besprangled the oaks,<br/>

When the lovely Permilly got out of her bed.</p>

<p>ME.</p>

</div>

<p>THE mornin' arter the weddin' I got up the minnit I
waked, cause Jabez Spriggins was a guayne to
call on me on his way to school, and his school
begun airlier'n mine&mdash;so I hurried and drest me
afore breckfust&mdash;I drest very plain that mornin'&mdash;dident
put no riggin' whatsoever on my head, but I let my hair
in its own natyve and glossy hue float over my sholders,*
but I couldent make it quirl nun to save my gizzard,
though I put it up in papers, and tin, and everything else:
and I wondered, and do yit, what made Amandy's hair always
hang in graceful stringlets over her sholders; but I
was detairmined Ide let mine hang down for once whether
or no. Then I put on my blue calicer long-short, with a
yaller skirt under it, hung my watch round my neck, and
was just a guayne to put Philander in my pocket, when
thinks me, Ile look at it fust. So I opened the box, and
lo and behold, the picter was intirely rubbed out&mdash;they'd
fingerd it so much the night afore to Missis Wilkinses.
So I took a pen and draw'd it over agin as nigh like t'other

<!-- page 89 -->

as I could. Jest as Ide got it draw'd, Aunt Huldy cum to
the foot of the stairs and hollerd to me to cum to breckfust.
So I condescended down, and as soon as ever Uncle
Jonah see me, says he,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby.]</p>

<p>"Land o' liberty! Permilly, what in the name of nater
have ye got yer hair all raked down so for? it looks like
the dragon!"</p>

<p>"It don't nyther," says Aunt Huldy, says she, "it
looks jest like the young wimmin's in the novels&mdash;so you
jest hold yer jaw."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I don't ker what nobody says about
it; for it's fixed putty much as Amandy did hern, and she
knowd what was what, and I don't think men has any bizness
to meddle with wimmin's dress, specially them that
don't know nothin' about nothin'."</p>

<p>"I vum!" says Uncle Jonah, says he, "Permilly's
ruther warm&mdash;wife, can't ye give her a little buttermilk
pop to cool her off?"</p>

<p>"Nun of yer sarce about buttermilk pop," says Aunt
Huldy&mdash;so sayin', she gin him a grip, but he deluded her
grasp, and grabbin' a hunk of short cake he cut out
doors, and then he stuck his head into the winder, and
says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye better both on ye take a chaw of tobacker out of
Milly's box. I reckon ittle callum yer minds." So sayin'
he run off, and says aunt, says she, "That are's the provokinest
creetur ever I see, and the wost on't is he never
gits mad. I wish I had a little of Missis Peabody's grit.
I tell ye I'd stir him up then&mdash;he wouldn't darst to pester
me so." Jest then I looked up and see Spriggins a cummin'
over the hill. "There!" says I, "he's a cummin'."</p>

<p>Aunt Huldy she lookt out and says she, "O, that are's

<!-- page 90 -->

Jabez Spriggins; and cum to think on't, seems to me he
took a master shine to you last night."</p>

<p>"I know it," says I, "and I don't know what to do
with the creetur; Amandy always used Sir Charles Bingly
well, but when she wouldent have him he eeny most
died."</p>

<p>"Good landy!" says Aunt Huldy, "you don't mean to
sairve him so I hope. He's a nice stiddy young man as
ever was, and his father's got a rael productyve farm, and
nary child in the world ony Jabez, and his payrents set a
nation store by him&mdash;he's always ben a master hand to
study&mdash;ben to school evry winter till he's got to be the
best arithmeticker in town&mdash;and now he keeps the deestrict
school, and I tell ye what, ye can't do better'n to
take him if he axes ye, but good now! I wonder if he
haint got a dead creetur tied to him."</p>

<p>"Yer granny's a dead creetur as much!" says I,
"why, them are's my ostridge fethers stickin' out of his
pocket."</p>

<p>Putty soon he began knockin' to the door. "You go
to the door," says Aunt Huldy, "you look slicker'n I
do."</p>

<p>"No, no," says I, "that aint accordin' to etiquit&mdash;you
go, and when he axes for me, you cum out and call
me." So she went and rushered him in, and arter a spell
says he, "Where's that are young woman that's here?"
I was a waitin' in the kitching, and aunt she screamed out
and says she, "Hullo, Milly! he's axed arter ye." I was
kinder mad to hear her up and yell so, but I went in, and
arter we'd sluted one another, says aunt says she, "Did I
do that accordin' to gunter?"</p>

<p>"No!" says I, "you'd orto come out and called me
instid of hollerin' at me so consairnedly."</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>"Well," says she, "I'll know how next time." Then
she went out, and says I to Spriggins, "Well, how did
ye enjoy yerself last night arter my departer?"</p>

<p>"O, middlin'," says he, "I got a putty good chance at
the egg-nogg and stuff&mdash;but I don't like to see folks act
as they did. Arter the old people went hum the young
folks carried on like sixty. The fellers they got yer ostridge
fethers and stuck 'em behind their ears, and caperd
round and hollered, 'Hooraw for the <i>pink of Podunk!</i>'
and the bride said she thought you'd or'to teach faintin'
away in your siminary, and the gearls all on 'em did act
consairnedly. I tried ever so long to git yer fethers, and
couldn't. At last Johnson took 'em and laid 'em on the
table, and as soon as I got a chance I ketcht' 'em unbeknown
to nobody and cum off."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I'm unexpressibly obleejed to ye for
dooin' on't&mdash;but I don't ker teppence for what the gearls
said, for I know 'twa'nt nothin' but envye&mdash;but them are
students, I raly think 'twas strannge they should act so,
seein' they was so took with me."</p>

<p>"I wish every one on 'em was lickt," says Spriggins.
"As I was comin' by there this mornin'," continyd he, "I
see 'em all a standin' round Davises office door, and I was
a goin' straight by, but Tomson he yell'd out and says he,
'Hullo, Jonathan! where ye guayne?' Wilkins he gin
him a hunch, and says he, 'Why, Tomson, that's Mr.
Spriggins that you saw last night.' 'Ah!' says Tomson,
'excuse me, Mr. Spriggins, I thought 'twas an old
acquaintance of mine.' 'O ho!' says Johnson, 'I see
you've got Miss Ruggleses fethers in yer pocket.' 'Yis,'
says I, 'and I'm a guayne to carry 'em to her&mdash;she's a
mazin' putty young woman accordin' to my notion.' 'So

<!-- page 92 -->

she is,' says they&mdash;'but,' says Jones, 'you mustent tell
her how we acted last night.' 'I will, by gosh,' says I.
'O don't,' says Johnson, 'we only frisked round a little
with her fethers to please the ladies, you know they're all
jealous of Miss Ruggles 'cause she's so honsome and interestin'&mdash;don't
tell her.' 'I will, I swonny,' says I.
'Well, then,' says Tomson, 'tell her and be darned to ye&mdash;we're
all a guayne to see her this evenin' for we've all
fell in love with her&mdash;and we'll convince her to the conterary.'
Then I cum off, and Johnson he hollered to me,
'Take care how you take arter her if you don't want to
fight a duel with us.' 'Golly!' says I, 'do you think ye
can all on ye git her?' and whilst I was a cummin' along
thinks me, I'll be hanged if I won't up and ax her to have
me&mdash;and I tell ye what, Miss Ruggles&mdash;I aint a jokin'
when I say I set more by ye and like ye better'n ary
young woman ever I knowd&mdash;for I took a notion to ye
the very day I fust see ye, when I ontied the dead hen,
and if you'll have me I'll have you, and we'll have one
another. What do ye say to't?"</p>

<p>"Grandfer Griffin!" says I, "is that are the way you
prepose yerself?"</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "ain't that are the right way?"</p>

<p>"I've got as gret a mind," says I, "as ever I had to
eat&mdash;no-&mdash;as ever I had not to eat, to go right strait
off out of your socierty without dainin' to give ye any anser&mdash;but
seein' you've did me tew or three good turns,
and as I intertain a gret steem for yer caracter I won't do't&mdash;and
here's the Childern of the Abby, the book I promised
to lend ye, and do ye take it hum and pruse it attentyvely,
specially the 8th chapter, fust vollum, and there
ye'll lairn how to offer yer hand and heart&mdash;and arter

<!-- page 93 -->

you've lairnt how ye may cum and ax me agin if yer a
mind tew&mdash;my astonishment that you sho'd have the audackity
to take arter me is only exceeded by my surprise,
and I sha'n't say yes nor no to yer supposition till ye lairn
to promulgate it better." So sayin' I riz up to go out,
and jest as I got to the door says Spriggins, says he,
"Stop a minnit." So I stopt, and says he, "As fur as
I can understand what you've ben a sayin', I take it ye
won't be put out if I cum to see ye once in a while whilst
I'm readin' this ere book."</p>

<p>"O no!" says I, "Amandy always treated Sir Charles
Bingley with the greatest condescention&mdash;so I give ye
permission to cum." So sayin' I walkt out of the room
as stiff as stillyards, and went up into my chomber and as
I lookt out of the winder I see Spriggins guayne over the
hill readin' in the Childern of the Abby as he went.</p>

<p>Lookin' at my watch I see it lacked a half an hour to
school time, so I sot down and writ with amazin' rappiddity
the follerin' stanzys:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>WELL, I went and put up my dinner and put on my
things, and as 'twas a dretful cloudy mornin' I
reckoned Ide take an umbril&mdash;so I went and axed
Aunt Huldy to lend me thairn; but she said 'twas
a new one and as it looked like for rain she guesst I hadent
better take it for she dident want to have it git wet,&mdash;so I
went without none; but afore Ide got half way there it
begun to rain consairnedly, and seem' Dr. Davises office
door open I run in there, and there was all them fellers

<!-- page 95 -->

and you never see sich a fluster as they made when I cum
in, and I must a lookt amazin' interestin' with my hair all
beshovelled, and my habileations drippin' with moister.
"O dear me suz, gentlemen," says I, "I've got ketcht
in a shower, and if ye'll lend me an umbril I'll be obleejed
to ye." So they all jumpt to git it and then they had
a tussle which sho'd accompanate me&mdash;evry one on
'em wanted to go. At last says Jones (the doctor's
student) says he, "Let Miss Ruggles take her choice."
"Agreed," says they. So says I, "I can git along well
enough without nobody, but seein' ye're so anxious to go
with me Ile choose Mr. Johnson." When I said this the
other fellers ript out a mess of wicked swearin' words, and
shook their fists at Johnson. "Now, gentlemen," says I,
"I boseech on ye not to fight a duil with the favored swine,
for I set store by all on ye, ony I admire Mr. Johnson because
he resembleates my Philander so much." So Johnson
he gin me his arm and we started, when Jones up and says
he, "Miss Ruggles will get her long-short as wet as muck&mdash;Ile
jest bring my surtoot and let her put it on." So he
run and brung his surtoot. That Jones want a very putty
appearin' young man, and I was real pervoked at him for
givin' me the nastyfettity pill at the weddin'&mdash;but when
he was so consairned about me as for to offer me his surtoot,
thinks me, Ile surmount my nantipathy to him. So
they all helpt me on with it and Johnson he buttoned it
round me. "Now," says I, "what's to be did? it's a
master sight too long." Jones was wonderful tall, and his
surtoot was a turrible long drab one with a number of capes
sich as they wore in them days, and I was oncommon short
and fairy-like in my figger.</p>

<p>"Ile tell ye what," says Wilkins, "Ile go behind and
hold it up."</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>"O no, let me," says Tomson.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," says I, "if it's so desirable to go
long of me, s'pose one of ye holds up each skeart."</p>

<p>"Thattle be charmin'," says Wilkins. So they took
holt, and we sot off, and Jones he stood in the door, and
lookt at us. Whilst he was guayne along, says Johnson
says he, "O! the delightsome gratifaction of shelterin' the
most beautifullest of created creeturs from this outragin'
storm!" "Ah, it's exquizzitte!" says Tomson. "It's
the squintessence of pleasure," says Wilkins. And sich
like ixpressions they made all along.</p>

<p>Putty soon we arrove to the deacon's, and bein' quite
late the scholars had all cum and sum on 'em was lookin'
out of the winders, and when they see us they hulloed to
t'others and they all run to the winders to look at us, and
ye never heerd sich a roarin' as they sot up in yer born
days; and when we got into the house they all cum out on
the stairs to see us&mdash;I tell ye I was awful mad to see 'em
so unrespectful, and I should a let right into 'em and
knockt over a few if I hadent a concludid to change my
monner of teachin' a little,&mdash;for that mornin' whilst I was
a dressin' I happen'd to think how't I'd orto look into the
Childern of the Abby to see how Amandy managed her
school&mdash;for Ide forgot, that bein' a part of the novil not
very interestin' to me; so I stopt in the midst of my twilight
and read about it&mdash;and it said she never jaw'd 'em
nor chasigated 'em, but let 'em do jest as they was a mind
to. So I of course detairmined to do so tew. Well, the
young men resisted me to take off the surtoot, and whilst
they was doin' on't, I see Amarilly Peabody, the deacon's
oldest dorter, and Polly Mariar Dawson, (a cousen of hern
visitin' there,) a peekin' through a door and laffin distractidly&mdash;I

<!-- page 97 -->

s'pose they was dretful jelous. O! what a
turrible thing jelousy is! It distils pison into the most
secret and unbeknown recessions of the heart,&mdash;it discomposes
and frusterates the finest affections of natur', and
scatters the firebrands of confusion and purgatory throughout
socierty.</p>

<p>Arter I was disbegaged from the surtoot, says Johnson
says he, "If the rain continys all day we'll cum arter ye
this arternoon."</p>

<p>"O! don't pester yerselves," says I.</p>

<p>"Pester us!" says Wilkins says he, "why, it would
be the most consummit satisfication for us to attend ye
neverstandin' we should git wet to the backbone."</p>

<p>"O!" says Tomson, raisin' his eyes and layin' his
hand on his bussom, "Ide be willin' to kiss yer footprints&mdash;'twould
be exquizzite."</p>

<p>"O landy!" says I, "that wouldent be woth while&mdash;ye
may enjoy the felickity of imprintin' a kiss on my lily
hand"&mdash;so I reacht it out and all on 'em kist it, and says
I, "I intreat that ye won't nun on ye premit yerselves to
intertain hopes that must univittably be disrealised and eend
in disappintment,&mdash;for I may as well conform ye fust as
last, that I'm ingaged to the most charminest swine on
airth." So sayin' I hawled out the tobacker box and kist
it, and put it back agin&mdash;and then makin' a low curchy I
perceeded up chomber, and as I went along I could hear
all the fellers a syin'.</p>

<p>When I went into the school-room the gearls was all
settin' down lookin' jest as if they suspected a knockin'&mdash;but
I went strait to my cheer and sot down, and says I,
"Gearls, I aint a goin' to exercise no more severitude towerds
ye. A number of my puppils has left my siminary,

<!-- page 98 -->

and it must be on account of my extrornary strictness, for
I can't think of nothin' else that could a had an attendancy
to dimminnish my scholers,&mdash;so I sha'n't giv nobody no
furder 'casion to complain of my stairnness." Ye never see
creeturs act as my scholers did that day cause I dident jaw
'em nun&mdash;more'n forty times I was on the pint of cuffin'
sum on 'em; but then Ide happen to think&mdash;so I let 'em
go on jest as they pleased. In the arternoon when the
little ones had went out, and the big ones was a paintin',
and I was givin' Glorianny Stokes sum constructions consairnin'
the picter she was a copyin', ('twas Gineral Putnam
ridin' down the mountin'&mdash;an uncommon splendid
and highly finished picter,) Philindy Ann Higgins hollered
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do look, Miss Ruggles."</p>

<p>"Timothy Titus!" says I, "if that are aint my retinow
a cummin,"&mdash;and sure as creation, 'twas Johnson, and
Wilkins, and Tomson, a cummin' with a hoss to take me
hum. The gearls all snorted out a laffin', and says
Mirandy Peabody, says she, "I never see sich a bony,
scrawny hoss, in my life."</p>

<p>"Shet up!" says I, "it's a sperited, fiery steed."
Then I stuck my head out of the winder, and says I,
"Gentlemen, what for did ye cum so airly? yer altogether
tew punctable,&mdash;but ye may cum in and visit my siminary
if ye want to." So they was a cummin', and says I, "Ye'd
best tie up the hoss fust,&mdash;mabby'll he'll run away."</p>

<p>"Run away!" says Drusilly Potter, "he wouldn't run
away if ye should jam him with a red-hot poker from now
to next never&mdash;it's father's old Billy; he's game legged
and eeny most blind,&mdash;much as a body can do to make
him stir at all."</p>

<!-- page 99 -->

<p>Well, they cum in and sot down, and says I, "Now,
gearls, don't let yer attention be extracted by these ere
young men&mdash;it's very improper." So they all on 'em
kept on paintin', ony jest Drusilly Potter, and she kept her
head out of the winder and talked to the old hoss Billy all
the time&mdash;she was a turrible hawbuck. The hoss he
knowd her voice and he begun a snortin' and ye never
heerd sich a consairnid rackit in yer born days. I was
dretful 'shamed, for the fellers must a thought strange on't;
but I didn't want to jaw her, for 'twouldn't a ben like
Amandy. The young men egzamined the paintin's and
admired them amazin'ly, and putty soon I hollered to the
little gearls to cum in, and 'twas ever so long afore they
obeydid the summonses. Finally they cum in, and says
I, "Ye may put on yer things, for I don't want to keep
these ere gentlemen waitin'." But the fellers said they
want in no hurry, and begged on me to continny my constructions&mdash;so
I heerd 'em spell, and then the fellers
wanted to hear 'em read; so I tell'd 'em to git their English
Readers, and they did. They read in the poitry in
the arternoon this time; I told 'em to read the peece beginnin',
"Dear Chole, while the boosy crowd"&mdash;'twas a
gret favoryte of mine, and I read it beautiful&mdash;I always
read a vairse fust for each on 'em, to show 'em how. The
gentlemen was inraptered with the readin'. Then I tell'd
'em to put on their things and make their monners&mdash;so
they did; and says I, "Siminary's out"&mdash;and they all
cleared out.</p>

<p>So I begun to git ready, and the fellers went down and
brung up the old surtoot.</p>

<p>"It don't rain," says I, "I han't no 'casion for that
are."</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"But," says Johnson, "it's damp, and we're afraid
ye'll ketch yer death a cold without it." So they put it
on, and they exorted me down stairs, and resisted me to
surmount the boss,&mdash;and there in the medder aside the
house was all my scholers a waitin' for to see me go.
Johnson he led the hoss, and Wilkins and Tomson walkt
on each side on't, and in that sittyation we went clean hum&mdash;and
ev'ry once in a while the hoss would stop still, and
Tomson, (tender-hearted young man,) instid of thumpin'
on him, would giv his tail a jerk and make him go agin.
All the gentlemen kept a payin' on me complements all the
way about my mojestic appearance&mdash;and ev'rybody stared
at us; but nobody couldent say a word&mdash;they was all
speechless with admireation. I must a persented an imposin'
appearence with the gret long surtoot a hangin' oyer
the hosses back, and my hair a floatin' over my sholders;
but I was quite oncomfortable, for 'twas dretful warm, and
the surtoot was dretful heavy, and the sun beet down
awful hot, so't my phiziogermy was all kivered with swetspiration.</p>

<p>Well, we got hum. I unmounted, and Johnson giv the
hoss a slap, and he limped off to Potter's. "Walk in,
gentlemen," says I. So they all cum in, and desisted me
off with the surtoot, and I opened the square room door,
and rushered 'em in. "Beseat yerselves," says I. Then
I went up chomber and arrannged my dress; wiped the
swetspiration off my face; done up my hair, it felt so
warm; stuck a couple of ostridge fethers in my head, and
condescended to the square room, where I found Aunt
Huldy and Mr. Jabez Spriggins, and his mother, an olderly
woman, of oncommon good understandin', and very
agreeable, but very nigh-sighted and considerble deef; so't

<!-- page 101 -->

she dident appear as much struck with my looks as she
otherways would a ben. She'd ben there all the arternoon,
and Jabez stopt on his way hum from school; they'd
ben a settin in the kitching long of Aunt Huldy.</p>

<p>"Yer sarvent," says Jabez, "I make ye acquaintid
with my mother."</p>

<p>"How do ye dew? "says I, but she dident look off her
nittin' work. So Jabez he hollered right in her ear,
"Miss Ruggles axes ye how ye dew?" "Miss Rugg?"
says she, "well, why couldent she speak up so's to be
heerd?" So I went and sot down nigh by her and
yelled out as loud as ever I could,</p>

<p>"Yer considerble hard of hearin', ain't ye Missis Spriggins?"
"Hard of hearin!" says she, "yer mistaken;
my hearin's as good as ever 'twas, ony I can't hear whisperin'
no more'n anybody else that hain't alwas ben used
to't; if they'd talk as they did when I was young I could
hear well enuff." Well, I talkt to Missis Spriggins a
spell, and she seemed to take quite a notion to me 'cause
I hollered so loud&mdash;said I talkt as they did in old times.
Byme by tea was reddy, and aunt cum in and called us
out&mdash;so we went into the kitching, and says aunt, "Set
by." So we sot down to the table, and we had punkin
pie, and apple-sass, and short cake, and nutcakes, and
sweet cake, and pickled cowcumbers, and sage cheeze.</p>

<p>"Missis Spriggins," says Aunt Huldy, "is yer tea
agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Yis," says she.</p>

<p>"Jabez is yourn?" "Fust rate," says he.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilkins, is yourn?" "Excellent," says he.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson is yourn?" "Delishus," says he.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tomson is yourn?"</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>"Exquizzite," says he.</p>

<p>"Well now," continyd she, "do eat, and don't be
bashful&mdash;do try to make out a supper:" and they all did
eat putty hearty but me&mdash;I ony took a dish of tea, and
dident eat nothin'.</p>

<p>Putty soon arter tea old Spriggins cum in a wagon arter
his wife. Aunt and uncle went in the kitching and I was
alone with four interestin' young men: so says I, "Gentlemen,
what good do ye spose it's a guayne to do ye to
take arter me? I'm undessoluhly united in the bonds of
affection on Philander; I can't incurridge nary on ye."
They all put their honkerchers to their eyes&mdash;Spriggins
he lookt dretfully pleased, and says he, "Ye don't mean
me tew, 'cause ye ain't a guayne to giv me my anser till
I've larnt that are you know what, and thattle be putty
soon, I tell ye."</p>

<p>"O!" says Wilkins says he, "don't put a momentarious
eend to all my hopes."</p>

<p>Says Tomson, "Don't break my heart by sayin' ye
won't be mine."</p>

<p>Says Johnson, "Don't, for goodness sake drive me to
desperation and discomboberation by sich soul-distractin'
words!"</p>

<p>"My gracious, Mr. Johnson," says I, "how much
that are speech of yourn did sound like Philander."</p>

<p>"Murder!" says he; "don't mention the name of that
detistable rival." Putty soon they all went, and if ever
there was three fellers felt bad, them are three collidge
fellers did.</p>

<p>Arter they'd went I went to take a walk, and I rombled
down to the lower eend of Uncle Jonah's farm&mdash;a morantic
and secludid spot, where there was a swamp with

<!-- page 103 -->

bushes all round it, and the air was impregginated with the
flagrance of thousands of lillies that growd there in gret
lugshuriance&mdash;and havin' my writin' consairns along I sot
down on a stump and convoked the aid of the musses as
follers:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>And gracious! I should be bereft<br/>

Of every consolation,<br/>

And sink right down beneath the heft<br/>

Of my sad sittyation.</p>

<p>Tho' troubled, I won't make no fuss<br/>

<p>OLD SONG.</p>

</div>

<p>WELL, the anteceedin' week of things went on
purty much as they did the proceedin'; but a
Saturday an event conspired that channged my
destination. When I went hum from my siminary,
lo and behold, there was a letter from Podunk for
me; and I opened it and found 'twas from father&mdash;here's
a subscription on't:</p>

<p>"DORTER MILLY:&mdash;Cum hum right strait off you&mdash;yer
marm is to the pint of death. She was took last week with
a dretful cramp in her side&mdash;awful crick in her back&mdash;blind
headache and tumble cold feet. She's talkt about her
Milly ever sen she was took, and wanted to have us send
for ye at fust, but as I reckoned she'd git up agin afore
long&mdash;(cause she's ben took so a number of times and
never died afore)&mdash;I thought 'twant best to send for ye,
we've had sich peecable times sen ye went off; but she got
wus and wus, and now we don't have no idee she'll git
well&mdash;so ye jest cum hum as quick as ye can, and dew
make up yer mind to be of sum sarvice to us when ye git
here.<br/>
Yer daddy,<br/>
"NADAB RUGGLES."</p>

<!-- page 105 -->

<p>Now, thinks me, my exhibition's all knockt in the head&mdash;(for
yer must know I was perjectin to have an exhibition
in my siminary)&mdash;and I mustent think of nothin' now
only my beloved payrent&mdash;so I huv myself on the bed
and jackelated, "O mairciful creation! support and
strenken me in this try in hour, and enable me to cumfort
my onfortinate mother afore she dies." Jest as Amandy
did when she heard of her father's illness. Then I thought
Ide go into highsterics. So I begun kickin' and squallin'
and rollin' my eyes consairnedly. Aunt Huldy she heerd
me and she cum up.</p>

<p>"Grandfer grievous!" says she, "what's to pay?"</p>

<p>"O dear suz!" says I, "read that are letter and ye
won't wonder at me&mdash;for my everlastin' dear mother isent
suspected to live from one day to t'other."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," says she. So she took and read
it, and says she, "Ile go hum with ye, for I must see
Viny once more afore she dies; jump up, Milly; we'll git
reddy right off; and go in the stage when it cums along
this evenin'."</p>

<p>"Onfeelin' woman!" says I, "how can ye tell me to
git up when I've got the highstericks so owfully!"</p>

<p>"I know it," says she, "poor child! but then if ye
don't git over it the stage will go along afore yer reddy&mdash;and
don't ye remember how Amandy hurried to git to her
father when she heerd he was sick." So I hopt up in the
most agonizin' state of condition and begun to git reddy.
I put on my black rottenette gownd, and a black bombazeen
long shawl that mother gin me, one she wore when
she was in mournin' for Grandfer Hogobone&mdash;then I tied
a black ribbin round my bunnit, and stuck one amazin'
long black ostridge fether in't. Then I stufft all the rest

<!-- page 106 -->

of my things in my chist and lockt it up. Whilst I was
fixin', Aunt Huldy went out and told Uncle Jonah, and
purty soon they cum in, and says uncle, says he,</p>

<p>"Why, Milly, it's all nonsense for yer aunt to go hum
with ye."</p>

<p>"I guess Ile go for all you&mdash;so there now," says aunt.</p>

<p>"Well," says uncle, "I shant giv ye no money to go
with. Ye never hear of any of yer relations bein' sick
but what ye want to go and see 'em die, and cut a sworth
to the funeral, and ye might better stay hum and take care
of yer family."</p>

<p>"Mighty family!" says Aunt Huldy, "ony one old
coot to see tew!"</p>

<p>"Mister and Missis," says I, "if ye want to qurril on
this mawlaneolly casion I wish ye'd retire to the kitchenary
department, and not disturb me by yer discongenial exploteration."
So they went off, and I sot down and writ
the follerin' notice to my school:</p>

<p>"DARLIN PUPPILS:&mdash;It is with the biggest sorrer I
denounce to you that I shall be onable to construct you
enny more at present; and whether I shall ever consume
the delightful task to develup yer minds enny more is a
circumstence that lies hid in the unbeholden debths of
futrinity. I am summonsed to contend the death-bed of an
only and beloved mother&mdash;but I wish to desire to make
one last request of ye. I want ye all to go to meetin' to-morrer
drest in black gownds and black ostridge fethers in
yer bonnits, and when meetin's out, perceed to the front
of Deacon Peabody's door&mdash;rannge yerselves in a row
and sing the follerin' stanzy to the tune of the long meetre
doxyology:</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p class="small">"Alas! our dar-lin' teacher's gone,<br/>

That's why we put these black gownds on;<br/>

We can't submit to't tho' we must;<br/>

It seems as if our very hearts would bust."</p>

<p>Arter supper the stage cum along, and Uncle Jonah run
out and hulloed, "Passenger for Podunk;" so they druv
up, and we all went out, and whilst the driver was helpin'
Uncle Jonah put my chist into't, I huv my arms round
Aunt Huldy and kist her agin and agin, exclamigatin',
"Farewell belovedest, darlinest Aunt Huldy&mdash;may all
the blessins of Heaven be condescended upon yer." Then
I stretcht out one hand and had t'other on my heart, and
lookin' round me with a heavy sythe, says I thus: "Adoo!
sylvanic shades of Higgins Patent! no longer will ye giv
a sylum to the fair Permilly. Adoo! sweet umbraggious
shady grove where I parted with Philander&mdash;no more will
my fairy form wander amonkst yer excludid shades, to
court the musses and think on my distant swine&mdash;I bid
ye an unterminable farewell!"</p>

<p>There was three gentlemen in the stage, and they stared
at me consairnedly, and says one on 'em to Aunt Huldy,
"Is the young woman derannged?"</p>

<p>"Derannged! no;" says she, "ony she's ruther
smarter'n common folks."</p>

<p>Well, I got in and we druv off. O! if there is a
minnit in this subernary state of egsistence, when the sad
and sorrerful sperrit fells as if it wouldent giv teppence
for all creation, 'tis when we part with frinds. I felt so
then&mdash;so I huv my head languidiously over onto the
sholder of the man that sot aside of me, and bust into a
simmultaneous flood of tears.</p>

<p>After Ide recovered a little I raised my droopin' head

<!-- page 108 -->

and lookt round and I never see tew surprisder lookin'
creeturs than the men that sot opposit of me. They
opened their eyes as big as sarcers and begun whisperin'
about me&mdash;but the one next to me dident say a word. So
I lookt round at him and good gracious! he lookt so much
like Philander (ony sum older,) that I utterated a percin'
skreik and tumbled prostracious on the bottom of the
stage. They all jumpt up and resisted me to rise and arter
I was beseated, says I, "Gentlemen, mabby you think
strannge of me, and for fear you should intertain oranious
impressions regardin' me, Ile tell ye my history, if ye'd
like to hear it." They all said they'd like to hear it wonderfully&mdash;so
I telld 'em the hull I've telld my readers; only
I couldent remember all the poitry; but I had a coppy of
my Ode to Memory in my work pocket, and I took that
out and read it to 'em. The young man that set aside of
me said he never heerd enny thing equal to it; but the
other men dident say a word, and nary on 'em dident speak
to me agin&mdash;they was olderly men and oncommon ruff
lookin', but 'tother one was a rael slick lookin' feller&mdash;he
telld me he lived in Utica; and like most of the residers
of that extensyve and anncient city he was oncommon ginteel
in his appearance, and refined in his monners. Well,
purty soon we arrove at Utica, and the stage druv up to
the stage-house, and there was a lot of men standin' round,
and when the young man got out, there was one run out
amonkst from 'em and shook hands with him; so I poked
my head out to git a better sight on him, and as true as creation,
'twas Philander! my long-lost Philander. He was
considerble altered, and I should a thought 'twas Johnson
if he hadent a had on the same green coat with a black
velvet collar he had on when he paid his distresses to me;

<!-- page 109 -->

but there was no mistake; so I jumpt out of the stage and
run towerds him. The men all gin way for me and I rushed
ahead exclamigatin, "O Philander! my own darlin' Philander!
Heaven has at last restorated you to your mournin'
but faithful Permilly."</p>

<p>So sayin' I huv my arms round him and eeny most had
a highsteric fit. There was ever so many young men
standin' round, and amongst 'em I see Wilkins and Tomson,
and they all hoorawd. Philander, instid of returnin'
my inraptured caresses, lookt rael mad, and dident know
what to do. At last the young man that cum in the stage
with me says he, "The young woman's crazy&mdash;she's
taken my brother to be sumbody else;" and says Philander,
"We'd better take her into the house till the stage is
reddy." So he and his brother led me in and sot me down
on a sofy, and all the other fellers follered arter. Philander
and his brother whispered together a spell, and then
Philander went out, motionin' to t'other fellers to accompanate
him. Arter they'd all went ony Philander's brother
and me, he cum to me and says he, "Miss Euggles;"
says I, "Hay!" says he, "I've got suthin to tell ye.
thattle no doubt make ye feel ruther bad, and tho' I'd
ruther have an iron spike druv thro' me than to communicate
sich a piece of contelligence, yit it's my duty to do it,
and if I don't ye'll find it out sum time or other."</p>

<p>"Dew tell," says I, "my curiosity is rung up to the
biggest pitch&mdash;dew tell me."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "if I must I must&mdash;Philander's
married!"</p>

<p>If a thousand muskits had ben fired at my head, and a
million baggernets run through my body, I shouldent a ben
more bethunderstruck nor no nigher killed than I was that

<!-- page 110 -->

minnit. I yelled out as loud as ever I could, and then I
got up and took off my bunnit and laid it on the table, and
begun tearin' my hair most awfully, and ravin' and
screemin; the wost way, so't all the folks in the house cum
runnin' in to see what was the matter. Arter Ide got
complectly desausted I sot down and gin vent to my sorrer
in heart-splittin' groans and sythes, and thinks me, how
would Amandy acted if she'd heern Lord Mortimer was
married? There's no tellin'. But I know how she acted
when she heerd he was a guayne to be. She lost her
appertite and growd as thin as a rail; but dident say a
word about it to nobody&mdash;tho' she took on when she got
alone. And thinks me, like enuff Philander's torrannical
father has ben a makin' of him git married agin his inclination,
jest as Lord Mortimer's father was a guayne to make
him. So says I, "Did his cruel father impel him to git
married agin his inclination?" and I lookt round to where
Philander's brother sot, and lo and behold, he want there.
I spose he was so overcum by my sufferins he couldent
stand it, and so cleard out, and I never see no more on
him nor Philander nyther from that day to this. I han't
no doubt but what Philander had been conduced to believe
that I was onfaithful to him. Lord Mortimer wouldent a
wiped his old shoes on Lady Euphrasia Sutherland if he
hadent a sposed Amandy was onfaithful&mdash;no more wouldent
Philander a married anybody else if he hadn't a sposed
Ide forgit him, and Ide be wiling to bet a hoss that Johnson
and Wilkins and Tomson had been a lyin' to him about
me; 'cause they wanted me themselves. Well, arter
thinkin' on't all over I got up and dun up my hair, and put
on my bunnit, and tho' there was more'n forty folks&mdash;men,
wimmin, and children, axin' of me questions&mdash;I dident

<!-- page 111 -->

anser 'em nor tell 'em what ailded me, but arter Ide got
fixt I went out and stood by the door till t'other stage got
reddy to go, and then I got in and huv my head agin the
back side of the stage and shot up my eyes and dident
open 'em agin whilst t'other passengers was a gittin' in,
nor for quite a spell arterwards: but there I sot a ponderin',
and my rumirations was the most distressin' I ever
experienced in my born days, and whilst I was a settin' in
that persition I composed sum very mournful stanzys, and
I thought Ide write 'em off so I opend my eyes and I see
'twas considerble dark, so't I couldent see the folks that
was in the stage, ony so fur as to see that they was all
men folks, and I was the ony shemale in the stage. So
says I, "Gentlemen, I want to write down sum poitry
and I don't see how Ime to do it, it's so dark."</p>

<p>"O!" says one on 'em says he, "I can write as well
in the dark as I can without a light. Ile write it for ye if
ye'll tell me as I go long."</p>

<p>"Ile be obleejed to ye to do it," says I: so I gin him
my pencil and a piece of paper, and he took his hat and
writ on top on't, (me tellin' on him a line to once) the
follerin':</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">ON A LAMENT.</p>

<p>Did you ever see Philander?<br/>

O! he was a charmin' swine;<br/>

<p>To a maid he took a notion,<br/>

<p>"That's all," says I, "now giv it to me."</p>

<p>"O no!" says he, "you must allow me to read it to
my frinds&mdash;it's exquizzite." As soon as he said that I
know'd who 'twas: "Land of liberty!" says I, "Mr.
Tomson, is that you?"</p>

<p>"Egzackly," says he, "and I vow I believe this is

<p>"By George!" says Wilkins, "we're a fortinate set
of fellers to be so onexpectedly favored with Miss Ruggleses
company."</p>

<p>"Hold yer jaw," says I, "yer a mean, contemptible
set of villings; I won't have nothin' to say to nary one on

<p>"This is strannge," says Johnson, "how on airth have
we offended you?"</p>

<p>"Purty question for you to ax, you tarnal wretch," says
I, shaking my fist in his face.</p>

<p>"What have we done?" says Tomson.</p>

<p>"Dun?" says I. "Haint ye ben the means of dashin'
the dish of felickity from my lips?&mdash;Haint ye underminded
me in the affections of Philander? Haint it ben thro'
your instrumentality that he's went and married another,
and left me to uncomboundid dispare?"</p>

<p>"O yer mistaken!" says they all to once.</p>

<p>"I aint nyther," says I&mdash;so I stuft my fingers in my
ears and held 'em so ever so long. At last Tomson
begun to read the poitry he'd writ down for me out loud,
and when he'd red it they sung it to a Methodist tune.

<!-- page 113 -->

Tomson he lined it as they do in meetin'. So I took my
fingers out of my ears to listen to 'em, and says Johnson,
"Music hath charms to sooth a savidge! I tho't you'd get
over it."</p>

<p>"I hain't got over it nyther," says I&mdash;so I stuck my
head out of the winder and hollerd "Murder! murder!"
as loud as ever I could yell. Well the hosses they was
dretfully skairt, and took off as tight as ever they could
pull. The driver he tried to hold 'em in, and kept a
hollerin' "hoe!" but they went faster and faster, and
purty soon they went tearin' down a hill and huv the
stage right over; and we all cum tumblin' out <i>en massy</i>&mdash;but
this ere's an oncommon long chopter, so I must cum
to an eend just where I shouldent orto.</p>

<p>"Hold yer jaw," says I, "yer a set of thunderin' mean
scampers, I won't be seen in yer company&mdash;I despise ye
more'n I dew the airth I tred on&mdash;I don't consider ye
worth turnin' my nose up at."</p>

<p>"Well," says the driver, "if ye did ye wouldent have
to do it, seein' it's alreddy arrannged in that persition."
When the driver said that, the fellers all lafft consairnedly.</p>

<p>"O, lawful suz!" says I, "ye all begin to laff now
seein' ye can't git me. Jabez Spriggins telld the truth
about ye when he said ye tho't ye'd lairnt all there was to
be lairnt to Hamilton Collidge and so sot off for Durrup
Collidge to use that up tew; but I can tell ye if ye go to
all the Collidges in Americy, ye won't know B from
broomstick&mdash;so Mister Perliteness" (continuyd I, addressin'
the driver), "jest take off my chist, for Ime a
guayne to stop to this ere house. "Yer chist," says he,
"ye han't no chist." So says I to the man, "Mister, I
wish ye'd let yer boy there go up to Utica and get my
chist&mdash;they forgot to put it aboard the stage." But the
driver up and says he, "Don't ye dew it; she han't got no
chist; she's crazy."</p>

<p>"Ye lie like split," says I, "I'm a young woman of
the biggest respecterbility&mdash;of Dutch distraction on the
mother's side, and New England consent on the father's,
and my Grandfer Ruggles fit, bled, and died in the revolutionerry
tussle, and arterwards drawd a pension, and if

<!-- page 115 -->

it want for all these ere sircumstences my own individdyal
extinction would be enuff to skewer me the steam and admireation
of all creation."</p>

<p>"Well," says the driver, "ye've got to pay as much
dammage as if ye went to Durrup." So I took out my
puss and paid him and they druv off and I went into the
house: and says I to the man and woman, "That are
driver haint no reason to think I'm derannged, ony cause
I wouldent travil with the company he's carryin', and I do
boseech on ye to send arter my chist to Utica, for it's got
all my notions in't."</p>

<p>"Well," says the man, "it's pitch dark now&mdash;I can't
let Hoky go to-night, but mabby I will to-morrer."</p>

<p>"Well, then," says I, "jest give giv me a compartment
for I want to go into a state of retiracy."</p>

<p>"Give ye what?" says the woman.</p>

<p>"Why, a room to sleep in you," says I.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "ye'll have to sleep with Zady, for
the schoolmaster's a boardin' here this week, and he's got
the spare bed, and he's gone to bed now." So she took a
lontern and went up chomber and I follered arter, and she
rushered me into a room that was in considerable of a
condition&mdash;there was a half a lookin glass, an old three
legged cheer, and an old shakin' table that would tumble
over if ye lookt at it hard; and in the corner was a trundle
bed and a gret fat gearl asleep on't a snorin' the wost
way.</p>

<p>"Good woman," says I. "My name's Missis Hitchins,"
says she.</p>

<p>"Well, Missis Hitchins," says I, "ye may make yer
disappearance." So she went off, and I took the lontern
and went up and took a realizin' sense of the trundle bed;

<!-- page 116 -->

and besides the snorin' of the fleshy gearl, the oncommon
narrowness of the trundle bed was sich as to render it onpossible
to repoze there: so thinks me, I'll set up all night.
So I turned the old cheer over and sot down on't, and begun
to ponderate; and thinks me, how much my sittyation
is like Amandy's when she stopt to old Byrnes flambergasted
cottidge. What a pity she dident have my genyus
for makin' poitry&mdash;what an interestin' account she'd a gin
of her misfortins; but taint everybody that has a natral
genyus for't, and if it don't cum natral there's no use in
tryin'&mdash;they mought as well try to make a univairse as
to try to make poitry without beein' natrally gifted that
way&mdash;and seein' I've got sich gret poeticle tallents Ide
or'to improve 'em, and certainly the sollein sittyation Ime
placed in to-night should or'to inspire me with a wonderful
frenzy for composin'. So I lookt in my ridicule and
there want no paper there.</p>

<p>Just then I heerd sumbody in the contigruous room utterate
the terriblest percin' skreek I ever heerd in my born
days. So thinks me, sumbody's dyin' or sumbody's murderin'
sumbody; and bein' indued with oncommon curridge,
I ketcht the lontern and run in there&mdash;but there
want no noise nor nobody there ony sumbody in bed; so I
went up to the bed to see whether the occerpyer was dead
or alive&mdash;and lo and behold, there was a very interestin'
lookin' young man asleep there, and thinks me he had the
nightmare when he yelled so&mdash;no doubt he was a dreamin'
of his own sorrers and misfortins, for I knowd from his
looks that he want a strannger to greef. He had on a red
nightcap with a tossil on top, and a number of holes in't
thro' which his dark hair was pokin' in greaceful neglitude.
O! (solliquized I,) greef has did its work on that are

<!-- page 117 -->

long thin nose and turned up the tip on't with continyl
sobbin'! greef has undoubtedly drawd down the corners
of that are mouth, and dreams of unrelentin' ennemys
pursuin' of ye has certinly skairt ye to sich an alarming
degree as to make yer ears start out so and bust them
holes in yer nightcap! peace to yer ashes, mournin' swine.
So sayin' I turned round to go out, when I obsairved sum
paper lyin' on the table. So I reckoned Ide help myself
to a sheet on't to write sum poitry on; but seein' an ink-stand
and pen there thinks me, Ile write here cause this
ere table don't shake so as t'other does. So I drawd up a
cheer and sot down, and my medifications resulted in the
follerin' confusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Who knows but what I'm settin' nigh<br/>

<p>Mabby his father was onkind,<br/>

And tried to make him wed<br/>

And so from hum he fled.</p>

<p>Tho' others blame ye, mournin' man,<br/>

I'm sure 'twould raise yer dander,<br/>

For now I mourn the onfaithfulness<br/>

Dear broken-hearted creetur,<br/>

'Tis Milly Ruggles, writes these lines,<br/>

When mornin' cums ye'll meet her.</p>

</div>

<p>When Ide writ this affectin' poem, I laid it in Pike's
Rithmetick I see lyin' there; then I turned to take one
more look of the young man abed&mdash;and whether or no
the lontern shinin' in his eyes woke him up or not I don't
know; enny how he opened his eyes and lookt up at me;
arter starin' at me a spell with the biggest wonderation
depictered on his phizziogermy, says he to me, says he,
"Jimmini! who in the name of wonder be you?"</p>

<p>"Don't ax who I be," says I, "jest look in Pike's
rithmetick and thattle giv ye the <i>denowment</i> who I be."</p>

<p>"Pike's Rithmetic," says he, "I know a man about my
size that can find out eeny most ennything by studdyin'
out on't&mdash;but by gum! I don't see how Ime to find who
you be if I cipher out on't from now to next never."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "you look right next the kiver and
you'll see." So sayin' I made a curchy and vanished into
t'other room leavin' my lontern behind.</p>

<p>Arter I went out I listend to the door and heerd him
git up and go to the table and read the confusion out loud.</p>

<p>Arter he'd read it, says he, "Jimmini!" a number of
times&mdash;then I heerd him a mendin' a pen&mdash;and then he
begun to write and writ for ever so long. At last I got
tired listenin', so I tho't Ide set down agin; but as I went
to beseat myself I got on the wrong eend of the cheer&mdash;(ye

<!-- page 119 -->

know 'twas turned down)&mdash;and it let me right onto
the floor, and it made sieh a rackit it woke up Zady, and
she hollerd out, "Grandfer Griffin! what in natur's to
pay?" I never said a word. "Arter all," solliquized
she, "mabby 'twan't nothin' but me dreamin'." So sayin'
she gin two or three grunts and turned over and went to
sleep agin. So I got up, fixt the cheer, and sot down
strait, laid my head on the table and went to sleep, and
dident wake up agin till mornin'; and then my neck was
so stiff holdin' on't so long in that betwistid persition that
I couldent scerce move it for ever so long. As soon as it
got limberd a little I riz and arrannged my dress and went
down stairs, leavin' Zady sound asleep. The man and
woman was up, and arter a spell Zady got up and cum
thumpin' down. I was settin' behind the door so she dident
see me, and she took tew pails and went off to milkin',
and the woman begun to get breckfust, and says she,
"Young woman, ye'll have to be sairved as the rest on
us be&mdash;for the master's got to have the silver spoon
and the chany teacup and sarcer."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't ker," says I, "Amandy had to drink
ut of a noggin to old Byrnes."</p>

<p>"Who had tew?" says she.</p>

<p>"Amandy Fitzalan," says I.</p>

<p>"Sumbody I don't know," says she.</p>

<p>Then she went out to pull sum inyons, and whilst she
was gone the master cum down&mdash;he dident see me&mdash;so
I kehawked and he lookt round.</p>

<p>"Good mornin', Miss Ruggles," says he, makin' a
scrapin' bow.</p>

<p>"Good mornin' to yer lordship," says I, curchyin'.</p>

<p>Says he, "I feel extrornary honored by the visit ye

<!-- page 120 -->

made me last night&mdash;and that poitry! Jimmini, it's fine!
I couldent rest till Ide writ an anser to it&mdash;for Ime a poit
of considerble merrit myself&mdash;I've had a number of articles
printed in that are well-conductid perryodical, the
Mohawk Meteor and Marcy Republican. You've ondoubtidly
seen and admired the poetical countributions
signed 'The Mudbow Minstrel;' them's mine. I'm no
strannger to yer repitation, Miss Ruggles, for Ime an intimit
frind of young Spriggins&mdash;a gret admirer of yourn&mdash;and
he and I corrisponds; his pistles is full of your
praises, so that my curiosity to behold ye had arriven to a
wonderful pitch, but Ide no idee of it's bein gratifacted in
the interestin' monner it was by yer morantic visitation
last night."</p>

<p>"But," says I, interruptin' him, "ye said how't ye
writ an anser to my poim. I should like to see it."</p>

<p>So he put his hand in his pockit and took out a foldid
paper containin' 45 amazin' putty vairses, and tho' it
would take tew much time to coppy 'em all, I can't help
substractin' a few on 'em. Arter guayne on to say how't
he want asleep when I went into his room, but ony "pertendin'
for to sleep," he continnys in the follerin monner:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"O! sich a face I never see<br/>

Sence I on airth was born!<br/>

'Twas brightest noonday's sun to me,<br/>

With blushing hues of morn.</p>

<p>"And then I seen you starin' round,<br/>

Jest like sum creetur's ghost,<br/>

That cum to find, from under ground,<br/>

Sumthin' it had lost.</p>

<p>"And then my pen I seen you take,<br/>

My paper, ink, and cheer,<br/>

<!-- page 121 -->

And then set down all for to make<br/>

That poitry so dear.</p>

<p>"And o'er the sheet the pen you drew,<br/>

In rhyming fury dashing,<br/>

And from yer eyes the idees flew,<br/>

Like lightning bugs a flashing."</p>

</div>

<p>Here comes in a number of stanzys about Mister
Shakespeare, rollin' frenzy, &amp;c.; and then he goes on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"And when you'd got it writ, you took<br/>

And put it in my Pike&mdash;<br/>

That jewel of a ciphering book&mdash;<br/>

You must a knowd I like.</p>

<p>"By day I read that rithmetick,<br/>

It occerpies my slumbers,<br/>

'Twas there I learnt to rhyme so slick,<br/>

And got so skilled in numbers.</p>

<p>"My streekid sky's ben black and blue,<br/>

A world of botheration,<br/>

As you have ben, so I've ben through<br/>

A sight of tribulation."</p>

</div>

<p>Then he goes on to tell about his sorrers&mdash;how't he'd
ben in love a number of times and always got the mitten,
and so finally made up his mind not to try no more&mdash;
but taint woth while to subscribe that part, as there's 18
vairses on't. So he continys,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Ah! Shakespeare says,&mdash;"</p>

<p>(I spose this Mr. Shakespeare's sum intimit frind of
hissen.)</p>

<p class="small">"Ah! Shakespeare says, and Shakespeare knew,<br/>

(To you and me that's plain)&mdash;<br/>

That true love never did run true,<br/>

But always cross the grain."</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p>Then he goes on through a number of stanzys to discribe
the oncerting natur of love&mdash;the coldness of the
world in gineral, and the shemale sect in perticler&mdash;the
trials that genyus has to undergo&mdash;and at last eends as
fellers,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Now sence in rhyme my woes and struggles<br/>

Ive had a chance to pour 'em,<br/>

Ile jest subscribe myself, Miss Ruggles,<br/>

Your friend, P. ZEBIDEE GORUM."</p>

<p>I dident read all the poitry then; I put it in my ridicule,
and arter thankin' the master for't, says I, "I hope
ye won't tell these folks about my guayne inter yer chomber
last night; cause if ye dew they'll think the driver
telld the truth when he said I was crazy."</p>

<p>"O! I won't mention it," says he, "but how on airth
did you git here?"</p>

<p>I was jest a guayne to conform him, when Missis
Hitchins and Zady and the old man cum in. Zady was
bethunderstruck to see me, and they was all supprized
enuff when the master introducted me to 'em. Arter that
they was amazin' perlite. Well, we sot down to breckfust&mdash;but
I must resairve whot concurred that day ('twas
Sabberday ye know) for another chopter.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<div class="center">

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>O! Sangerfield!<br/>

At every one,<br/>

And fires away their breath!"</p>

<p>SANGERFIELD HUDDLE BARD.</p>

</div>

<p>ARTER breekfust I axed Mr. Hitchins if Hoky mut
go arter my chist, and he said seein' 'twas me and
seein' 'twas a case of necesserty he mought, tho'
'twas agin his principles to ride anywhere a Sabberday
ony to meetin'. So Hoky he put on his Sundy
clus, and tallerd his hair, and harnissed the hosses to the
waggin and sot off for Utica, and he cum hum in about
tew hours. Missis Hitchins axed me to go to meetin' with
'em&mdash;(they attendid dervine sairvice to New Hartford,
about a mild from there,) but I telld her Ide ruther wait
till arternoon, cause my chist hadent arrove yit.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "we shant be hum a noontime, so
how'll ye find the way to meetin'?"</p>

<p>"O!" says Mr. P. Zebidee Gorum, "Ile stay till
arternoon and so go with Miss Ruggles."</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "if ye want anything to eat ye'll
find a platter of nutcakes in the cubberd, and sum cheese
on the buttry shelf."</p>

<p>So she and Mr. Hitchins and Zady sot off for meetin',

<!-- page 124 -->

and I and the master was left alone together, and we convairsed
about things in gineral, and I discovered that Mr.
Gorum was a young man of uncommon bright immaginnation
and highly cultivated mind. I axed him to write
me an ode on the death of my mother.</p>

<p>"Is yer mother dead?" says he.</p>

<p>"No," says I, "but I suspect she will be by the time
I get hum." So sayin' I put my honkercher to my eyes,
and was dretfully overcum for a spell.</p>

<p>Bymeby Hoky arrove with my chist, and as I was a
guayne out in the stage that evenin' I reckond I wouldent
have it carried up chomber. So I took out my kee and
onlocked it, and took out sich articles as I contendid to
put on, and went up into Zady's room and arrannged my
apparril.</p>

<p>Beein' a very warm day I tho't I wouldn't wear no bunnit
to meetin'. So I done up my auburn tressis with my
high-toppt comb, tied my six black ostridge fethers together
with a black ribbin and stuck 'em in my head&mdash;ye know
I had on my black rottenette gownd&mdash;well, I rolled up
the sleeves to make 'em look short, and put on my long
black cambrick gloves, then I huv my black long shawl
round my neck and pined it down on one sholder with a
black bow with tew eends to't much as a yard and a half
long, then I loopt the skeart of my gownd up on one side
and pined a black bow on't, and my dress was completed,
and certingly if ever a creetur lookt interestin' I did that
minnit in my mournin' habileations.</p>

<p>Arter I was drest I condesendid, and I never see a surprisder
creetur than the master was&mdash;he was quite overcum
with admireation, and declared that he never see a
more charmin' appeerance than what I persented all in

<!-- page 125 -->

black. Well he went into the buttry and brung me a
piece of cheese on a fork, and then he went to the cubberd
and fetched me a wonderful long nutcake on another fork.
Then he helpt himself and arter we'd eat 'em he said 'twas
time to be guayne. So I took my parry sol and we lockt
arms and off we sot for meetin, and I don't bleeve that
tew more interestin' beeins ever prerambleated the scruburbs
of New Hartford afore or sen. Mr. Gorum was
drest with the biggest taste; he had on a long-tailed yaller
thin coat and nankeen trowsis. Well, we walkt purty
slow and when we got to meetin' the folks had most on
'em arrove there, and as he walkt up the broad ile the people
stared at us as if they was bethunderstruck. The minister
was a read in' the sam and he stoppt as much as a
minnit; but Missis Hitchins and Zady was surprisder than
anybody else. I never extracted so much attention in my
life as I did that day in the New Hartford presbiteerian
meetin' house&mdash;once in the sairmon the minister illuded to
the sorrers and disappintments of airth, and I groaned out
loud, and everybody lookt round at me, and sum onfeelin
folks lafft; then the minister he lookt awful mad, and
stoppin' right short in his dizcourse, says he, "My frinds,
the sanctooerry aint no place to be merry." So they
stoppt laffin, and the men folks ginerally stoppt starin',
but the wimmin folks couldent help peekin' round once in
a while.</p>

<p>Bymeby meetin' was out and we went hum, and arter
tea I arrannged my dress for travelling and about six
o'clock the stage cum along. I axed Mr. Hitchins what
was the dammidge, but he wouldent take nothin'. So I
thanked him and then I had a very affectionit partin' with
Mr. Gorum, (he was ividently took with me) and then I

<!-- page 126 -->

got into the stage and startid for Podunk. There was five
men folks in the stage; all on 'em oncommon ruffins but
one, and he was sich an attracktyve man I can't help describin'
on him; he had a very dignified but summat
stairrin' phizziogermy&mdash;tho' when he addrested himself to
me a brand smile played over his feeters&mdash;but I never see
the beat of his conversationable powers afore nor sen. The
other passengers was electrificated by his eloquation, and
dident say but very little, and no wonder! He was talkin'
about Utica when I got in, and it was ivident that he was
a resider of that citty.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," says he, "our citty is the sentre of the
State&mdash;I may say of the United States. It is as remarkerble
for its intairnal arranngements as it is for the
inlightenment and infermation of its inhabiters. It is
in all respects very fur previous to Phelidelphy. New York
itself can't hold a candle to it. Gentlemen! where will
ye find such refinement of monners and eleguance of appeerence
as the ladies of our city pozzess? and where sich
intellectitude of mind&mdash;sich profoundly of tallents&mdash;sich
overwhelming and captivatin' abillyties as our men of
sighence egsibit? our young men partickleary&mdash;I may
safely say they are previous to any other young men in
the United States, and subzequentto nun in the univairse."
Then turning to me with a ravishin' smile, says he, "Mum,
have ye ever been in Utica, mum?"</p>

<p>"Yis," says T, syin' "I was there yisterday under
very distressin' circumstences."</p>

<p>"Ah!" says he, with a very greaceful inclineation of
his boddy, "may I enquire what distressin' ok-kurrence
ok-kurred?" So I recountered the hull of my history
from beginnin' to eend, and when Ide finnishid, says he,
with another greaceful inclineation,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"It seems to me, mum, you've ben the artifisher of yer
own misfortins by givin' way to the sensibilitude with
which you are indewed by natur'&mdash;the egshuberance of
your immaggination and vivacitude of your sperrits has intirely
outstript your discretionery powers, mum."</p>

<p>Jest then we cum to Little Falls, and the four codgers
got out and a remarkerble ginteel woman and a little boy
about five year old got in. It was considerble dark and I
couldent see her feeters extinctly, but putty soon she spoke
to the little boy, and I recognatid her voice in a minnit.</p>

<p>"Goody gracious, Miss Van Dusen!" says I.</p>

<p>"Mairciful heavens! my dear Permiliy!" says she&mdash;and
we huv ourselves into one another's arms.</p>

<p>O! if there is a minnit when the heart-broken sperrit
feels as if it would go off the handle with joy, 'tis when long
severatid frinds onexpectedly meets! For a spell we
strainded one another in a silent imbrace without utteratin'
a sillybull ony jackilation&mdash;"O! Miss Yan Dusen!"
"O! Permilly!"&mdash;at which Mr. Spluttergut, the gentleman
from Utica, seemed much affectid. When we was
recoveratid from our jouful supprise I axed her where she
was guayne, and she conformed me that she was a guayne
to visit her relatyves in Durrup, and that she had ben
married a number of year to Squire Stokes, one of the fust
men in Little Falls.</p>

<p>"Do tell!" says I, "and is this ere sweet little cherubim
yer son?"</p>

<p>"Yis," anserd she, "my on'y son."</p>

<p>"What's yer name, you little darlin'?" says I, kissin'
of him&mdash;but instid of anserin' he begun to beller, and his
mother said he was dretful sensatyve; always cry'd when
stranngers spoke to him&mdash;"his name's Lord Mortimer,"

<!-- page 128 -->

continyd she, "I wantid to giv him a cognomer that wo'd
sound well in congriss&mdash;I intend he shall write it 'L.
Mortimer Stokes.' "</p>

<p>"Charmin' name," says I. Then she axed me where I
was guayne? And I begun to the beginnin' of my history
arter I left her siminary and tell'd her the hull, and she
was very much affectid.</p>

<p>"O!" says she, "I knowd that yer sensatyve and morantic
nater would have to suffer wonderfully from the cold
onfeelin' world." Then she went on advisin' of me to recipperate
Jabezes affection, sayin' that a heart like hisen
was woth possessing and more'n all that 'twas time I was
settled down.</p>

<p>Well, bime-by we arrove to Durrup, (or Skenackedy,
as sum calls it,) and Missis Stokes invitid me to accompanate
her to her father-in-law's and beein' eeny most tired
out, for we'de rid all night, I thought I would. So we
got out and I axed Mr. Spluttergut to call on me if ever
he cum our wav, and he wantid to be conformed where I
resided; and I tell'd him in the villidge of Podunk. "Ah,
egzactly," says he, with a greaceful inclineation, "I remember
the loquation very well now&mdash;it's a short distance
previous to Schaticoke."</p>

<p>"Jest so," says I. So then we sepperatid, and I never
see a bow that was a sircumstence to the one he made at
our partin'.</p>

<p>Then my former instructoress and me winded our way
to Mr. Stokesis, and the old folks was wonderful glad to
see Silly, as they called her, (her name was Prisilly naterally,)
and I raly tho't they'd eat up little Lord Mortimer,
and they was very perlite to me tew, and said that if Ide
stay till arter dinner they'de send me hum in their waggin,

<!-- page 129 -->

and so I concludid I would, "tho' ev'ry minnit," jackilatid
I, "that restrains me from my adored mother seems like
an etarnity of a hundred year." Well, we had dinner, and
then Philo Stokes&mdash;the old folksis youngest son&mdash;got
the waggin reddy, and arter tellin' the Stokesis to cum to
Podunk, Missis Silly Stokes perticklearly, and imbracin'
her tenderly, I and my chist, and Philo set off for Podunk.
We got there about 4 o'clock, and as we was a drivin' into
the villidge, I cryin' and ringin' my hands distractiously,
we met Mr. Smith, the onfeelin' postmaster, and says
he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No wonder ye cry; ye've ben the means of yer poor
mother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ben the means on her," says I.</p>

<p>"Yis," anserd he, "Missis Smith says she haint a
doubt but what 'twas takin' on about you sot her into the
dizorder she died on&mdash;she was berried yesterday."</p>

<p>When he said that I sunk faintin' away in the bottom of
the waggin&mdash;jest as Amandy did when her father died&mdash;and
I remaindid onsensible till we got to father's. Philo
was eny most skeart to death. "What ails ye?" says he.</p>

<p>"I've faintid away," retorterd I, "ye must git sumbody
to help ye lift me out when we git to father's." So he
druv as tight as ever he could and eny most jolted me to
death, and seein' father to work in the feeld he hollered to
him.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Mr. Ruggles, cum and help git yer dorter
out of the waggin&mdash;she says she's faintid away." So
father he cum, and he and Philo hawld me out head fust
and eny most kilt me doin' on't. Ketury she cum runnin'
out, and with her resistence I manidged to git into the
house and onto the bed. Ketury she sot down aside of me

<!-- page 130 -->

and father he sot down and went to mendin' the hoe
handle.</p>

<p>Arter Ide staid onsensible a spell, I open'd my eyes and
says I, "Is it true that my belovid mother's dead?"
"Yis," says father says he, "dead as a door nail, and I
hope now you've cum hum ye'll try to behave better'n ye
did afore ye went away&mdash;there's enuff to be did; for sen
Mirtilly got marrid, ev'ry thing's gone to rack."</p>

<p>"Mirtilly marrid?" interrigorid I.</p>

<p>"Yis," says father, "she's marrid marchant Van
Snorter&mdash;and did well tew&mdash;he's a makin' money fast."</p>

<p>"Grandfer grievous!" says I, "well, I 'spose Jake
jest took her 'cause she was my sister; but she's a fool to
git marrid so young, she's six year younger'n I be."</p>

<p>"She may be," says father, "and not be no chicken
nyther&mdash;the fact is, Milly, you're gittin' along, and he
bet a beef critter ye'll be an old maid."</p>

<p>"Me an old maid?" says I, "Ile tell ye what, old
feller, there's more young men than you could shake a stick
at that would jump sky high to git me."</p>

<p>"I gess they'de jump sky high <i>arter</i> they'de got ye."
says he.</p>

<p>I lookt at my hoggish payrent with a look of suverin'
contemp, and riz up and went into my chomber&mdash;Ketury
follerin'&mdash;and I tell'd Ketury I wanted to visit my mother's
grave, and she said she'd go long. So I huv Ketury's
black vail over my head&mdash;put my pencil and paper in my
ridicule&mdash;and we sot off. As we went along, me groanin'
and sobbin' the wost way, ev'ryboddy stared out of the
housen at me; but I never lookt at nobody. Well, we
cum to the grave-yard and clum over the fence and went
up to mother's grave. It had ben a rainin' and the grass

<!-- page 131 -->

was as wet as muck, but what did I ker! I huv myself
onto the ground and gin utteration to my greef jest as
Amandy did at her mother's grave. "O!" says I, "it
would a ben better if this spot had a receeved both the
mother and the dorter at the same minnit; better by a jug
full than for me to live to mourn over blastid hops and agonizin'
vikissitudes! but how perzumptuous am I to ropine
at the will of creation!" Sich was my words at my
mother's grave, where I sot</p>

<p class="small">"Like a fair lilly surcharged with tears."*</p>

<p class="small">[*Childern of the Abby: don't remember which chopter.]</p>

<p>Then I tell'd Ketury she needent wait for me&mdash;so she
went hum&mdash;and I took out my pencil and paper and writ
the follerin' stanzys in about 15 minnits:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>WELL, tew weeks passed away in the most molancholy
monner&mdash;the state of my mind wouldent
admit me to ingage in no occerpation if Ide a
wanted tew. Father he jawed cause I dident
work, and Nadab and Abihu made fun on me. I dident
do nothin' but romble in the woods and medders mournin'
and making poitry. On the hull my sittyation was most
miserably interestin'. I tell ye I mist the Childern of the
Abby (Spriggins had it ye know). If Ide a had that
twould a ben a gret comfort to me, and the circumstence
of my thinkin' so much about the enchantin' vollums conduced
me sumtimes to think about the swine Ide lent 'em
tew, and thinks me, he's more like Lord Mortimer arter
all than ary feller I ever knowd, for he sticks to me thro'
thick and thin jest as Lord Mortimer did to Amandy, and
then I rememberd Missis Stokeses advice to me in the
stage, and puttin' all things together, my feelins was considerable
channged, and I felt my sentiraints towerds the
youthful Jabez grown oncommon tender.</p>

<p>O! woman is a fraggle and lovin' creetur. The shemale
heart is so chuck full of affection that its purty onpossible

<!-- page 134 -->

to use it all up on one bein'. Who, I ax, would
want to live in this ere cold, onfeelin' world without a
kindred sperret to share its joys and sorrers with? and
when the swine that a young woman has placed her affections
on prove onconstant it's a pity if she maytent bestow
her heart on another more worthier one, and I haint a
speck of doubt but what Amandy'd a married Sir Charles
Bingley if Lord Mortimer had a ben raly faithless, and
it's a pity if I've got to be a dried up old maid jest a cause
Philander got married.</p>

<p>Sich was my circumflexions as I sot one day under the
gret ellum tree that growd afore our house. I must a
lookt very interestin' a settin' there in profound ponderation.
I had on a black skeart, and over it my white long
short with a row of black crape loopt up round the bottom
on't; then I had my leno vail wound round my head for
a turbin, and my ostridge fethers stuck into't, and there I
sot a leanin' on my elbow, now sythin' and now wipin' off
a tear that strickled down my cheek. Arter continuin' my
modifications a spell, I took out my pencil and writ the
follerin' piece of blank poitry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">A FRAGMENT.</p>

<p>O! she was fair! no anngel ever was<br/>

Nor ever could be fairer than Permilly;<br/>

Her auburn hair in greaceful tresses did<br/>

Hang down upon her sholders only jest<br/>

When she did stick it up with her high comb.<br/>

Her eyes was blue, her skin was snowy, and<br/>

Her cheeks was red as roses only jest<br/>

When she was in distress, then they was as<br/>

White as tew lillies: but neverstandin' all<br/>

Her beauty and her charms, she had as much<br/>

Trouble as any creetur ever had.<br/>

The swine she loved so well was faithless and<br/>

Went oft' and wed another maid; and then<br/>

<!-- page 135 -->

It seemd as if Permilly's heart would bust.<br/>

O! what a tender thing the shemale heart is!<br/>

So crammin', jammin', full of love and truth,<br/>

And faith, and hope, and pure affection, and<br/>

Some other things too numerous to mention!<br/>

No wonder when it's stuft so dretful full<br/>

A little blow should bust it&mdash;for it must<br/>

Be ivident to all obsairvin' folks<br/>

That when it's filld so full, the skin outside<br/>

Must be streckt dretfully and always in<br/>

Danger of bustin'.&mdash;So Permilly's heart<br/>

Has bust, and all the overplus run out,<br/>

But still there's quite a considerable of<br/>

Love and affection in it yit, and she<br/>

Has purty nigh made up her mind to giv<br/>

What's left to some more worthier object than<br/>

The faithless one. O! haste upon the wings of<br/>

Love, my dear Jabez&mdash;your Permilly feels as<br/>

If she could scarcely wait a minnit longer<br/>

For to behold thee, Jabez&mdash;Jabez, haste.</p>

</div>

<p>When Ide finished writin' the oversuin' lines I was jest
a guayne to retire into the house when I heerd sumbody
blowin' his nose; so I lookt up the road and as sure as
line a livin' creetur 'twas Jabez Spriggins a hossback.
The minnit I see him I run down street to meet him, and
when he see me cummin' he got right off his hoss and cum
towerds me. Well, I run right up and ketcht holt on him,
exclamigatin', "O! my Jabez! I'me overjoiced to see
ye."</p>

<p>He lookt wonderful supprised, and says he, "I dident
suspect to find ye so cosy, but I'm darned glad ye be.
The minnit I heerd ye'd cum hum I detairmined to follow
ye, but I had to wait till my quarter was out afore I could
cum, and the fust day arter my quarter was out I got on
my creetur and sot off arter ye for fear I should lose ye if
I dident hurry&mdash;I've got that are speech of Lord Mortimer's

<!-- page 136 -->

all by heart; ben a sayin' on't over all along the
roads so's not to forgit it, and I ruther guess I can say the
hull on't without missin' a word."</p>

<p>Well, I rushered him into the square room and sot
down, and he cum up to me and says he to me, "To call
you mine is the haight of my wishes&mdash;on your derision!
I rest for happiness. O! my Amandy!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say 'O! my Permilly!' " says I.</p>

<p>"O! my Permilly !&mdash;O! my Permilly !&mdash;there I
swon I've got up a stump," says he.</p>

<p>"No matter," says I, "you've proved to my satisfication
the devotedness of yer attachment, and Ile be yourn."</p>

<p>"Will, hay?" says he.</p>

<p>"Yis," says I, "now ye must imprint a kiss on my
rosy cheek." So he went to kiss me and whiskt off my
turbin. Arter Ide got my turbin adjested agin, says he,
"Well, when will you be reddy to git married?"</p>

<p>"Right off," says I.</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "Ile go and talk to the old man
about it."</p>

<p>"No, ye needn't," says I, "father never'll consent on
airth&mdash;he's dretfully oppozed to my gittin' married&mdash;but
Ile have ye neverstandin', and Ile tell ye how we'll manage.
You git on yer hoss and go strait to Utica and wait
there till I cum, and Ile contrive to get there afore long."</p>

<p>"That's the checker," says he.</p>

<p>So he surmounted his hoss and rid off, and I went in and
telld Ketury all about it, cause I knowd she wouldent tell
nobody. Says I, "I shall clear right out, and if father
axes arter me you tell him I've gone over to Skaticoke to
see Mirtilly" (Mirtilly had moved to Skaticoke). Ketury
was dretful pleased and said she'd do jest as I telld her to;

<!-- page 137 -->

and she promised to have my chist sent over to me as soon
as possible. So she and I we took a gret work pockit and
put my consairns into't that I wantid to be married in&mdash;then
I put on my travellin' habileations and arter imbracin'
Ketury I sot off for Dorrup. Well, 'twas five mile there,
and when I got there the stage had went out. So I went
over to old Mister Stokeses and telld 'em Ide found my
mother dead and concluded to go right back to Higgins
Patent cause Ide ort to be in my simminary. Well, they
telld me that old Mr. Stokes was a guayne to Utica in the
mornin' on bizness in his own waggin, and if I was a mind
to I mut go with him. "Well," says I, "I reckon I
will."</p>

<p>"But," says Missis Stokes, "where's yer chist?"</p>

<p>"O!" says I, "I reckond I wouldent be bothered with
it, and they're a guayne to send it on." Well, I stayd
there all night, and in the mornin' we sot off for Utica.
Old Stokes dident drive very tight, and so we was three
days a guayne to Utica&mdash;but as I want to eend my Recollections
in this chopter, I won't tell nothin' about the
jerney, tho' it was quite eventerful.</p>

<p>We arrove to Utica jest at the edge of the evenin' and
stoppt to Baggsis tavern, and I axt for a room and then I
drest myself as follers. I opend my gret ridicule and took
out my white long short and put it on, and thinkin' Ide
ort to have sum colors about me I betwisted a yaller ribbin
round the black crape trimmin' on the bottom on't&mdash;then
I put on my blue sash, and huv my artifishel reath kerlessly
round my sholders, then I done up my hair with my
high-toppt comb&mdash;took my leno vail and fastened one
eend on't into my comb, and so let it float over my sholders&mdash;then
I stuck my six ostridge fethers in on side of

<!-- page 138 -->

my comb, and tied a pink ribbin round my head to keep
'em in&mdash;and I tell ye I did look compleat.</p>

<p>Beein' thus attired I took my parrysol and sot out to
look up Spriggins, and you never in all yer born days see
sich a starin' as there was whilst I walkt up Ginnisee
Street&mdash;everybody cum to the doors and winders, and
ever so menny men and boys followerd arter me a hoorawin'
and makin' a turrible fuss&mdash;but I was so akustomed to
admireation I didn't mind it a bit, but plummenaded along
with the biggest onconsairn and dignitude. Well, arter
preambleatin' a number of streets, finally I cum round to
a place they called the "Reading Room," and I stopt to
the door and looked in. The room was full of gentlemen,
and as sure as a gun, in the midst on 'em was Mister
Spluttergut (the gentleman I met in the stage), and he
was a harangewin on 'em with the most oncomparalleled
eloquence, and they was all a listenin' with the biggest
attention.</p>

<p>Well, whilst I was a listenin' to the surprisin' and captivatin'
sentiments he pored forth consairnin' railroads and
canawls, I see suthin' yaller a stickin' up amonkst a mess
of heads in the fur eend of the room, and whilst I was a
wonderin' what 'twas, the heads moved, and lo and behold!
'twas the tip top of Jabezes hair. As soon as I
see him I skriekt out, "My Jabez! My Jabez!" and
rushed into the room&mdash;Jabez he see me and he lookt surprised
enuff&mdash;we squoze thro' the men, and when we
reacht one another I huv myself faintin' into the arms of
my adorin' Spriggins. I never see a surprisder set of
folks than the men in the Utica Readin' Room was that
minnit. They all gin way and fixt a seat for me&mdash;even
Mister Spluttergut stopt his harangew, exclamigatin',
"Quite an ok-kurrence."</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>Well, arter a spell one of the young men hild a lit segar
to my nose, and that fetcht me tew. So I riz up and takin'
hold of Sprigginses arm we perceedid to Baggses hotel.
Arter we arrove there Jabez axed me whether Ide be married
there or wait till we got to Higgins Patent.</p>

<p>"O here, certingly," says I, "in this ere celebrated hotel&mdash;in
the ginteelest sitty in creation."</p>

<p>So Spriggins went arter the justice, and there we was
marrid. As soon as the serrymony was overdone, husband
he calld for some pie and cheeze, and after weed eat it he
brung up his hoss, and as soon as Ide arrannged my travellin'
dress, he surmounted his creetur, and I, resisted by
a number of gentlemen, got on behind him, and I swonny
I bleeve the hull town of Utica was collectid to see us go,
and when we whipt up the hoss and sot off, they gin three
all-to-pieces cheers, in honor of us. Well, we went as
fast as the hoss could go with sich an oncommon heft and
arrove to Higgins Patent about leven o'clock at night.
Mother and Father Spriggins was abed, but they got up
and I tell ye they was awful glad to see me. The next
arternoon Aunt Huldy made quite an extensyve set down
for me, and if I dident cut a sworth it's no matter. But I
hadent ort to be tellin' what took place arter we was
marrid&mdash;'cause the Childern of the Abby don't say a word
consairnin Amandy arter her marridge&mdash;no more don't no
other novil I ever read say nothin' about the herowines
arter they git marrid. Howsumever, I can't help tellin'
how't we took a bridle tour the next week to all the most
celebratid places in the kentry&mdash;Utica, Rome, Whitesburrow,
Sockwait Springs, and Verona Spa&mdash;and I kept
a jernal along the road, and when P. Zebidee Gorum cum
a visitin' to see us I show'd it to him, and it affordid him

<!-- page 140 -->

the biggest satisfication; and it's in my persession yit&mdash;and
mabby at sum futur day Ile lay it afore the public.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>"THAT modest-looking white house that stands
somewhat isolated, whose is it? It seems the
abode of ease without pretension."</p>

<p>It belongs to Mrs. Lee, widow of Dr. Lee,
whose sudden death, some fifteen years ago, cast a gloom
over the whole community. He was in the prime of life.
Talent and probity had raised him to an enviable standing
in his profession, when by the mysterious ordering of
Divine Providence, he was cut off without a moment's
warning. Yet not, we trust, without preparation, for one
whose life, like his, is a constant exercise of Christian virtues,
cannot be unprepared for death, however or whenever
it may arrest him.</p>

<p>He had just returned from visiting some distant patients,
and was caressing his only child, when Mrs. Lee left the
room to make preparations for tea. A few moments after,
little Mary came running out, crying:

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"Mamma, I can't wake papa, do come and help me
wake papa!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee supposed, however, that he had fallen asleep
through weariness, and telling the little girl "not to disturb
papa," took her by the hand and led her softly back
into the apartment. But what a sight was she destined to
behold! Her husband had sunk back in his chair&mdash;and,
one glance at his face revealed the awful certainty&mdash;he
was dead! A piercing shriek rang through the house,
and then for many hours the wretched woman knew nothing
of what was passing around her. The horror and
agony of the first hour of returning consciousness, I
could not, if I would, depict.</p>

<p>It was long, very long, before she recovered from the
shock, for she had loved her husband devotedly. Yet
after his death she felt that she had not fully appreciated
his noble character. She knew not all his excellence until
he was gone. None but herself thought that Margaret
Lee had failed in any duty towards the departed. He had
never thought so. And yet before her mind arose a
thousand little errors and delinquencies, which her tender
conscience magnified into great faults and failures resulting
from gross selfishness. She did not say, as many would
in a like affliction, "He was my idol and therefore Heaven
has taken him from me." But she said, in the bitterness of
her heart, "I did not love him as I ought. I did not do
half that I might have done to make him happy, and thus
am I punished."</p>

<p>The weight of such a sorrow would have crushed her,
had not the care of her little daughter contributed to
divert her thoughts from running always in the same dark
channel. There had been a wonderful affection between

<!-- page 145 -->

this child and her father, whom she strongly resembled
both in features and disposition. She was but three years
old when he died, and for some time she could not comprehend
that he was to return no more. At every sound of a
carriage, or step in the hall, she would run out to meet
"papa." When at length she was made to understand
that he could not come back to her, but that if she was a
good girl she would one day go to him, she gave up looking
for her father, and seemed only desirous to be very
good, that she might go to him. Many times in the day
she would go to her mother, and folding her arms upon
her knee would say, "Now mamma tell Mary about papa."
And then the heart-broken mother told her of her father,
and the blessed place where he was waiting for them both.
As she looked at the bright little being who stood with her
dimpled hands resting on her mother's lap, and her deep,
thoughtful eyes turned up so earnestly to her face; she
trembled that one so pure and sinless should be left to her
weak and erring guidance.</p>

<p>"But God has committed her to me," said she, "and
He will help me." And earnestly did she pray for His
help.</p>

<p>Every evening when her mother was undressing her, the
little one never failed to ask the question, "Mamma, has
Mary been a good girl to-day?" And on receiving an
approving answer, she would say her prayer and go to
sleep very happy.</p>

<p>A few months after her father's death she was stricken
with the scarlet fever. For two days she suffered intensely,
and appeared scarcely conscious of anything save
her own pain. On the third, at evening, this abated, and

<!-- page 146 -->

the little girl as she lay in her mother's arms, looked up
and said faintly:</p>

<p>"Mamma, has Mary been a good girl to-day?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee pressed the precious child to her bosom and
whispered, "Yes, darling, Mary is always a dear, good
little girl."</p>

<p>An expression of perfect peace passed over the cherub
face. She murmured her childish prayer and then&mdash;fell
asleep&mdash;a long, quiet sleep it was, from which she awaked
in Paradise.</p>

<p>Who can understand the utter desolateness of the childless
widow as she sat alone in her solitary dwelling, from
which she felt that light and joy were forever departed!
And yet there was no other place on earth so dear to her.
It was the home whither she had come a bride, but a few
years before, and those few years had been by far the
happiest of her life. The happiest&mdash;yet clouded by the
greatest sorrow she had ever known. And here she
resolved to pass the rest of her days. She therefore
rejected all solicitations to return to the east, her former
home, and where her only surviving near relation, a
sister, still resided.</p>

<p>This sister who was many years older than Mrs. Lee,
had married very rich, and her family lived in a style and
moved in a circle wholly at variance with Mrs. Lee's taste
and circumstances. An annual visit of a few weeks was
all that she would promise them. From this visit she
always returned eagerly to her own unostentatious home,
and the graves of her buried treasures.</p>

<p>She no longer mingled in general society; it had lost
all attraction for her. Her visits were mostly visits of
mercy. She was not rich, but her income was much more

<!-- page 147 -->

than sufficient for her own expenditure; and the overplus
she devoted to charity. She was not like those careful
far-seeing persons who are always laying in store for a
"rainy day" to come, such days were constantly falling
in her pathway. They were the suffering and the needy,
and she thanked Heaven that one consolation remained to
her in the midst of her afflictions&mdash;the power sometimes
to alleviate those of others. She had few intimate friends,
for although there was that in her grief which invited sympathy,
the dignity of her manner checked all familiarity;
and those few only knew the real humility and sweetness
of her character.</p>

<p>Year after year passed away, and Mrs. Lee remained
the same. Unchanged in her simple habits and retiring
manners. Unchanged in her quiet, unobtrusive way of
doing good. Unchanged in her silent sorrow. Unchanged
in her mourning dress. She was a wonder to
many who knew that with her youth, her appearance,
and her station, she might, if she chose, be the idol of a
flattering crowd, the leader of fashionable society. And
they thought it "astonishing that she didn't at least go
into <i>second mourning</i>, which would be so much more becoming
to her style of beauty."</p>

<p>And so, with her loneliness and her prayers, her communings
with the departed and her labors of love, we will
leave her awhile.</p>

<p>In the outskirts of the same town, or what was then
the outskirts, stood a poor old house, which has long since
been demolished to make way for new ones. Old and
poor it certainly was, but still neat and comfortable. And
in it dwelt another widow and her only daughter. Mrs.
Grant had been the wife of an industrious and thriving

<!-- page 148 -->

mechanic, who left a prosperous business in a small village
not far distant, and came hither in the hope of doing
better. But unfortunately he soon fell into intemperate
habits&mdash;wasted his little property&mdash;died miserably and
left his wife and child to struggle with poverty as best
they might.</p>

<p>Susan, the girl, was too young then to do much, and
Mrs. Grant was obliged to work very hard to maintain
them both, and pay the rent of her small tenement. But
as Susan grew older she became very useful. When she
was thirteen or fourteen years of age, she learned the
business of dress-making; and in a few years was able to
earn a comfortable subsistence for herself and her mother.
The latter through anxiety and over-exertion, had become
prematurely infirm, and was only equal to the discharge
of her own household duties. These she performed while
Susan went her daily rounds amongst her employers. The
evenings they passed happily together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant was a truly religious woman, and she had
trained her daughter to piety and an abhorrence of everything
that is evil. The young girl was often thrown in
the way of temptation as she pursued her calling, but she
overcame it, and grew up good and virtuous, a pattern
of neatness and quiet industry. Everybody liked Susan
Grant. And when at length she married, almost everybody
thought she had done remarkably well to get George
Elmer, a young man of excellent principles and great
activity. In fact one who was called a very "enterprising
young man."</p>

<p>There were some, however, who pronounced him "visionary."
That is, wanting in stability and perseverance.
For although he was both active and intelligent, and

<!-- page 149 -->

always engaged in some sort of business, he never followed
any one occupation long enough to acquire much
proficiency, or realize much profit in it.</p>

<p>He had been a carpenter, a printer, a merchant's clerk,
had studied medicine a short time, law a still shorter time,
and had abandoned the last for dentistry, in which he was
engaged at the time of his marriage. Thus he went from
one thing to another, never exactly failing in any, but
always relinquishing each for something else which his
sanguine nature imagined would prove much more lucrative.</p>

<p>With this propensity to change, it is not surprising that
George Elmer laid up little or nothing. His family was
always comfortable it is true. But that was the result of
Susan's good management more than of his. Still he was
a very kind husband and father, and there was nowhere a
happier family to be found than theirs.</p>

<p>Susan's mother lived with them, and was regarded by
the affectionate young couple as a great blessing and comfort.
She did indeed make herself useful in many ways,
particularly in sharing with Susan the care of the children,&mdash;of
whom there were two,&mdash;bright pretty little creatures
as ever blessed a fireside.</p>

<p>When these were about six and four years old, George,
who had long since given up dentistry for something else,
and that again for something else, bought out a daguerrian
who was going to California, and began the business
on his own account.</p>

<p>For several months he worked vigorously at it, making
wretched likenesses, having a world of trouble with his
"chemicals," and consequently very little patronage, as

<!-- page 150 -->

there was a rival professor in the place, whose skill was
unquestioned.</p>

<p>But at length his efforts were crowned with success. He
fairly mastered the art. His "chemicals" worked admirably,
and he turned out pictures that were more life-like
than the originals themselves. His "Daguerrian Gallery"
became famous, and that of his rival dwindled into insignificance.
He had plenty to do. His pictures commanded
a good price. His circumstances began visibly to improve,
and he felt warranted in taking a larger and more
commodious house for his family.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things, when George Elmer suddenly
resolved to follow the example of his illustrious predecessor,
and go to seek his fortune in California. This
was in the early stage of the "gold excitement." The
daguerrian had not been heard from. But one other individual
had gone from the same place,&mdash;a shoemaker, the
first who had ventured,&mdash;and wonderful accounts of his
success had travelled back.</p>

<p>Susan Elmer heard the announcement of her husband's
intention with a heavy heart. She tried to dissuade him
from the undertaking. The perils of the journey, the
dangers of the climate, the uncertainty of success, and
the unavoidably long separation from his family in any
case, all these she represented to him, but in vain. He
saw no possibility of failure. His mind was made up.</p>

<p>"O George," said she, "we are doing well enough.
You are just beginning to realize something from your
present business, with a prospect of making a handsome
support in time."</p>

<p>"O but it takes such an everlasting while to get rich
here. I can make more in California in one year than I

<!-- page 151 -->

could here in my whole life-fime. Just think of Smith,
the shoemaker! he's making money like dirt. I don't
mean to be away over a year, and a year's soon gone you
know. And then&mdash;hurrah, Susy! we'll roll in gold
dust!"</p>

<p>Little Johnny who stood beside his mother, sobbing out
of sympathy with her, thought "<i>that</i> wouldn't be nice at
all, it wasn't pretty to roll in dust."</p>

<p>"We shall see, my son," said his father patting his
head, "we shall see."</p>

<p>Susan was silenced but not convinced. She saw that
her husband was fully resolved upon going. She therefore
ceased her opposition and went to work diligently to
prepare his wardrobe. But despite her efforts to look on
the bright side of things, she had many sad forebodings.
And so had Mrs. Grant. She thought it a great risk to
run for a very small gain.</p>

<p>Elmer sold out his daguerrian apparatus for much less
than it cost him, settled up his business, and prepared to
take his departure. Susan proposed that he should carry
with him his case of dentist's instruments. "It won't
take a great deal of room," she said, "and you may find
it necessary to do something besides dig for gold, before
you come back."</p>

<p>George laughed and said, "So I suppose you think
that the little I do succeed in turning up would be profitably
left behind in people's teeth."</p>

<p>But Susan, when she packed his trunk, put the case of
instruments in the bottom, thinking that at least they
would do no harm.</p>

<p>A sum of money that would have sufficed to support
them all in comfort for a year or more under Susan's careful

<!-- page 152 -->

management, was requisite for George Elmer's outfit
and travelling expenses, consequently he was unable to
leave them much. The man who had taken his daguerrian
apparatus, a Mr. Green,&mdash;not long resident in
the village&mdash;had not yet paid, but was to hand the money
to Mrs. Elmer in the course of a week or two. This,
George said, would be ample for all their expenses, until
he should send them a supply, which he hoped to do before
many months. And in a year or a year and a half at
the farthest, "he would be with them again. And then
they would have a house of their own&mdash;<i>such</i> a house too!"</p>

<p>And so George Elmer bade his wife and children farewell.
With some tears it is true, for he loved them dearly,
and it was for their sakes that he left them; yet with high
hopes and brilliant anticipations of a golden future. Poor
Susan could not speak at all. The little ones cried aloud,
and old Mrs. Grant as she pressed his hand in both her
own, said with a trembling voice: "God bless you, my
son, and bring you safely back again."</p>

<p>"Ask it of Him every day, mother," responded the
young man, "and all of you pray for me daily till we
meet again, as I surely shall for you. Keep up good
courage 'twill not be long after all&mdash;a year is soon gone."</p>

<p>For some little time after George's departure, his family
contrived to get along without incurring debts. But
Susan's small stock rapidly decreased. The winter was at
hand. Wood and many other necessaries ought to be purchased.
But so far from being able to procure these, she
had scarcely enough to supply their immediate wants. The
man Green, to her great disappointment, had left the place
without paying what he owed, and gone no one knew
whither. Very soon after her husband went away, she

<!-- page 153 -->

resumed her old occupation of dress-making, took the
work in, and devoted to it every moment of time that she
could spare from her other duties, which were rendered
heavier by the increasing feebleness of her mother. The
winter came. Another child was added to the little flock,&mdash;a
nice boy. His mother looked sadly in his unconscious
face and wondered "what would become of him."</p>

<p>"Trust in the Lord," said the grandmother.</p>

<p>"It is all I can do just now," Susan replied with a deep
sigh. About this time the rent fell due. Mrs. Elmer had
not the means to pay it. She therefore sold some of her
furniture to meet this and other expenses, for she was resolved
not to go into debt as long as it could possibly be
avoided.</p>

<p>Soon after this her heart was gladdened by intelligence
from George. He had reached San Francisco in safety,
and was about to start for the "diggins," and trusted soon
to send her some of the results of his labors. It was
cheering to know that he was alive and well, and Susan
plied her needle with renewed energy every moment that
her baby did not require her attention. Mrs. Grant,
though suffering under a slight paralysis, could still get
about with a cane, and assist somewhat in the household
labors. And Mary, the eldest child, was very good about
amusing the little one, who fortunately was not at all
fretful.</p>

<p>Still with all her exertions, it was very little that Susan
could earn by sewing. She had not regained her former
strength since the birth of her child. Never before had
she sewed so steadily. She felt that it was undermining
her health, but she was determined to struggle on and keep
out of debt until the promised aid should come from her

<!-- page 154 -->

husband. And what if she should receive no such aid?
What if George after all should be unsuccessful and finally
return as poor as he went away? At any rate, he should
have no debts of hers to discharge, even though she should
be obliged to part with every superfluity to avoid them.</p>

<p>As the winter wore on, expenses increased. The avails
of Susan's labor were quite inadequate to meet them, and
she accordingly sold several more articles of her furniture,
thinking that if all should end well, their loss could be
easily supplied.</p>

<p>The spring was somewhat advanced, when Smith, the
shoemaker, returned from California, and brought news of
George Elmer. But O, what news! He called to see
Susan, and thus his story ran. Poor Elmer had died
of the prevailing fever on the very day that Smith left San
Francisco. He had become discouraged with digging for
gold, gone to San Francisco, and returned to his former
occupation of house building, which was very profitable
there, and in which he would undoubtedly have done well,
had he not been taken down with the fever which carried
him off in a few days. Smith saw him the day before he
came away. George then did not believe that his illness
would terminate fatally, and hoped soon to resume his
work. He sent many affectionate messages to his family,
with a handsome gold brooch for Susan containing a lock
of his hair and a daguerrotype likeness, and requested
Smith to say to them that he should come home in six
months or thereabouts.</p>

<p>"But we all knew," continued the narrator, "that he
couldn't get well, he himself was the only one who had
any hope. The doctor told me then that he couldn't live
through the night. And so it proved. The next morning
I heard he was dead."</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>During this recital Susan Elmer sat like one turned to
stone. She uttered no cry. She spoke not a word. Nor
did she look towards Mr. Smith, when he took his departure.
The grandmother cried violently, and so did
little Mary who was old enough to understand something
of their loss. Johnny cried too. But for a long time
Susan remained in that same immovable state, grasping
the brooch as though it was all the world to her now.</p>

<p>I know not how long she would have sat thus, had not
the baby awaked from a long sleep in its cradle and begun
to cry. No mother's ear was ever deaf to such a sound.
Susan took up her little one and attended to its wants, and
then she wept. She remembered that it was fatherless.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you cry,my child," said her mother,
"I feared you never would."</p>

<p>"I feared so too, mother," said Susan, "and I thank
God that I can."</p>

<p>"Trust in the Lord," pursued the old woman. "He
will not forsake us." Susan did not reply.</p>

<p>As soon after this sudden and great affliction as Susan
could command her thoughts sufficiently for the task, she
tried to fix upon some plan by which her expenses might
be lessened, and her income increased. As a first step,
she disposed of all of her remaining furniture excepting
only the bare necessaries, and a small mantel clock, which
had been George's gift to her on the last anniversary of
their marriage. She then removed to a small house, or
rather two rooms of a house not far distant, at a much
lower rent, and though almost broken down with fatigue
and sorrow, applied herself more constantly than ever to
her needle. The poor have no time for <i>idle</i> grief.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>THE report of George Elmer's death soon reached
Mrs. Lee. This lady, of whom the reader
already knows something, had not heard of the
family before. At least not particularly, for she
resided at the opposite extremity of the place. She had
visited Elmer's daguerrian rooms, and remembered the
proprietor as an intelligent, well-mannered young man.</p>

<p>Had the poverty of the Elmers been generally known,
she would long since have made acquaintance with them.
But Susan was no complainer, and very few persons had
any idea of their destitution. In fact none save those who
had bought their furniture for less than half its real value.
And they were not the ones likely to interest themselves in
behalf of the poor.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Lee heard of George Elmer's death, heard
how suddenly and unexpectedly the blow had fallen upon
his poor wife. The name "widow" had always the
power to elicit her deepest sympathy, and Mrs. Elmer's
affliction affected her unusually. It was like the one great
sorrow of her own life. So unlooked-for and overwhelming.
Her heart went out towards the bereaved woman,
and she resolved to go and see her.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after a few days, she inquired the way and
went. It was after the family had removed. She knocked
at the door of the humble dwelling, and was admitted by

<!-- page 157 -->

Johnny, who showed her into the room where his mother
and the rest were collected. Susan's sad, worn face was
bent low over her sewing. The old mother was knitting
socks at sixpence per pair for a neighboring variety store,
and little Mary was holding the baby on her lap. When
Mrs. Lee announced her name, Susan and her mother rose
and welcomed her. They knew her by reputation.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Elmer," said Mrs. Lee, "I have heard of your
affliction, and am come, not to intrude upon your grief,
but to offer you the sympathy which none can so truly feel
as those who have experienced a like sorrow."</p>

<p>Susan thanked her kind visitor, while tears flowed freely
down her pale face. I need not repeat all the conversation
which ensued. Susan was not a great talker, but the little
she said impressed Mrs. Lee very favorably. As to the
latter, she possessed the happy faculty of saying just
enough, and just the right things. On this occasion she
completely won Susan's heart; for she was free alike
from that patronizing manner which offends the sensitive,
and that haughtiness which repels them. After conversing
some time with Mrs. Elmer and her mother, Mrs. Lee
turned to the children, and taking from her pocket some
sugar-plums, gave them to Johnny, telling him to divide
them with his sister.</p>

<p>"But you see," said Johnny, who was a very loquacious
little fellow, "she can't hold the sugar-plums and the baby
too, so if you'll please to take Georgey, then I'll give her
some."</p>

<p>Susan was somewhat alarmed at the boy's boldness, and
was beginning to check him, when Mrs. Lee reassured her
by saying, with a smile, to Johnny,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 158 -->

<p>"That's just what I want to do, if the baby will let me;
I don't like to frighten babies and make them cry."</p>

<p>"O, but our baby don't cry at strangers," said the
little boy eagerly, "he isn't afraid of anybody, he'll go to
you and stay as long as you want him to."</p>

<p>"He looks like a good baby," Mrs. Lee replied; "bring
him here, my dear, I'm a great friend to babies."</p>

<p>As the little girl advanced with the "infant prodigy,"
(as she and Johnny considered him,) Mrs. Lee observed
her more particularly than she had done before. She was
a very pretty child, and her deep blue eyes and light curling
hair brought to the mind of the lonely lady the
image of her own lost darling. She took the baby on her
lap, and putting her arm round his sister, asked what was
her name.</p>

<p>"Mary," the little girl answered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee's eyes filled with tears. She looked earnestly
in the child's face for a moment, kissed her cheek, and then
told her to go and get her share of the sugar-plums.</p>

<p>The baby fully sustained the reputation which Johnny
had given him, by laughing and crowing at Mrs. Lee, and
taking great liberties with her bonnet and shawl, to her evident
satisfaction. She had a great fondness for children,
although she was not wont to manifest it in the boisterous
manner of some. But while apparently wholly occupied
with the baby, she was not unobservant of the two older
children who retired to a corner for the purpose of dividing
her trifling gift. She was much pleased at the manner in
which this was done.</p>

<p>Mary counted them (Johnny could not count so many)
and divided them into two equal portions, one of which
Johnny poured into her apron.</p>

<!-- page 159 -->

<p>"And here's two more because you're the biggest,"
said he, taking a couple from his own share and adding
them to hers.</p>

<p>But Mary objected to this arrangement. "No, Johnny,
you must keep a whole half and two more because you're
the littlest, you know;" and she put four of them back in
her brother's apron.</p>

<p>"No, Mary, that isn't the way," Johnny began, and I
know not how much longer they would have argued the
point, had not a knock at the door interrupted them.</p>

<p>The new arrival was no less a personage than Mrs.
Smith, wife of the returned shoemaker of that name. She
lived not far from the Elmers' present abode, and having
seen Mrs. Lee go there, thought she would take that occasion
to make a <i>friendly</i> call, and find out the object of
that lady's visit. It was reported that Smith had come
back rich. He had indeed a good deal of money and was
making quite a noise about it. He had followed his business
while absent, and found it much more profitable than
digging in the mines. But of this he said nothing. He
merely said, "he'd been to California, and there was no
farther necessity for his making shoes; he meant to drive
a bigger business." His help-meet, who had long pined
for "a large house and a hired girl," was now about to
have these wishes realized. She therefore felt "as good
as anybody!"</p>

<p>But we shall have more to do with her hereafter, therefore
we will dismiss her for the present. Soon after her
entrance Mrs. Lee took leave.</p>

<p>As she walked homewards she reflected upon the little
incident connected with the sugar-plums, the entire absence
of selfishness shown by both the children in the division of

<!-- page 160 -->

what was to them quite a treasure. She conjectured, and
with reason too, that such a disposition had not been
formed or cultivated by any particular course of training
pursued by their parents, but must be the natural result of
perfect unanimity between those parents. This was the secret.
George and Susan Elmer were not wise or learned
persons. They had no theory of family government&mdash;no
system of "suasion" upon which they acted. But they
had no differences. They agreed in every thing. With
this example of mutual confidence and respect before them,
how could the children be other than they were, loving and
obedient?</p>

<p>That evening, when these little ones knelt by their
mother's knee to say their prayers, Mary, who repeated
hers first, voluntarily added the name of Mrs. Lee to those
for whom she daily prayed; and her brother followed her
example. Thus ran the simple petition.</p>

<p>"O God! forgive all my sins, and make me a good
child, and bless my dear father, and mother, and grandmother,
and brothers, and Mrs. Lee, and everybody, for
Jesus Christ's sake. Amen!"</p>

<p>After the children had gone to bed, Mrs. Grant said to
her daughter,</p>

<p>"Susan, is it right to let the children pray for their
father now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mother," replied the sorrowful woman.
"I have thought a good deal about it myself, but somehow
I cannot bear to tell them they must no longer ask
God to bless their father. It seems like breaking the last
link between him and us, and something tells me it is better
to let them do it. It cannot do them any harm, and
surely it cannot hurt poor George, can it, mother?"</p>

<!-- page 161 -->

<p>"Just so, it cannot, my child, and I don't believe it will
be laid to your charge as a sin."</p>

<p>Thus answering, the old mother took off her spectacles
and wiped the tears from her eyes, and the two worked on
for some time in silence. At length Mrs. Grant said,</p>

<p>"Susan, what a difference there is between folks!"</p>

<p>"A very great difference, mother. Were you thinking
of Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Smith? I was at that moment."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were the persons I had in my mind when I
spoke. I noticed the contrast more, I suppose, because
they happened to be here at the same time. What a perfect
lady Mrs. Lee is! how kind and pleasing in her
manners!"</p>

<p>"She is indeed. It seems to me I never before realized
how much there is in kind words. I have felt better ever
since."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were what the Bible calls 'words fitly
spoken.' But that Mrs. Smith! Somehow I can't help
thinking she only came to spy out the nakedness of the
land! can you?"</p>

<p>"It did appear so certainly, but you know it isn't right
to judge from appearances. She may mean very well,
though she isn't at all like Mrs. Lee."</p>

<p>"Very true; she may mean well, and have an odd way
with her."</p>

<p>It was evident to Mrs. Lee that the Elmers were very
poor. The apartment in which she had found them,
although it had an air of comfort which cleanliness and order
always give to even the meanest abode, yet betokened
extreme indigence, and she thought it strange that George
Elmer should have left his family so destitute. She inquired

<!-- page 162 -->

farther concerning them, of Harriet, her maid, who
was one of the knowing kind.</p>

<p>Harriet was able to give her the required information,
for she had found out a good deal about them from the
Ludlows, who had bought no small part of Mrs. Elmer's
furniture.</p>

<p>"O yes, I meant to tell you about 'em," said she, "for
I thought likely you'd do something to help 'em. They're
dreadful poor I guess, though he left 'em quite comfortable
when he went away. But she's been sick a good deal
since, and they seem to have run out pretty much. She
takes in sewing, and the old woman knitting; but I guess
it's precious little they earn, for since she heard of his
death, she's left the good house they lived in, and sold off
the chief of her furniture very low indeed. Mrs. Ludlow
bought a nice set of chairs, and a handsome bureau, besides
several other things of her. She said she thought it
was a deed of charity to take 'em; but for my part, I
thought Mrs. Ludlow got a bargain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee no longer hesitated. She procured a quantity
of knitting yarn, and the next morning set out with it for
the house of Mrs. Elmer. After some little conversation
with the women, she said, laying the package on the table,</p>

<p>"I have brought yarn for Mrs. Grant to knit into
stockings forme. She can do them at her leisure, as I
shall not need them until next fall."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant thanked her, and Mrs. Lee turned the conversation
to other subjects. She talked with Susan about
the children, especially Mary, in whom she already felt an
unusual interest.</p>

<p>"Your little girl is like my own, and you must spare
her to me for a day now and then."</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>Susan acquiesced cheerfully in this proposal, and it was
settled that Mary should go to Mrs. Lee's one day during
the following week. Harriet was to come after her.</p>

<p>"O I shall be so glad!" exclaimed the light-hearted
child; "but then who'll help mother take care of the
baby?"</p>

<p>"I can do that," said Johnny, straightening up with an
air of importance. This difficulty disposed of, another
suggested itself to Mary's mind.</p>

<p>"Mother," she whispered, looking down at her patched
and faded clothes, "What shall I do? my frock is real
rusty."</p>

<p>"You have another, my dear;" and Susan colored
slightly.</p>

<p>"I know it, but that's just as rusty as this you know."</p>

<p>"Never mind the frock," said Mrs. Lee, smiling. "It
is Mary and not the frock that I care about."</p>

<p>Then calling Johnny to her, she gave him a gay wooden
soldier, and rose to go. At the same time she drew from
her pocket a five dollar bank note, and proffering it to
Mrs. Grant, said,</p>

<p>"I will pay you now for the knitting."</p>

<p>"I thank you, but I can't change that," said the old
woman; "and besides I don't know how much to charge
until I see how many stockings the yarn will knit."</p>

<p>"Keep it all if you please," returned Mrs. Lee; "there
is none too much; the yarn will knit several pairs, and
knitting is slow work; we should always consider the
time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant saw at once, and appreciated with heart-felt
gratitude the good lady's delicate manner of bestowing
a charity. She thanked her again, and not without tears

<!-- page 164 -->

in her eyes. Mrs. Elmer joined her mother in expressions
of gratitude, and Mrs. Lee, after a few more words with
the children, and a kiss to the baby, took her departure.</p>

<p>"What a woman!" exclaimed Mrs. Grant; "she
didn't even ask me what I charged. There's not many
who do so, Susan."</p>

<p>"Not many indeed. She is one of a thousand."</p>

<p>"I feel as if the Lord had raised us up a friend who
knows how to pity us, for she is a widow herself."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is a widow, and that's enough to bear without
being poor like us, mother."</p>

<p>The old woman thought there was something like a
murmur in these words, and it grieved her.</p>

<p>"Look there, Susan!" she said, pointing to the children,
"the Lord leaves you all those; yet he saw fit to
take from Mrs. Lee the only one she had."</p>

<p>Susan turned her tearful eyes towards the little ones,
then clasping her hands, said in a low voice, "Thy will be
done."</p>

<p>It was indeed a pleasant sight. The baby was in the
cradle, crowing over the soldier which Johnny had put
into his hands, while the other children sat, one on each
side, watching his performances with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You like my <i>trainer</i> don't you, baby!" said the little
boy. "Mrs. Lee's a nice lady, isn't she, baby? I mean
to keep my trainer always, wouldn't you, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes,I would," answered his sister, "but then you'll
have to take it away from baby, for he'll soon have the
paint all off."</p>

<p>"Sure enough, I never thought of that. I'll get him
something else." So he ran and brought a cord with several
empty spools strung upon it, a plaything which became

<!-- page 165 -->

a novelty by the occasional addition of another spool,
and aided by Mary succeeded in extricating the trainer from
his perilous situation, and in pacifying the baby, who was
at first disposed to grumble at the exchange.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Mrs. Lee had said that she should not
need the stockings for some months to come, Mrs. Grant
determined to go to work upon them immediately, as
"there was no knowing what might happen." On opening
the package of yarn, she found in it a note directed
to Mrs. Elmer. It contained a few kind words and the
sum of twenty dollars. At this additional proof of Mrs.
Lee's goodness, Susan's tears flowed afresh, and her
mother said,</p>

<p>" 'He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord;'
that woman is surely laying up treasures in heaven."</p>

<p>When little Mary went to pay the promised visit to
Mrs. Lee, she wore a neat new calico frock, and she said to
the lady, "My mother told me I must thank you for my
new frock."</p>

<p>The child was very happy that day, looking at books
and pictures, and talking with Mrs. Lee about them.
Then running out into the pleasant garden among the
many beautiful spring flowers, and expressing her childish
wonder and delight to Peter Jackson, the colored man who
was working there, asking him a hundred questions which
Peter good-naturedly answered. Then back again into
the house, to wonder and exclaim at the variety of interesting
objects there. In Mrs. Lee's own room she saw a
child's chair, which delighted her greatly.</p>

<p>"O what a pretty chair!" she exclaimed; "I had just
such a one when we were in the other house, but I think
mother has given it away; the house where we live now is

<!-- page 166 -->

too little to hold many chairs. May I sit down in it, Mrs.
Lee?"</p>

<p>This had been little Mary Lee's chair; no child had
ever sat in it since her death. It was guarded as a sacred
relic, and more closely associated with its owner than any
other of her little possessions so carefully preserved by the
bereaved mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may sit in it, my dear," said Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"It seems exactly like my own chair," pursued the
child as she rocked backwards and forwards in it. "I
always used to sit in mine when mother and father were
reading. And too, I used to sit in it when I was learning
my hymns after mother."</p>

<p>"Say me some of your hymns, darling."</p>

<p>Mary repeated the simple verses that her mother had
taught her, and wondered why Mrs. Lee cried so all the
while.</p>

<p>"It must be" thought she, "because she feels so sorry
that my father is dead." So she thought she would say
something to comfort Mrs. Lee, and pausing in the
midst of her hymn, she laid her hand on the lady's arm,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, don't cry so Mrs. Lee, <i>that's</i> a great deal better
place than this, there's no trouble <i>there</i>, and nobody ever
dies, and all good people shall see each other there again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee looked wonderingly in the face of her little
comforter. The deep blue eyes, so like those that had
once been turned lovingly up to her own as she talked of
heaven and the angels, were fixed upon her. It seemed
as though the spirit of her sainted child was looking through
them into her very heart, and tenderly rebuking her long-cherished
sorrow. A feeling of awe stole over her, and

<!-- page 167 -->

pressing her lips to the forehead of the little girl, she arose
and led her from the room.</p>

<p>Mary went home at evening, as happy as child could be.
She carried a basket containing several nice books for herself
and Johnny, some pretty stuff to make frocks for the
baby, and a bottle of cordial for her grandmother. There
was also a mysterious package for her mother, neatly tied
up, which Mary was very curious about, but she was too
well-bred to ask questions. This was a suitable mourning
shawl for Mrs. Elmer. Mrs. Lee accompanied the little
girl home, and frequently offered to relieve her. But Mary
insisted upon carrying the basket all the way, declaring
that it wasn't the least bit heavy. And as she trudged
along she chattered incessantly.</p>

<p>"O won't they be glad when I come? How Johnny
will jump when he sees his book! and won't the baby look
pretty in his new frocks! his old ones are growing so
small, mother hasn't got him any in ever so long. I
wonder if the little rogue has missed me. It seems a great
while since I went away this morning, I never was gone
so long before."</p>

<p>Thus she rattled on; and Mrs. Lee, who had resolved
upon asking Mrs. Elmer to let her take little Mary, to
be trained and educated as her own daughter, abandoned
the idea when she saw how the child loved her home and
family. Nay, she almost reproached herself for having entertained
it. But she had conceived a strong affection for
the little creature, and determined to do all that she could
for her, without having her constantly under her own eye.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the house, Mary rushed up to
the baby, whom his mother was undressing, and nearly
smothered him with kisses.</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>"O baby, I've got something for you," she said, waving
the basket triumphantly. "And, Johnny, you don't
know what I've got for you. And, grandmother, something
for you too. And for you, mother. And I've had
such a nice time. If Johnny had only been there"&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will hear about it by-and-by," said her mother,
as she rose and pressed Mrs. Lee's hand. Mary stopped
abruptly, when she remembered who was in the room, and
taking off her bonnet and cape, sat down quietly with the
baby in her arms, somewhat impatient it is true, to display
the contents of the basket and relate her adventures. In
fact, she could not help whispering them over for the
baby's benefit, beginning each description thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what do you think, baby,&mdash;I saw&mdash;And
what do you think, baby! Mrs. Lee said&mdash;And where
do you think, baby! Harriet went"&mdash;</p>

<p>From this time the circumstances of the Elmers were
much improved. Many comforts were added to their humble
dwelling through the kindness of their new friend, who
soon began to consider the subject of assisting them to hire
a more comfortable house. She had determined to do so,
and was intending to speak of it to Mrs. Elmer very
shortly, when she was summoned to attend the dying-bed
of her sister. She had not time to see the Elmers before
leaving. She however penned a hasty note to Susan, in
which, after stating the cause of her sudden departure, she
expressed the wish that Mrs. Elmer would seek a better
house, and to enable her to do so, she enclosed an amount
sufficient to pay a quarter's rent, as well as what would be
due on leaving her present abode, and something over. "I
cannot tell," she wrote, "how long I may be absent, perhaps
several months. If you should want any assistance

<!-- page 169 -->

before I return, do not hesitate to write to me immediately"
(here she gave the address). "I shall consider it
a privilege to aid you. Tell my little Mary to come to my
garden for flowers whenever she likes, Peter will always
give them to her, and may the God of the widow and the
fatherless bless and keep you all."</p>

<p>This note she gave to Harriet, telling her that it was important,
and she wished it to be carried to Mrs. Elmer as
soon as she should be at leisure. Harriet was very busy at
the time, assisting in Mrs. Lee's preparations for leaving in
the afternoon run. Setting the house in order. Scattering
moth-preventives from garret to cellar. Folding,
hanging, spreading this, that and the other for safe keeping,
and what not. Besides which she had her own trunk to
pack, for she was to go to her father's, ten miles distant,
in the stage, which usually went out about an hour after
the cars. There she would remain until Mrs. Lee's return.
The door-key was to be entrusted to Peter Jackson, the
worthy colored man already spoken of, who always slept in
the house during Mrs. Lee's absences. Harriet took the
note saying, as she put it carefully in her reticule&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will run down with it as soon as I see you off."</p>

<p>She really intended to do so. She would not for the
world have told a lie, or wilfully failed in duty to her mistress,
but&mdash;alas poor human nature!</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>AS soon as Mrs. Lee had gone, Harriet prepared for
her own departure. She dressed herself hastily,
fastened the window-shutters, dragged her trunk
to the porch, locked the door and ran down to
Peter's with the key. After delivering Mrs. Lee's directions
to Peter, she went to the stage-house to bespeak her
passage. Being told that the stage would call for her in
about an hour, she hurried back to carry the note to Mrs.
Elmer, who lived in another direction.</p>

<p>As she was passing Deacon Ludlow's, which was nearly
opposite Mrs. Lee's, Miss Eunice called to her from the
window. The Ludlows had been watching the proceedings
at Mrs. Lee's with great interest all the morning. They
had seen that lady depart, evidently on a journey, and it
was much earlier than she usually made her annual visit
east. But Harriet would come in and tell them all about
it soon. When, however, they saw that she too was preparing
to go away, they felt a slight degree of uneasiness;
and seeing her at length actually about to pass their house
without stopping, they feared losing her altogether and not
finding out anything, and therefore arrested her progress as
above stated.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Harriet?" exclaimed the mother
and three daughters, all in a breath.</p>

<p>"O I've got to go up street on an errand, but I'll stop
and say good-by when I come back."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"O stop now, stop now; can't you?"</p>

<p>"Well I suppose I may as well come in a minute now,
the stage don't go in nearly an hour yet."</p>

<p>And so she went in, to the great relief of the Ludlows.
Harriet, although as honest and faithful a girl as ever lived,
had a great <i>talent</i> for gossiping, and not being encouraged
to exercise it at Mrs. Lee's, was very glad to indulge in an
occasional outpouring at Deacon Ludlow's, where it was
fully appreciated and drawn out. In fact they made a
good deal of her there, always invited her to attend the
weekly prayer-meeting whenever it was held at their house,
and noticed her in several ways in order to keep her good
natured. Of course the simple-minded girl was flattered
by such attentions, and often "ran in," after her work was
done up, to chat an hour or so with them. She had no
suspicion of the estimation in which they really held, or
professed to hold, her among their acquaintances, to whom
they frequently remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a pert, forward thing that Harriet is! I wouldn't
keep such a creature round <i>me</i>, but I guess Mrs. Lee's not
very particular who she has, if she only gets her work
done."</p>

<p>Had Harriet known of this, she never would have gone
in there again. Not so much on her own account as Mrs.
Lee's, with whom she had lived nearly seven years without
a wish to change her place, and whom she regarded as approaching
nearer to perfection than any other living person.</p>

<p>On this occasion the Ludlows had a thousand questions
to ask; and Harriet, in her zeal to tell all the whys and the
wherefores, the hows and the whens of Mrs. Lee's movements,
as well as her own, allowed her minute to be a very
long one. After running on for half an hour with great

<!-- page 172 -->

velocity, she jumped up suddenly, declaring she <i>must</i> go,
for she'd got to take a note to Mrs. Elmer. But then she
was assailed with another volley of questions, on the subject
of Mrs. Lee's intercourse with the Elmers, and she could
not resist the temptation to sit down a moment longer and
tell about Mrs. Lee's kindness to that family, at least as
much as she knew about it, for she had often been sent
there with vegetables and other things. "And sometimes
there was such a load that Peter Jackson had to go with
it."</p>

<p>"O, she does a great deal for them, and there's many a
poor family can say the same. She's always doing good,
I never saw the beat of it; why, some folks would get rich
on what she gives away"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder if she don't expect to ride to heaven on her
good works," said Mrs. Ludlow.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that's a pretty sure-footed horse any
way," responded Harriet with some warmth.</p>

<p>"O Harriet, Harriet!" said Mrs. Ludlow solemnly,
"I'm sorry to hear you speak so, it shows what influence
you've been under. Don't you know the Bible says our
own righteousness is but filthy rags? Nothing but a living
faith can save us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it, a <i>living</i> faith, and that's just Mrs.
Lee's kind of faith, for 'faith without works is <i>dead</i>,' the
same Bible says, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you read your Bible," said Mrs. Ludlow with
a slight sneer, for she felt a little chagrined that the girl
was able to give her blow for blow with her own weapons.
Harriet noticed the sneer and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I won't take credit that isn't my due. I own I
don't read my Bible as much as I ought to, though I've no

<!-- page 173 -->

excuse, for I've got a beautiful one that Mrs. Lee gave me.
But I <i>hear</i> it read every night and morning, so I know
something about what's in it."</p>

<p>Perhaps she would have made a few more quotations,
had she not at that moment heard the stage horn.</p>

<p>"O dear me! what shall I do! there's the stage and I
haven't carried the note to Mrs. Elmer!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Miss Eunice, "Sam can run down
with it, or one of us can take it to Mrs. Elmer!"</p>

<p>Poor Harriet had no resource but to accept Miss Ludlow's
offer. So she gave her the note saying that it was very
important, and she would like her to have it sent as soon
as possible. She then hastened out, and saw the stage
still at a little distance off, taking in some passengers. At
the same moment she observed Sam Ludlow standing by
Mrs. Lee's gate watching the approach of the stage.</p>

<p>"I'll give it to Sam myself," said she, turning back to
the window in time to see the four Ludlows' heads close
together over the note, which Miss Eunice was holding up
to the light. Just in the midst of their comments upon it,
they were startled by the voice of Harriet shouting,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give it to me! there's Sam by our house."</p>

<p>Eunice could do no less than surrender the note, though
she would gladly have kept it a little longer to satisfy herself
in regard to its contents. Harriet was somewhat vexed
at the curiosity of the Ludlows, and felt glad to get the
note back again, she thought it was much better to give it
to Sam herself, and see him start with it, then she should
feel as though it would reach its destination safely. Sam
Ludlow was a lubberly boy of fourteen. He was often
hanging about Mrs. Lee's gate, and had several times gone
on errands for Harriet, for which she always paid him a

<!-- page 174 -->

sixpence in advance. Sam was very fond of a sixpence,
and was much more ready to do errands for Harriet than
for his mother or sisters, as they would not pay him.</p>

<p>"Here, Sam," said she, "I want you to take this note
to Mrs. Elmer right away, I'm going in the stage and
haven't time."</p>

<p>"Who was your waiter last year?" was Sam's reply.</p>

<p>Harriet knew that this was the way in which the interesting
youth usually answered his sisters when they requested
him to do anything, and she remembered that she
had always paid him for waiting upon her. But she had
now no change in her purse, her money was in bills, she
could only promise a reward, she however persevered.</p>

<p>"Do take it for me,Sam, that's a good fellow, and when
I come back I'll give you a shilling."</p>

<p>"Give it to me now."</p>

<p>"I can't, I haven't got the change, my money is all in
bills. Will you take it? see, the stage is close by, I'll
surely pay you the shilling when I come back, and that
will be before long I expect."</p>

<p>"Swear you'll do it."</p>

<p>"No, Sam, I won't swear, that's wicked; but I solemnly
promise."</p>

<p>"Well, kiss my jack-knife then, it's all the same in
Dutch." And he took out the weapon so dear to every
boy's heart, and held it up before her. They were lifting
her trunk to the stage top.</p>

<p>"Will you carry the note if I'll kiss that?"</p>

<p>"As sure as gunflints."</p>

<p>"And right away, without going home first?"</p>

<p>"Right off, as quick as a streak 'o lightning."</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" shouted the driver.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>Harriet kissed the jack-knife, gave Sam the note, and
jumped into the stage, calling after Sam to be very careful,
and not loiter a moment on the way. As she
stretched her neck out of the stage window, she had the
satisfaction of seeing the young gentleman start on his expedition;
not quite so quick as lightning, but at a very
brisk pace.</p>

<p>His sisters called to him from the window, but he hurried
on without noticing them. Not so much that he
wished to do his errand faithfully, as because "he didn't
care for them."</p>

<p>"She's mighty anxious about this note, seems to me,"
said Sam, mentally, as he went on his way.</p>

<p>"Wonder what it's about! feels as though there was
something in it&mdash;shouldn't wonder if 'twas money&mdash;pay
for sewing I 'spose."</p>

<p>The note had been hastily written, and the envelope
fastened lightly with a wafer. Sam thought he'd like to
just see what was inside. Harriet was only a hired girl,
what did he care for her! Some other vague thoughts
floated through his mind. He determined to open it; he
could easily stick it together again if he wanted to. So
he turned to see whether the stage was out of sight. It
was no longer visible.</p>

<p>A few paces on he turned aside into a narrow lane,
went behind an old shed, no mortal eye was upon him, he
felt quite safe; and, taking out his jack-knife, he slipped
the blade under the wafer, which yielded without difficulty,
and Sam found his conjectures correct. There was
money, more money than he had ever seen together before.
He blundered through the note as well as he could,
and found that the money was a gift, not from Harriet,

<!-- page 176 -->

but from Mrs. Lee. He thought of several things that he
wanted very much, especially a fighting-cock, owned by a
man who kept a ten-pin alley, and numerous other articles
quite as useful and desirable. The temptation was strong.
He saw that the amount was not mentioned in the note.
There were several bills; he could take one, it never
would be found out. So he stuffed a "five" into his
pocket, wet the wafer a little and fastened it down again,
and then contemplated his work with satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was well done. Nobody would ever have suspected
that the note had been opened. He went on a few steps,
and then paused to contemplate it again; and as he did so
he reflected, "Why not take the whole while it was in his
power? But Harriet and Mrs. Lee would come back,
and then he would be found out. What then?" "Never
mind," said the tempter in his ear. "The old man'll
have to fork over, that's all, and you'll have the good of
the money."</p>

<p>"And the old woman," thought Sam, "how she'll jaw
and jaw, if I'm ever found out."</p>

<p>"Never mind that neither," pursued the tempter,
"they can't blame you, they expect you to <i>cut up</i> now,
you aint converted yet."</p>

<p>"So here goes," said Sam, and he tore open the envelope,
took out the rest of the money, chewed the note until
it became a soft wad, then threw it at the old shed, where
for aught I know to the contrary, it is sticking to this day.
He then took his way to the residence of the game-cock's
owner, where he astonished divers <i>young gentlemen</i> by his
display of the <i>ready</i>, although he was careful not to exhibit
the whole amount in his possession. It was a strange
thing to see Sam Ludlow with more than a shilling in his

<!-- page 177 -->

hands, and of course the "five" which he drew from his
pocket created some surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Sam, where did you get so much?" "Found
the way to the old man's locker?" "Old boy loosened
his purse strings at last, eh?" were some of the questions
showered upon the young thief. But he contrived to
evade them. "Pity if he couldn't have a little money as
well as other folks. He didn't see what there was to
make such a thundering fuss about."</p>

<p>When Sam left the ten-pin alley, his five was nearly
exhausted. He had entered to his heart's content into
the amusements of the establishment. A thing which he
had not been able to do before for want of funds. He
had also regaled himself with various good things; and as
he walked homewards with his long-desired game-cock
under his arm, he felt a high degree of satisfaction; for,
notwithstanding he had lost all that he staked in the
games, he still had a large sum left, upon which he meant
to revel for a long time to come.</p>

<p>On his arrival at home, his sisters questioned him concerning
the note. But he gave them no satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Didn't you notice what was in it when she opened
it."</p>

<p>"No; I didn't go in the house at all."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to know whether there was money
in that note. Why didn't you wait a minute and see, you
stupid fellow!"</p>

<p>"What do you s'pose I cared about knowing what was
in the plaguey note? What business was it of mine?"</p>

<p>The game-cock did not attract much attention at the
deacon's. Sam was always bringing home something of
the animal kind to annoy the family, and generally bargained
it away for something else in a few days.</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>Deacon Ludlow, although himself a worthy, religious
man, unfortunately took very little pains with the early
training of his children. He never questioned Sam in regard
to where he spent his evenings. In fact, he seldom
reproved him for anything. Mrs. Ludlow, it is true,
scolded and fretted at the boy frequently, but he regarded
her words no more than the idle wind. Sam Ludlow had
started in the road to destruction, and there was no voice
to call him back.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Elmers wondered what had become of Mrs.
Lee. Many days passed without one of her welcome
visits. The chatty, good-natured Harriet,
too, they missed her almost daily calls. And it
was but natural that they should miss the comforts she
was wont to bring. After some time it was settled that
they must have gone away. At length they questioned
Peter Jackson as he was passing one day, and from him
they learned the facts.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Mrs. Lee's departure, Mrs.
Elmer's mother was suddenly reduced to a state of entire
helplessness by another paralytic stroke. She was confined
wholly to her bed. Her mind also was greatly affected,
and she showed an irritability and fretfulness quite
foreign to her nature. Susan's labors were increased ten-fold
by this calamity. Her mother required more care

<!-- page 179 -->

than an infant, and could not bear to have Susan out of
her sight for a moment. Her speech was much impaired,
but her sight and hearing were, if anything, quickened.
She would have the window-curtains down, for the broad
daylight hurt her eyes. The children's noise disturbed
her very much, and Susan was obliged to send the two
older ones out of doors to play, many times when she
would gladly have kept them in. Her sewing too, had to
be almost wholly abandoned. She had but little time for
it during the day, and then the room was so dark that she
could scarcely see at all. When the evening came, and
the little ones were all gone to their rest, the old mother,
too, at last asleep, and Susan sat down with her work in
hand, she was usually so worn and weary that her fingers
almost refused to move.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way for a month, and Susan's
resources were nearly gone. She had for some time past
reduced her own and her children's food to the smallest
possible quantity, and that of the coarsest kind. A little
of a better quality she still managed to procure for her
mother, and the old woman complained that this was not
as good as she wished. Susan knew that her poor mother
was not herself any longer, and she never manifested the
least impatience with her murmuring. But she missed her
encouraging words, the "trust in the Lord, my child,
He will not forsake you," with which she used to cheer
her in times of despondency. And she thought if her
mother would only speak so now, she could bear up better
under her trials.</p>

<p>And George, too, how she missed <i>him</i> now! more than
ever&mdash;more every day. She could not help it. The
future looked very dark. Pay-day was drawing on, and

<!-- page 180 -->

where was her rent to come from! Pay-day came, and
Susan was not ready. The landlord, a hard-fisted, grasping
man, called for his dues. Mrs. Elmer told him it
was utterly impossible for her to pay then, she had not a
dollar, but if he would give her a few days'time, she hoped
to be able to satisfy him. He appeared to doubt her
word, and pointing to the mantel-clock (George's last
gift before he went from home), he intimated a wish to
take possession of it.</p>

<p>"I'll take that," he said, "seeing you don't seem to
have anything else that's worth much; though it's a poor
concern, still, I don't know but I'll take it and let you off,
considering."</p>

<p>Susan looked at him with astonishment. She was not
accustomed to such meanness. She knew that the clock
had cost more than double the amount of her debt, and
she knew that the man must be aware of its value. She
hesitated a while. It went to her heart to part with it.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say? shall I take it?"</p>

<p>"It is a valuable clock, sir, it cost more than twice as
much as I owe you, and has not been in use a year yet."</p>

<p>The man advanced close to her, and impertinently examined
her brooch, which she always wore.</p>

<p>"That'll do," said he, after satisfying himself that it
was real gold. "I'll take that if you aint a mind to let
the clock go. I'll take it and say <i>square</i>; guess it's worth
five dollars. You owe me twelve; but considering your
circumstances, I'll be satisfied with that."</p>

<p>Long before the conclusion of this speech, Susan had
covered her brooch with her hand, as if his very look were
profanation; and when he finished, she turned towards the
clock, and said hurriedly,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 181 -->

<p>"Take that."</p>

<p>He proceeded to take it down, and after it was safely in
his possession, he told Mrs. Elmer that she must vacate
the house before night, as he had rented it to some one
who would be ready pay. Susan's indignation was roused
at this shameful injustice, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely, you do not mean to turn me out of the house
now, with my helpless mother and little ones. That
clock, too, is fully worth another quarter's rent, and a
good deal more. You will allow me to remain a few
weeks, and meantime I will be looking for another house."</p>

<p>"This clock worth another quarter's rent, hey!" and
he laughed heartily at the idea. "Why, woman, you
know nothing about the value of things, if you did you'd
think I've let you off pretty easy. As for the house,
didn't I tell you I'd let it already to a family that's to take
possession to-morrow. I've done the best I can by you.
Everybody must look to their own interest, you know, and
if I have a chance to let a tenement to better advantage
than I can to you, why of course it's my duty to do it. I
owe it to my own family; scripture, you know, says
everybody must provide for their own."</p>

<p>Susan said no more, she was not accustomed to disputing,
and she allowed the face-grinder to depart without
farther parley. When he reached the door, he turned
back and remarked that "he should expect to find the
premises cleared early in the morning of the following
day." She merely bowed in reply, and he went away, to
her great relief.</p>

<p>But where should she go? No home and no means of
procuring one. It was still early in the day, not more
than ten o'clock. The old woman appeared confused and

<!-- page 182 -->

puzzled at the scene which had just taken place, and asked
some questions, although she did not comprehend anything
of it. Susan brought her a cup of tea and a bit of toast,
sat by her, and answered her questions in a manner that
satisfied her, and before long she fell into a sound sleep.
Susan immediately gave the baby into Mary's charge, told
Johnny to sit quietly beside his grandmother's bed until
her return, put on her bonnet and shawl, and slipped
quietly into the street.</p>

<p>Where should she go? where, where? If Mrs. Lee
were only at home! The thought of writing to her for
aid to enable her to remain in her present abode, crossed
her mind. But it was too late. She must quit to-day.
She looked up the street and then down, undecided which
way to go.</p>

<p>At length her eye fell upon an old, brown, barnish looking
house, standing alone on a slight eminence, a little out
of the town. She knew it was the residence of Mrs. Maddock,
the woman with whom she learned the business of
dressmaking. Now a widow like herself, and poor, too,
but not in want, for she owned the house which she occupied,
and by her own labors, she still pursued her former
occupation, supported herself and two children, something
older than Susan's two eldest. She had also four children
still older, who were all earning their own living at different
trades. Two sons had gone from home, and two
daughters, tailoresses, boarded with their mother and took
in work from the shops.</p>

<p>Thither Susan determined to bend her steps. She had
not seen much of Mrs. Maddock since her marriage, but
she remembered her as a very kind-hearted woman.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she can help me," thought the desolate

<!-- page 183 -->

woman as she pursued her way. "I recollect how kind
she used to be to us apprentice girls. How in pleasant
weather she always sent us out on the grass plot twice a
day to have a romp, and stretch our limbs. She said
our health required it. And what pleasant cooling drinks
she used to make for us in hot days."</p>

<p>Many other little circumstances Susan recalled as she
went along, all of them in Mrs. M.'s favor, and she could
not help feeling that she would do something for her now.
Nor was she mistaken&mdash;Mrs. Maddock had heard of
George Elmer's death, but not of the circumstances of his
family. She listened to Susan's sad story with tears, and
when it was ended, freely offered her a shelter in her own
house.</p>

<p>"There is one good-sized room at liberty, on the ground
floor too, and if you can get along with that, come. We're
poor but we have health, and no helpless ones amongst us."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I never shall be able to pay you."</p>

<p>"Don't borrow any trouble about that, dear. If you
ever should be able to pay me, as I hope you will for your
own sake, why well and good. And if you shouldn't
'twont kill me. I shan't be any poorer for it a hundred
years hence."</p>

<p>"No, indeed you will not," said Susan as grateful tears
fell from her eyes. " 'He that giveth to the poor lendeth
unto the Lord;' and He will surely reward you whether I
ever can or not."</p>

<p>She then arose, saying that she would go and hire a cart
to remove her furniture.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Mrs. M., "and I will run
over and see if Neighbor Grey's team is at liberty to-day,
if it should be it will save you the expense of a cart, for
they have offered me the use of it whenever I wish."</p>

<!-- page 184 -->

<p>So she hastened to Neighbor Grey's, and soon returned
with the pleasing intelligence, that she could have the
team all the afternoon, and David Grey to drive. It was
arranged that immediately after dinner, she would come
down with David and the team. She would have a bed
laid in the wagon, and Mrs. Grant should be removed before
anything else, lest she might be worried by the noise
and confusion.</p>

<p>When Susan returned home, she found things just as
she had left them, and her mother still sleeping. She
prepared their scanty dinner, and soon after they had
eaten it, the old woman awaked. While Susan was
giving her a rather more substantial meal than the rest of
them had enjoyed, she told her of the approaching change
in their circumstances, and at length succeeded in making
her understand that they were going to a new home, much
more comfortable than the present one, where they would
have no stairs to ascend, and where a very nice woman
was living.</p>

<p>She appeared rather pleased with the idea of a change,
and when the kind-looking Mrs. Maddock, and the good-natured
David Grey soon after came in, she was quite
willing to have them and Susan lift her gently from the
bed and carry her out to the wagon. They laid her in an
easy position on the soft bed and pillows which Mrs. Maddock
had arranged, and Susan seated herself beside her on
the bed, holding a parasol to shade her face. Mrs. Maddock
went on the sidewalk carrying the baby, while Mary
and Johnny trotted behind her as merry as birds, shouting
and talking to the baby, who crowed and laughed back to
them. They reached the house before the rest of the
party, who advanced very slowly and carefully. Susan

<!-- page 185 -->

talked cheerfully to her mother, and the old woman seemed
to enjoy the ride very much.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Mrs. Maddock's, Mrs. Grant was
laid upon Mrs. M.'s bed until her own could be prepared.
She appeared rather uneasy at being in a strange house,
and would not suffer Susan to leave her at all. Therefore
Mrs. Maddock kindly offered to go back with the wagon
and superintend the loading up of the furniture. There
was not much, and it was soon transported. The small
piece of carpet was laid down, the bed was set up, and the
old woman was deposited on it, to change no more until
she should lie down in the last resting-place of us all.</p>

<p>As Susan went about, arranging her few articles in the
quiet room, she felt a degree of satisfaction that she had
not known for months. For she was sure that, happen
what might, there was now no danger of her poor mother
and little ones being turned into the street. She was
more cheerful than she had been in a long, long time.
There was a certain hymn which she used to be fond of
singing and George of hearing, and this evening as she
rocked her baby to sleep, she sang it for the first time
since she had heard of her husband's death. It had a
chorus which ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Look up, my soul! be like the lark<br/>

That singing soars afar&mdash;<br/>

There's ne'er a cloud however dark<br/>

But veils a shining star."</p>

<p>When she had laid her baby down and ceased singing,
her mother, who had been lying very quietly for sometime,
said, "Sing it again, child."</p>

<!-- page 186 -->

<p>Surprised and pleased Susan complied, and when ahe
had finished, the old woman said,</p>

<p>"Once more, my child, it sounds so good."</p>

<p>So she sang it a third time, with a tremulous voice and
shedding thankful tears all the while. And when it was
ended, the old mother took up the last words, "shining
star," and murmured them over several times, each time
fainter, until they died away entirely, and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>The children, who were in their little bed, had been
lying awake, listening to their mother, and presently she
heard Mary say in a low voice,</p>

<p>"Johnny, are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, did you hear mother sing?"</p>

<p>"I guess I did, didn't it sound pleasant, Mary?"</p>

<p>"O, it did, it made me think of the angels with shining
wings that live above the clouds."</p>

<p>"So it did me, how funny that we should think of the
same thing!"</p>

<p>"So it was, Johnny, it made me think of father too, did
it you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought about father while I was thinking of
the angels."</p>

<p>"So did I. He used to like to hear mother sing that,
you know."</p>

<p>"Did he? I forget."</p>

<p>"Why yes, Johnny, don't you remember how he used
to say, 'Come, Susey, sing the "shining star"?' "</p>

<p>"O yes, I do remember about it now."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he heard her sing it now!" said the little
girl musingly. And then they went to sleep with their
arms round each other's necks.</p>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p>As Susan sat by her little taper, she thought over these
childish words. She thought too of her mother's pleasure
while she was singing, and of her peaceful falling asleep
afterwards. Then she wondered that she had so long lost
sight of the "shining star," and was glad she had found
it again. It had made them all so happy. And she knelt
down and prayed that her afflictions might soften her heart,
and draw her nearer to God. That she might no longer
look <i>at</i> the cloud, but <i>through</i> it, and ever keep her eye
upon the "shining star" beyond. From this time she
went about her daily round of toilsome duties, resigned,
and even cheerful, and every night she sang the "Shining
Star."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>MRS. ELMER was much more comfortable at Mrs.
Maddock's than she had been before since Mrs.
Lee went away. Her quarters were narrow, it is
true, but there was a shady, pleasant door-yard,
where Mrs. Maddock permitted the children to play whenever
they chose. There they passed several hours when the
weather was fine. And sometimes they had the baby with
them in a little wagon belonging to Jane and Sarah,
Mrs. Maddock's little girls. Meanwhile their mother was
busy within, now at the old woman's bedside, now at her
household work, and now patching and mending for herself
and children.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>Her evenings Susan devoted to sewing for Mrs. Maddock.
By this means she hoped to pay her rent, and she
was therefore surprised when after finishing the first piece,
that good woman proffered her full pay.</p>

<p>"O no, Mrs. Maddock," said Susan, "I wish to pay
the rent of my room in this way."</p>

<p>"Fie! fie! dear," returned Mrs. M., throwing the
money into her lap, "don't speak of that again, if you do
I shall be offended. Don't you know you must have
something coming in to live on? You may just as well
help me about my sewing, as to take it in <i>on your own hook</i>.
I have more calls than I can possibly attend to. And
besides, my eyes are not as strong as they once were. I
can't sew of evenings any more excepting on the plainest
parts, and your help will be a great accommodation to me.
It will enable me to serve all my customers. So if you
will just take hold and lend me a hand whenever you feel
like it, and allow me to pay you what it's worth, I assure
you it will not only be some assistance to you, but 'twill
actually put money in my pocket too."</p>

<p>"Thank you! thank you! Mrs. Maddock. Then I
will do the nicest parts and you the plainest, for my eyes
are perfectly strong and good yet."</p>

<p>"Agreed, that's a nice arrangement. But you mustn't
try your eyes too much and spoil them while you're a
young woman. You shall have one of my lard lamps in
here. I have two, and the girls and I never use but one
at a time. They give a bright light and then they're very
economical. You can burn any kind of grease in them,
and that saves the expense of oil."</p>

<p>Susan thanked her again, and said she hoped there
would come a time when she should be able to repay some

<!-- page 189 -->

of this kindness, and the conversation ended with Mrs.
Maddock's commanding her never again to speak of obligation.</p>

<p>This worthy woman's kindness did not stop here.
Scarcely a day passed without some token of her interest in
the Elmers. A pie or a cake for the children. And often
a bit of fish, an egg, or some other little delicacy for the
old woman. And every morning a pitcher of milk.</p>

<p>"You will at least take pay for the milk," said Susan,
almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"Bless your soul and body, dear woman," Mrs. Maddock
replied, "do you think I shall be any the poorer in
a hundred years for giving you a little milk? I never sell
milk to anybody that's worse off than I am. My cow's a
first-rate animal. I make all my own butter and have
several pots to spare every fall. And when a rich family
wants to buy milk of me, why I take the pay of course.
But as for selling milk to poor folks, I can't do <i>that</i>. My
mother before me never did it, and I never will."</p>

<p>"Your mother must have been very good."</p>

<p>"Good! I never saw the like of her. I didn't know
how good she was when I was a young, giddy girl. It
wasn't so much by what she <i>said</i> as by what she <i>did</i>, that
she showed her goodness. But after she was dead and
gone I began to realize it. And when I was married and
went away, and saw more of the world, then it struck me
how much better my mother was than most of people. And
when my family began to grow up round me, and I had
my own trials and troubles, I remembered how many my
mother had, and how patiently she bore them. O how sorry
I felt that I hadn't been more dutiful and loving to her.
So I tried to do as she used to, for I remembered her actions

<!-- page 190 -->

better than her words. And I've tried to keep them
always before me. But if I should live a hundred and fifty
years I never should come to be what my mother was."</p>

<p>Susan looked at the poor wreck upon the bed, and
thanked God in her heart that she too had been reared by
a good mother, and was now privileged to sustain and care
for her in that state of helplessness.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Mrs. Maddock's unvarying kindness,
there were some circumstances which rendered Susan's situation
rather unpleasant to one of her temperament. The feeling
of dependence which constantly weighed upon her spirit,
was increased by a suspicion that the two older daughters
of Mrs. Maddock were not satisfied with her being there.
They were good-tempered girls, and there was never anything
rude or unkind in their deportment towards herself.
But occasionally a hasty expression to her children escaped
them. And once, as she was passing through the entry,
she heard one of them say to the other,</p>

<p>"I think we have children enough of our own without
keeping other people's. I should think she might put
Mary out." Susan did not blame the girls. She thought
it natural that they should feel so. But it made her very unhappy.
She had not thought of putting Mary out before,
and it wrung her heart. But she felt the necessity of doing
something. If Mrs. Lee were only home. She knew
that she might count upon help from her. She was almost
sure that she would have been glad to take Mary, and <i>that</i>,
she could have borne, for Mary loved Mrs. Lee, and would
no doubt have been happy with her. But she was gone,
and there was no one who knew when she would be back.</p>

<p>While she was in this state of perplexity, an opportunity
offered for getting Mary a place, and she embraced it.

<!-- page 191 -->

Not without many secret tears, still in the hope that the
separation would not be long. The child herself was at
first unwilling to go. She could not bear to leave her
mother and Johnny, and above all the baby. And then
too, Mrs. Smith, with whom she was going to live, was
not a bit like Mrs. Lee. She did not look as pleasant.
If it was Mrs. Lee she would be willing to go and live
always with her.</p>

<p>But her mother talked long and seriously to her.</p>

<p>"You are a little girl, Mary," she said, "but you are
old enough to see that I have to work very hard to get
clothes and food for you all. Mrs. Smith offers to feed
and clothe you, which is very kind. And in return you
are to help take care of her baby, just as you do of your
own little brother. Don't you see that will be helping me
very much?"</p>

<p>When the little girl understood that it would be a relief
to her mother, she became reconciled to the idea of going,
and the next morning, after a great many kisses all round,
and numerous hugs administered to the baby, she set out
for Mrs. Smith's, with a basket on her arm containing her
small wardrobe, and Sarah Maddock to show her the way.</p>

<p>"I don't half like the looks of that Mrs. Smith where
Mary's gone," said Mrs. Maddock to her daughters.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Martha.</p>

<p>"Nor I neither," said Anne. "I should be very sorry
if the little thing wasn't well treated, for she's a good
child."</p>

<p>Both the girls felt some compunction for having wished
her away, and they made amends afterwards by constant
kindness to Johnny and the baby.</p>

<p>The Mrs. Smith with whom Mary had gone to live was

<!-- page 192 -->

the one before mentioned, wife of the man who had made
his fortune in California, no longer "Jonathan Smith the
shoemaker," but "J. Pixley Smith, the leather merchant."
The exact amount of Mr. Smith's acquisitions in California
was not known; but to judge from the change in his outward
circumstances since his return, it must have been
considerable. He was doing business on a pretty large
scale; and Mrs. Smith, from a small, unpainted house,
where she "did her own work," was elevated to a tall, red
brick one, with bright green window blinds, and there,
reigned over a <i>hired girl</i> and also a baby nurse. An extract
from a letter which she wrote about this time to a
sister in Vermont, will give some idea both of the woman
and her mansion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's bilt of brick painted red, three story high, and
very tall chimberly tops, and a suller kitchen in the basement
underneath. The upper story we haint furnished
more than to put shades to the windows to make a show
on the outside, but the first and second stories is complete.
I've got two parlors with folding doors between 'em; the
front parlor is furnished with mahogony chairs and a sofa
cushined with hair cloth, and a looking glass bigg enough
to see the whole of yourself in, and two ottermans, and a
splendid centre-table with a tremenjous bigg astorial lamp
in the middle of it. The mantletry shelf is supported by
marble pillows, and atop of it stands three Jo Randals, the
middle one nearly a yard high, with rising of a hundred
diamond dependants hanging from it. Over the sofa hangs
Mr. Smith's portrait as natural as life, and the windows
has gold cornishes as much as a foot wide, and musling
curtings of the most costliest description. And the carpets
I couldn't describe if I should try forever, they being alike

<!-- page 193 -->

in both parlers, and all covered with magnificent flower
pots bright enough to dazzle common folkses eyes. In
the back parler stands Henrietta's piano; we calculate to
have her learn music; then there's two tater tates, you
know what they are I spose, and chairs and mantletry-shelf
like them in the front parler, on which stands a number of
pappy Mash ornaments, that's very fashionable now. You
never saw any like em, they being intirely new fashined,
and named after the inventor, old Mr. Mash. I shouldn't
wonder if it was the one we used to know, he was always
inventing something you know, and a number more things
of various discriptions. At the lower end I calculate to
have a family picture to hang; it's nearly done now, and
Mr. Boggles is a painting it; you can imagine how superior
it is when I tell you that we shall have to pay twenty-five
dollars for it. It represents the four oldest children a
standing up in a row; Ferdinand stands first with a book
in his hand, Henrietta next with a bokay, Josephine next
a holding her doll, and Columbus last a drumming on his
little drum. On one side sits me a holding the babe, J.
Pixley Junior in my arms. In the folding doors stands one
of these Elizabeth Ann chairs, that's considered so undispensable
in every genteel parler at the present time, with
a high-pinted back and cushined with red velvet, and very
uneasy if a body ever wanted to set down in em, but they
don't. We calculate to have the house heated by a furniss
in the basement next fall, with legislators in the floor to let
the heat go up stairs you know. Stoves ain't considered
genteel any longer only in kitchings. I tell you Ime as
good as anybody now. I've had a number of calls from
ladies that never come near me before; they seem to jest
found out we live in town. Californy gold dust aint like

<!-- page 194 -->

other dust; it seems to open some folkses eyes all of a sudding,
instid of blinding em. I keep a bigg girl that does
the heft of my work, and have to pay her a dollar a week;
and besides her I've got a small one to take care of J. Pixley,
and I get a good deal out of her and it's all clear gain,
for all I pay her is her clothing and vittals, and the clothing
aint much, as I shall make her wear the girls' old
things; the food is something, for such children eat awfully,
but I watch her pretty close; she's only seven year
old but I never saw a child of that age so handy with a
babe. A good deal of the furniture I've discribed, husband
bought to a vandue in New York, very cheap indeed, but
don't you never breathe a sillyble about it to no living creature,
but come as soon as convenient and see how we look
in our new residence."</p>

<p>When little Mary arrived at Mrs. Smith's, Sarah took
her to the basement door and then left her. She knocked
and was told to come in. There was no one in the kitchen
excepting the hired girl, who was washing up the breakfast
things. She was an odd looking girl, almost as dark as a
squaw, with a flat nose and a long chin. She was cross-eyed
too, and her stiff black hair was cropped close to her
head. Mary was almost frightened when she first looked
at her. But when she spoke in a pleasant voice and asked
if "this was the little girl that was to live there," her fears
subsided, and she answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Well then, take off your things and I'll put them up
stairs; you'll sleep with me."</p>

<p>Mary surrendered her bonnet and cape, as well as her
basket to the queer-looking girl, who patted her head and
said, "How nice your hair curls! is it natural?"</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>"Natural?" said the little girl inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I mean do you roll it up in papers, or does it curl
itself?"</p>

<p>"O, it curls itself. I didn't know what you meant at
first."</p>

<p>"Well, that's beautiful. Now I suppose you must go
up stairs to Mrs. Smith's room. No need of my going
with you; right up this stairs and then along the hall, and
into the room where you hear a dreadful hullabaloo."</p>

<p>These directions enabled Mary to find the room without
difficulty. She tapped at the door, but was not heard.
So she opened it and went in. Such was the commotion
inside that her entrance was unnoticed. The two girls
were disputing furiously about Josephine's sun-bonnet,
which she declared Henrietta had hidden. Columbus, a
boy about three years old, was stamping about in an old
pair of his father's boots, and Mrs. Smith, baby in arms,
was standing at the window, knocking and screaming at
Ferdinand, the eldest hope, who was loitering in the street,
instead of going to school.</p>

<p>"You do know where it is, and you know you do," said
Josephine.</p>

<p>"I don't neither, and you know I don't."</p>

<p>"You lie, and you know you lie."</p>

<p>"I don't lie, you lie yourself. Say ma! shan't she give
me up my sun-bonnet? I want to go to school."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether she does or not," shouted Mrs.
Smith turning quickly round. "I'm half crazy with this
everlasting racket; go to school, sun-bonnet or no sun-bonnet."
And she gave them each a hearty box on the
ear and pushed them out of the door, while they retaliated
by calling her a "mean old thing," "old cross-patch," &amp;c.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>As Mrs. Smith opened the door to eject the girls, she
perceived little Mary, who stood trembling behind it.</p>

<p>"O you've come, have you? well, I'll attend to you
soon." She then seized Columbus and shook him violently
with the hand she had at liberty.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you little scamp, clattering round
in them boots! get out of 'em quicker;" and she lifted
him up by the arm so that the boots fell off. The boy
bawled lustily. At this moment Mr. Smith entered the
room, evidently much excited.</p>

<p>"At it again hey?" said he. "You're always abusing
that boy. Lummy, my son, come with pa," taking hold of
his arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith did not relax her gripe on the other arm.
The boy was a constant bone of contention between his
parents.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, "you wouldn't always interfere
when I'm a trying to correct him, Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"And I wish you'd be good enough to let go of his arm,
Mrs. Smith."</p>

<p>As the mother labored under a disadvantage on account
of one arm being occupied with J. Pixley, Junior, she was
in the end compelled to yield, and the affectionate father
led his son off in triumph to the "leather store."</p>

<p>Poor little Mary, to whom such scenes were new, was
nearly frightened out of her wits at it, and felt quite relieved
to find herself alone with Mrs. Smith and the baby.
Mrs. Smith was a tall, poking woman, with a sallow complexion,
and a long, sharp nose. She turned to Mary as
soon as the coast was cleared, and ordered her to go to the
kitchen and tell Jerusha to send her a basin of water, right
from the pump to wash the <i>babe</i>. Mary obeyed, and after

<!-- page 197 -->

sending her to fetch half a dozen more things, Mrs.
Smith was ready to begin the ablution of J. Pixley.</p>

<p>He was a very fat baby, with cheeks hanging down on
his shoulders, and a pointed head, crowned on the summit
with a tuft of stiff, black hair about an inch long, which
stuck up straight in spite of all his mother's efforts with
comb and brush, to make it lie down. Little Mary's first
movement was to run up and stand by Mrs. Smith, as she
always did by her mother when she washed their baby.</p>

<p>"What makes him cry so?" she asked. "Our baby
never does when he's washed."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't wonder if your ma takes the chill
off the water. Some folks don't know any better, but it's
no way. I always wash my children in the coldest water
I can get, and in the summer I put a chunk of ice in it."</p>

<p>Mary no longer wondered that J. Pixley cried, nor that
his skin was so red. She noticed when his mother put on
his clothes, that she pinned his waist bands as tight as she
could possibly draw them, and she concluded that this was
done to push up the flesh and make his cheeks fat.</p>

<p>"How funny his hair looks," remarked the child in the
simplicity of her heart. "It doesn't curl round like our
baby's, his is real pretty; it goes <i>so;</i>" and she described
several half circles with her finger on J. Pixley's head.
Mrs. Smith never forgave her this speech. She glanced
spitefully at the little girl's head, covered with those short
golden rings which are so beautiful in childhood, and which
art cannot imitate, thinking as she did so, of the stiff, mud-colored
locks of her own children, and after a moment she
said,</p>

<p>"So you think curly hair's mighty pretty? Well I don't
agree with you. I'm glad he hasn't got curly hair, nor

<!-- page 198 -->

any of the other children. It looks so niggery. If your
ma expects me to fuss with yours as she does, and keep
it quirled up in that ridiculous way, she's mistaken."</p>

<p>"My mother doesn't fuss with it. She only combs it
out in the morning when I get up," said Mary, in some
alarm, fearing that she had done something wrong.</p>

<p>"You talk too much child," said Mrs. Smith sharply.</p>

<p>When she had finished J. Pixley's toilet, she laid him
in the cradle still screaming, and told her to rock him to
sleep.</p>

<p>"And if he won't go to sleep so&mdash;take him up and
walk with him till he does; do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Mary.</p>

<p>"And then sit down on that stool by the cradle and
sew on this till he wakes up. You can sew some, can't
you? you're old enough anyhow."</p>

<p>Mary answered that she could sew a little on coarse
things, and she took from Mrs. Smith's hand a towel begun
to be hemmed.</p>

<p>"And as soon as he wakes, let me know; do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said the child, and then Mrs. Smith
went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mary rocked the cradle, singing the while a childish
tune. There was something in her voice and manner
soothing to the poor baby after his mother's rough handling,
and he soon ceased crying and fell asleep without
obliging Mary to take him up. And then the little nurse
began her sewing. She felt very sorrowful, as she sat on
the little stool in that strange, disorderly room, and thought
of the angry words she had heard, and the angry faces she
had seen there, and then of her own home where all was so

<!-- page 199 -->

different. It seemed as though she had been a long, long
time away, and she could not prevent a few tears rolling
down her cheeks. But she wiped them hastily off with the
rough towel she was hemming, and said to herself, "I
mustn't do so. I must try to be good and contented, and
help my mother as much I can."</p>

<p>Poor little one! She had entered upon her first real
trials. But we must reserve the account of them for
another chapter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>AT this moment the little girl was startled by a
strange noise under Mrs. Smith's bed, and presently
a large Newfoundland dog emerged,
stretched, shook himself, and looked round. As
soon as he caught sight of the strange child sitting by the
cradle, he showed his teeth, and uttered a low growl.
Poor Mary was dreadfully terrified. What should she
do? If she were to stir or cry out, he might spring at
her and tear her to pieces before any one could come to
her rescue. Therefore she bethought herself to try coaxing.
She remembered to have seen her father once conciliate
a ferocious dog in this manner, when she was out
with him; and so, frightened as she was, she ventured to
speak to him.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! poor old fellow."</p>

<p>The dog relaxed his countenance somewhat, and came a

<!-- page 200 -->

few steps nearer. She spoke again, in a low, sweet
voice.</p>

<p>"Doggy, good doggy, you won't bite a poor little girl,
will you?"</p>

<p>The dog advanced close to her side. She took courage
and patted his back, though her hand trembled a little,
still talking in the same pleasant way, and very soon the
creature sat down and laid his head caressingly on her lap.
Little Mary was greatly relieved, and resumed her sewing.
This animal had a great antipathy to children past the age
of infancy; caused, undoubtedly, by his having been constantly
teased and worried by the little Smiths. He was
the terror of all the urchins in the neighborhood, who
would scamper off whenever they saw him. He was not
accustomed to kind words, and they had a magical effect
upon him, when uttered by Mary's sweet, child-like voice.
So from this time, Bounce and the little girl were the best
of friends.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Smith came in shortly after, she was exceedingly
surprised at the phenomenon which met her eyes.
After her astonishment had in a measure subsided, she inquired
"how that dog came there." Mary answered that
he came from under the bed.</p>

<p>"Well, how came he to be so friendly with you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed," said Mary, "only I thought
he was going to bite me, so I said, 'poor fellow,' and
talked to him, and after awhile he came up to me very
good."</p>

<p>"So you've been coaxing him, hey! Well, I'll let you
know I didn't get you here to play with the dog; here
Bounce, get out, you nasty squadruped;" and she assisted
him with her foot to obey the command.</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p>The commotion awaked the baby, whereupon his
mother took him up, and then ordered Mary to "fly
round and put the room to rights." The child was very
expert at "putting to rights," for she had been taught to
assist her mother in this way, but she never before had
quite so unpromising a field to work upon.</p>

<p>"How can I ever get it to rights?" thought she; "it
is so dreadfully to wrongs." But what with her own ideas
of propriety, and Mrs. Smith's instructions where to place
<i>this</i>, and how to fix <i>that</i>, she did at length succeed in getting
the room into a state something like order; a nearer
approach to it in fact, than had been achieved in a long
time.</p>

<p>"Hereafter," said Mrs. Smith, "I shall expect you to
do this every morning without being told; d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>Mary answered in the affirmative, and then her mistress
told her to <i>bring on</i> her sewing, as she wanted to see
what <i>sort</i> of work she made of it. Mary brought it to
her, and she at once pronounced it "distress-ed," the
stitches, she said, were a foot long&mdash;she wondered that a
<i>great girl</i> like her couldn't sew better, and ordered her to
take more pains in future. Mary said "she could sew
a good deal better when she had a thimble, but she had
not brought hers."</p>

<p>"So you haint fetcht no thimble, hey? Well, it's curious
your ma didn't think of it. Shouldn't wonder if you
hadn't any."</p>

<p>"O, yes ma'am, I've got a nice silver one, that father
gave me on my last birthday before he went away."</p>

<p>"Silver thimble for a young one like you that's all the
while a growing, a bright idee, I must say, for folks in
your situation."</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p>"But mother said when it's outgrown I can give it to
some little girl that's littler yet than I. So I mean to give
it to Hannah Fenno, she's only four, and when she gets
too big for it, she can give it to little Ellen, and after
Ellen, little Maria, that's a baby now can have it, and so
you see it never'll be lost."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! I <i>did not</i> know there was anybody
so green in creation! give away a silver thimble, when
you can't get vittals to eat, nor clothing to cover your
surfisses. But it's a mystery to me that your ma didn't
have you fetch it along."</p>

<p>"I suppose she didn't think you'd want me to sew."</p>

<p>"Didn't, hey? I wonder what she calcilated to have
you do all the time the babe's asleep; hold your hands and
play lady?"</p>

<p>To this question the child made no reply, but she ventured
to ask if she might go home and get her thimble.</p>

<p>"There! jest as I knew 'twould be, ready to jump at
any excuse to trot home. But I'll tell you <i>what</i>, Mary
Elmer, once for all I tell you, and do you listen to me
and remember what I say. I aint a going to have no running
back and forth every day from our house to yourn,
d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"O, no, not every day, of course; but only once in a
while to see the baby, you know," said the little girl timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," responded Mrs. Smith, snappishly. "You
couldn't exist I s'pose, without seeing that elegant curly-headed
cherubim once in a while. And then 'twould be
so interesting to me to have you come back and ding-dong
it into my ears the rest of the time. A wonderful help
you'd be to me in such a case. No, you aint to go home
at all, I give you to understand. D'ye hear?"</p>

<!-- page 203 -->

<p>Mary would have answered, but something came up in
her throat and prevented her. She tried to choke it
down, in vain, and after a moment she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"You great cry-baby," said Mrs. Smith; "I've a
great mind to <i>send</i> you home and let you all starve together,
or go to the poor-house."</p>

<p>These words alarmed the child, and she said hurriedly,
"O, don't send me home, Mrs. Smith, mother cannot
provide for us all. I'll try to be good, I won't cry any
more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith was graciously pleased to be mollified at
these promises, and after giving Mary a lecture touching
her future conduct, dwelling at large on the poor-house
and starvation in case of any act of disobedience, and her
own kindness in being willing to save her from such a
fate, she brought out Josephine's thimble for her to use
until she could have an opportunity to send for her own.
She soon after told her to take the "babe" into the
kitchen for his dinner. Mary obeyed, and Mrs. Smith
followed.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Mrs. Smith passed the greater portion
of her time. She was unaccustomed to servants, and
wholly ignorant of the proper manner of treating them.
She had not the slightest confidence in Jerusha. Not because
she had any reason to doubt the girl's honesty, but
because she regarded all "hired girls" as the natural enemies
of their employers, and ready to take advantage of
every opportunity to defraud them. She therefore kept
up a system of petty espionage over all Jerusha's movements,
both to see that she did not purloin or waste anything,
and to be sure that she was constantly busy, and
not trying to slight or "shirk off" her work.</p>

<!-- page 204 -->

<p>Therefore, whether she had anything to do in the
kitchen or not, she was generally there; for the most part
gossiping with Jerusha, and asking her all sorts of questions
about families where she had lived, which the girl,
like many others when encouraged, was ready enough to
answer.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, Mrs. Smith was visited with an
attack of reserve. A sudden sense of her own greatness
and importance as mistress of the house, came over her,
and she determined to let Jerusha "know her place."
At such times her bearing towards her "drumstic," as she
called her, was <i>dignified</i> in the extreme. She moved
about with a queenly air, and although she continued her
visits to the kitchen as usual, she always brought with her
"Thaddeus of Warsaw" (the only book in the house),
and pretended to read while she kept a good look-out
upon Jerusha. These attacks occurred just after she had
received a call or an invitation from some one whom she
considered <i>genteel</i>, or after a <i>spat</i> with Jerusha, which was
no rare occurrence. Jerusha, who was a shrewd girl, and
knew the difference between a "lady" and "no lady,"
was both provoked and amused at these "genteel fits," as
she called them.</p>

<p>But let us not forget J. Pixley's dinner. This consisted
of a large quantity of mashed potato well buttered, the
soft part of a huge piece of apple-pie, and a bowl of
milk. Mary thought it a "funny" dinner for a baby of
ten months not yet weaned, but she did not dare to say
so.</p>

<p>While she was feeding him the children came in from
school, and a terrible uproar ensued. The girls made
themselves merry for a while in commenting upon little

<!-- page 205 -->

Mary's appearance; particularly her curly golden hair,
which they considered vastly inferior to their own mud-colored
pigtails, and then fell to quarrelling as usual,
while Ferdinand amused himself by jogging her elbow, to
make her spill the baby's food. The poor child was
frightened at the conduct of the great rude boy, and was
just on the point of crying again, when the entrance of
Bounce diverted the young gentleman's attention from her.
The dog had barely time to run up and greet his new
friend with a wag of his tail, when the same tail was
seized by Ferdinand, who began to drag him about the
room by it. Bounce never would bite his master's children,
but he often barked and snarled terribly under their
treatment. At this indignity he sent forth a succession of
yells which alarmed Mary, although she did not blame
him at all. The yelling of the dog, the shouts of Ferdinand,
and the boisterous quarrelling of the two girls, created
a concert such as the quiet little creature had never
heard before.</p>

<p>"Get out o' the house every live soul of you," screamed
Mrs. Smith. "I can't stand this racket, and I won't
stand it." Then seeing that the children did not start,
she seized a broom exclaiming, "If you won't go I'll
make you go," and drove them forth into the back yard,
with orders to stay there till dinner was ready.</p>

<p>And then Jerusha proceeded to set the table. They
ate in the kitchen. The dining-room was only used when
they had company. While Mary was yet feeding the
baby, Mr. Smith returned from his store dragging along
Columbus, who was roaring at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"If ever I take this boy to the store again"&mdash;thus

<!-- page 206 -->

far had Mr. Smith proceeded, when Mrs. Smith broke
in.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's the reason you're forever tormenting
that child. Lummy, my son, what's pa been doing to
you?"</p>

<p>"He's been 'hipping me," blubbered the cherub.</p>

<p>"Whipping you, hey? Mr. Smith, I should like to
know what business you have to whip this boy?"</p>

<p>"I whipped him because he deserved it; he's done
more mischief at the store this morning than his neck's
worth, confound him!"</p>

<p>"Mischief, hey! that's a likely story! come here to ma,
Lummy, darling!"</p>

<p>Columbus obeyed, and took refuge in his mother's lap;
and then turning to his father, said with an air of great
satisfaction,</p>

<p>"E ce, ya ya, I don't tare for you."</p>

<p>Dinner was now ready, and little Mary was not sorry
when Mrs. Smith sent her back in the bedroom with the
baby, to wait until they were through. She was beginning
to feel very hungry, but she thought she would
rather go without her dinner altogether, than to sit down
with the children, to say nothing of their parents. When
at last she was called out to dinner, there was no one there
beside Mrs. Smith, Jerusha, and Columbus, who was still
at the table, being always allowed to sit and stuff himself
as long as he chose. Mrs. Smith took the baby, and motioned
Mary to&mdash;not a seat, but a stand by a very dirty
plate which one of the children had used. Jerusha, who
had dined (she always ate with the family excepting when
they had company), offered to wait upon the little girl,
but Mrs. Smith declined, saying she would attend to her

<!-- page 207 -->

herself. She then put a large potato on her plate, cut it
up in chunks, and sprinkled salt over it. To this she
added a very small piece of meat, and then told Jerusha
to take off the dishes. In obeying this order, the girl, as
she took up the bread plate to take it away, offered it to
Mary. Mrs. Smith pushed it quickly from her, saying,</p>

<p>"She don't need bread with her potato."</p>

<p>Mary did want a piece of bread, but she dared not to
say so. There was a small piece of pie left on Jerusha's
plate. To tell the truth she had reserved it on purpose
for little Mary. She handed the plate to her, saying as
she did so, "Would you like this bit of pie?"</p>

<p>Mary thanked her, but before she had time to take it
Mrs S. said with much excitement,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Columbus may want that."</p>

<p>"He's got more on his plate now than he can manage,
and he's as full as a tick already," said Jerusha. "And
besides it's a piece I saved a purpose for her," and she
slipped it off on Mary's plate.</p>

<p>"Jerusha!" said Mrs. Smith, turning very red with
anger. "When I said I'd attend to her myself, I meant
so. And I wish you'd mind your own business, and not
go to loading down her plate and stuffing her with vittals
you haint any right to."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to stuff her," replied Jerusha, "I
thought there was no harm in giving her that little piece of
pie."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that such children will always make
themselves sick overloading if their food aint portioned
out to 'em. It was for her good, of course, that I didn't
want she should have the pie."</p>

<p>"And for Columbus's good too, I s'pose that you

<!-- page 208 -->

wanted he <i>should</i> have it, I don't know why 'taint as bad
for him to overload as for Mary."</p>

<p>As soon as Jerusha had delivered this speech, she began
to sing, the way in which she usually terminated the frequent
spats between herself and Mrs. Smith, for whom
she had not the smallest respect.</p>

<p>After this scene, our little Mary was too much frightened
to eat the pie, and taking the baby returned to the bedroom,
(Mrs. S. had not yet learned quite enough of gentility
to call it "the nursery,") Mrs. Smith banged after
her, enraged at not being able to have the <i>last</i> word with
Jerusha. On reaching that apartment she threw herself
down in the rocking-chair, rocked furiously for a few
minutes, then jumped up, took down "Thaddeus of
Warsaw," from a shelf in the closet, and banged back into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Mary had only occasional glimpses
of her, when she came and poked her head in at the door to
see how matters stood there, to administer a warning or
threatening word to the poor little nurse, and then hastened
back to her favorite post. It was a doleful afternoon to
the child. The baby fretted almost constantly. Mary
thought his <i>overloading</i> had something to do with it. It
rained and therefore he could not be taken out in his little
wagon. She tasked all her powers to amuse him. She
talked to him, sang to him, took him to the window and
tried to interest him in the sights outside. But the only
way that she could quiet him at all, was by carrying him
up and down the room.</p>

<p>O how her poor little arms ached! for he was a very
fat, heavy child. Once they gave out entirely, and she was
compelled to drop him into the cradle to rest them. But

<!-- page 209 -->

he screamed so tremendously that it brought his mother
from the kitchen, and she gave Mary a terrible scolding
for "letting him lie there and cry." Mary said she had
only laid him down a little while to rest her arms.</p>

<p>"Time enough for that when he's asleep," said the affectionate
mother, "don't you let me catch you doing so
again."</p>

<p>So Mary took him up and walked with him; up and
down, up and down, until she felt as though her ankles
would break and her arms drop off. At last it occurred
to her how very tightly his mother had pinned his clothes
in the morning, and she thought that after such a dinner as
he had eaten they must be very uncomfortable. She ventured
to examine. They were very tight indeed, she could
hardly get her finger under them. She knew he must be
suffering on that account, and after some hesitation she determined
to loosen them if possible. This was no light
task for her, but she accomplished it after a time. She
carefully extracted the pins. But when she had got them
all out, and begun to put them in again, her fingers
trembled a little, she was so fearful of pricking the baby.</p>

<p>"O baby," she said, "why doesn't your mother have
strings on your clothes, as my mother does on little
Georgey's? I'm so afraid I shall hurt you."</p>

<p>But she did not hurt him. He was much more quiet
while she was <i>undoing</i> and <i>doing him</i> over, and when she
had finished, his cries ceased entirely. Mary had really
done this nice little piece of work as well as any grown
person could, and the child was completely relieved. He
stretched his limbs out to their full extent, and seemed delighted
to be able to do so. Indeed, Mary fancied that he
looked up gratefully in her face, and she felt an interest in

<!-- page 210 -->

the homely little thing, that she had not felt before. She
kissed him, and he tried to return the caress, then laying
his cheek against hers fell asleep in a few moments.</p>

<p>"Dear baby," said Mary as she laid him in his cradle,
"how glad you are to be made comfortable; perhaps you
will get to love me though your mother doesn't, but O
how tired I am!" And throwing herself on the floor at full
length, she stretched out her arms and enjoyed for a few
minutes the luxury of resting.</p>

<p>"I must be careful not to rest too long," she thought,
"or Mrs. Smith will come and be angry with me. I'll
be up directly and go to my sewing." But "directly" she
began to think it was very pleasant to lie so, and then she
had a confused idea of not caring whether Mrs. Smith came
in or not, and then&mdash;she was asleep.</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Smith did not come in during her nap,
which was soon cut short by a great noise under the
window. It was the young Smiths returning from school.
She was at first alarmed to find that she had been asleep,
but was reassured on seeing the baby just as she left him,
and sitting down on her little stool began to sew. She
had just finished one end of the towel when the baby waked,
and she took him into the kitchen for his supper, as Mrs.
Smith had directed. The family were taking tea.</p>

<p>"I was in hopes that young one wouldn't wake till we
got through," said Mrs. Smith, as she began to prepare
his supper, for which he was clamoring loudly. This meal
fully equalled his dinner in quantity, although it differed in
quality; being a bowl of crackers and milk, accompanied
by a large ginger-cake. She placed them on a stand near
the tea-table, where she could keep an eye upon Mary,
and see that she did not "eat it half up herself," and then

<!-- page 211 -->

the little girl sat down, and began the process of stuffing
the infant Pixley.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Smith was looking round to watch Mary,
Columbus, who sat in a high chair near her, reached out
to help himself to something, and in so doing turned over
her tea-cup. She gave him a ringing box on the ear,
called him a "tormented <i>tyke</i>" and was in the act of putting
him down from the table, when his father interposed,
caught him up, chair and all, carried him round and seated
him next to himself, saying it was shameful to cuff a child
for a mere accident.</p>

<p>Columbus, finding himself in security, cast a look of exultation
at his mother, and pouting out his lips informed
her that he didn't tare for her! The three elder children,
who had successively undergone the same process of training
in their earlier childhood, and who gave daily and
hourly evidence of its legitimate effects, applauded the boy's
spirit with such expressions as these: "That's you, Lum!"
"Stand up for your rights!" "Give it to her!" Ferdinand
even went so far as to propose "Three cheers for
Lum!"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was highly delighted at this piece of wit, and
laughed heartily; but Mrs. Smith, not viewing it in the
same light, told Ferdinand to "hold his tongue." This
command the young gentleman obeyed literally, by thrusting
out that member and taking it between his thumb and
finger; at which performance the merriment of the young
ladies became excessive. Mrs. Smith stormed, Mr. Smith
escaped to the store, and the "table broke up in confusion."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith then removed the cakes and apple-sauce
that remained, she kept all such things under lock and key,
and always took care of them herself. Having cleared the

<!-- page 212 -->

table of every thing eatable, excepting one piece of bread
and a little apple-sauce left on her husband's plate, she
plastered the latter on the bread, and placing a cup of
water beside it, took the baby from Mary and told her to
go and eat her supper. Jerusha did not interfere although
she looked round several times as though she wondered
why Mrs. Smith did not go to her own room with the baby,
as she usually did directly after tea, there being nothing on
the table to require her attention. Mrs. Smith, however,
did not take the hint, but remained until Mary had eaten
her small allowance, and then giving her the "babe," sent
her back to the bedroom, where she found that the two
girls had preceded her. They had called Bounce in, and
when Mary entered were adjusting an old shawl over his
back, at which the dog was greatly annoyed.</p>

<p>One corner of the shawl had a hole in it. This they
drew over his tail, and having tied the other two corners
round his neck, pronounced it a first-rate saddle. Bounce
did not submit patiently, but growled and snarled all the
time. The girls, however, knew by experience that his
growling when directed at them meant nothing, and so they
continued to tease him in every possible way, and to laugh
and shout at his vain efforts to disengage himself from the
shawl. Mary felt very sorry for the poor creature.</p>

<p>"O girls, don't plague him so," said she, "see how
bad it makes him feel."</p>

<p>"Who told you to stick in your gab?" said Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Who cares if it does make him feel bad?" said Josephine.</p>

<p>Mary ventured to say that <i>she</i> cared, and again besought
them to take the shawl off.</p>

<p>"Just hear her, Jo," said Henrietta, "what business is
it of hers what <i>we</i> do?"</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p>"Sure enough, the little nasty <i>pot-wrastler</i>," responded
the amiable sister. "Come, Hen, let's set him on to her."</p>

<p>This proposition was received by Hen with great glee.</p>

<p>"Seek her, Bounce, seek her!" she said, clapping her
hands, and pointing at the little girl. The dog turned and
looked at Mary. It was not such a look as that with which
he had greeted her in the morning, but one of supplication.
It seemed to say "Will <i>you</i> not help me? or do you mean
to join my tormentors?"</p>

<p>"Go it, old fellow! seek her!" cried both the girls,
clapping their hands with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>"Poor Bouncey! poor Bouncey!" said Mary, in those
sweet low tones of hers, which had already won him.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard her voice, he ran directly up to her
and licked her face, uttering at the same time a pleading
moan. She immediately went to work to extricate him
from the shawl. A rather difficult task because of the
baby on her lap. But she succeeded after a few moments,
to the great delight of the dog. He jumped about licking
her face and hands, and also bestowing his caresses upon
the baby, whom the sagacious creature had discovered to
be the object of her care, much to the astonishment of Hen
and Jo, who had witnessed the scene in silent wonder.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Smith came in and, seeing Bounce,
demanded angrily "who let that dog in there."

<p>"Mate let him in," said Henrietta without hesitation,
at the same time winking at Josephine.</p>

<p>"O no, no, Mrs. Smith," said Mary. "I didn't let
him in, did I, Josephine?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you did, and you know you did," answered
that unscrupulous young lady.</p>

<p>"And you lie if you say you didn't," chimed in Henrietta.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>"You little hussy"&mdash;began Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>"Now I guess you'll catch it, Mate," said Jo (Mate
was the euphonious nickname which the children had
given her).</p>

<p>"O how can they say I did it?" sobbed the poor child,
as the tears rushed to her eyes; "he was here when I
came in and they were putting the shawl on him."</p>

<p>In her agony she appealed to Bounce himself.</p>

<p>"Don't I tell the truth, Bounce? I didn't let you in,
did I?"</p>

<p>Bounce could only wag his tail in reply, at which the
girls laughed immoderately and said it meant "yes, you
did." Mrs. Smith turned him out, and then catching
Mary by the shoulder, and shaking her almost hard enough
to dislodge J. Pixley from her lap, addressed her thus:</p>

<p>"So you expect me to believe <i>you</i> against both the girls
do you&mdash;you good-for-nothing little hussy! Didn't I
tell you this morning that I wouldn't have that dog in
here? What possest you to let him in&mdash;say?"</p>

<p>Mary could scarcely articulate "I didn't let him in."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me such a lie as that," screamed Mrs. Smith,
giving her another and harder shake, while the girls looked
on with entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>"She didn't let him in, ma," said Columbus, issuing
from his sister's bedroom adjoining, whither he had gone
on a voyage of discovery like his famous namesake.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing in there, you little plague?"
exclaimed both the girls, hoping to prevent his giving any
further information. But Mary too, had caught his
words, and said imploringly,</p>

<p>"You know I didn't let him in, don't you, Lummy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you didn't do it. Hen letted him in,

<!-- page 215 -->

she opened the window and talled him in. Jo talled him
too."</p>

<p>Before this speech was finished the girls had vanished.
Mrs. Smith saw at once that the boy spoke the truth, and
that her daughters had told a lie. But she said nothing
to make amends to the poor child who had suffered so
severely in consequence of it. She commanded Lummy
to "stop his talking," and then saying it was time to
undress the "babe," took him from Mary's arms and told
her to put Columbus in bed. He slept in a crib in the
girls' room. At first he utterly refused to go, and his
mother had just announced her intention to "give it to
him," as soon as she was done with the baby, when Mary
induced him to comply by promising to tell him a pretty
story, which promise she faithfully kept by relating the
wonderful history of "Mother Hubbard and her dog,"
which had such a soothing effect upon Columbus that he
was asleep before it was finished.</p>

<p>When Mary returned, Mrs. Smith was ready to deliver
up J. Pixley to her charge to be walked to sleep. She did
not notice the loosening of his underpinning, which gave
his little nurse the courage to go through with the process
of relieving him thus as often as she found him suffering
from being pinned too tight. She then went to the kitchen
where she had "something to do." This something the
reader will, perhaps, fancy to have been a boxing and
scolding of her girls for the lie they had told her. By
no means. This grievous sin was passed over without a
reprimand&mdash;without even an allusion to it, when every
day she punished her children for faults that were nothing
in comparison with it.</p>

<!-- page 216 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>MARY walked with the baby for some time but he
showed no signs of sleepiness, his afternoon nap
had made him wakeful. He was quiet, however,
and at length she ventured to lay him down
awake, for to say the truth, her arms could hold out no
longer. When Mrs. Smith came back nearly an hour
afterwards, with a candle, she found Mary and the baby
both fast asleep, the latter on her little stool with her head
resting against the cradle for it was long after her ordinary
bed-time. Mrs. Smith was vexed with herself for not
having left a light that Mary might have gone on with her
sewing. She roused her with two or three smart raps on
her back, called her a "lazy thing," and scolded her
roundly for "shirking" in that way when she might have
gone and got a candle and sewed, instead of snoozing away
the time. Mary was too worn and sleepy to comprehend
all that Mrs. Smith said, and rubbing her eyes she asked
if she might go to bed.</p>

<p>"You may as well," returned Mrs. Smith, "for I see
plainly you aint a going to be good for anything in the
evening; come along, you're to sleep with Jerusha."</p>

<p>She led the way up the back stairs, to a desolate looking
garret room, whose unplastered walls admitted many a
ray of star-light ("there was no need of finishing off a
servant's room"). It contained a dirty bed and one old

<!-- page 217 -->

chair. Some nails were stuck round in the beams for
hanging clothes on, and several of them were appropriated
by Jerusha's scanty wardrobe.</p>

<p>Mary's own little basket sat on the floor in one corner,
Jerusha had carried it up. Mary was not a coward, but
she had that dread of strange, lonely sleeping rooms which
is natural to childhood, and she inquired timidly whether
Jerusha would be up soon.</p>

<p>"What, you aint afraid I hope," said Mrs. Smith, "a
great girl like you afraid of the dark! I'm ashamed of
you. Come! be spry, take off your clothes and jump in.
I can't stand here all night waiting for you. Hereafter
you're to come up alone, and without a light."</p>

<p>So the trembling child undressed herself as quickly as
possible, took a night-gown from her basket, hurried it on,
got into bed, and was left alone in the dark uncomfortable
room. She was thoroughly awake now, and despite her
weariness, she could not get asleep. She felt so forlorn
and friendless, alone in the world as it were. She thought
how happy she had been with her mother and little brothers,
and she began to weep bitterly that she must be away
from them, not even permitted to go and see them. She
thought of good Mrs. Maddock, and how she had said to
her as she was coming away, "You must run round very
often to see us." She thought of Mrs. Lee, and a vague
notion crossed her mind that if <i>she</i> had been at home, all
would have been different, she wondered whether she
would ever come back. Then she thought of her dear
father, and wished that she was in the "Good Place,"
with him, where there is no more trouble,&mdash;and that reminded
her that she had not said her prayers. So she
rose on her knees in the bed and repeated them devoutly,

<!-- page 218 -->

Then lying down again she comforted herself with the
thought that if she tried to be good and do right always,
God would take care of her, and in the end all would be
well. With this feeling, she soon dropped asleep.</p>

<p>Not long after, Jerusha came in. She stepped softly
up to the bedside, and holding the stump of a candle
which she carried so as to reveal the face of the sleeper,
she looked at her for a moment. The tears were still
standing on the quiet face, although her last waking
thoughts had left a peaceful expression there.</p>

<p>"What a pretty little creetur!" thought Jerusha. "I
almost hate to wake her, she must be so tired."</p>

<p>She then put down the candle, and touched the child's
forehead lightly, at the same time pronouncing her name.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother! did you call me!" said Mary,
opening her eyes and fixing them wonderingly upon quite a
different face from her mother's.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," Jerusha said gently. "It's
only me&mdash;Jerusha coming to bed."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know now. I thought I heard my mother
calling me."</p>

<p>"I guess you was dreaming about your mother."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was."</p>

<p>"Don't you feel pretty tired?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite tired, the baby is so heavy."</p>

<p>"And some hungry too, aint you? I know I often feel
quite hungry after I've worked hard all day."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do feel rather hungry."

"Well take this, 'taint a good thing to go to bed
hungry." And she drew from her pocket one of the large
ginger-cakes that had been on the table at tea,&mdash;her own
allowance, which had found its way from her plate to her
pocket, while Mrs. Smith waS overhauling Columbus.</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"Thank you, Jerusha," said the little girl with evident
pleasure. "Did Mrs. Smith know you brought it to me?"</p>

<p>"She saw me take it, eat it up, you'll feel the better
for it." So Mary sat up in bed and ate the cake with a
good appetite while Jerusha was undressing. In the fulness
of her gratitude, she said,</p>

<p>"It was very good in you Jerusha to think to bring me
something."</p>

<p>"Law no. I only reckoned you might like a mowful.
I can fetch you something amost every night, but you
needn't say nothing about it, for Ferdinand would make
fun of us for eating in bed you know."</p>

<p>Jerusha had perceived Mary's fear and dread of this
odious boy, and thus availed herself of it to prevent the
child's exposing her. Not on her own account however.
As far as she was concerned, she would not have cared
a straw if Mrs. Smith had found it out, but she feared
bringing trouble upon the little girl who already had
enough to bear.</p>

<p>Jerusha, rough and coarse as she was, had good impulses,
not often drawn out, it is true, in such a life as
hers had been. She was naturally affectionate, but she
had never been treated with affection, in fact she had never
met with real kindness. She was an orphan. Her earliest
recollections were associated with an almshouse from which
she was taken when very young by a farmer's wife who
felt no greater interest in her welfare than did Mrs. Smith
in Mary Elmer's. She was knocked about and treated
with much less kindness than the domestic animals of the
establishment. Compelled also to perform drudgery, both
in and out of doors, which would have been too hard for
even a stout boy. Never spoken to by her mistress in any

<!-- page 220 -->

but a harsh, commanding tone, and on account of her ugly
face and ungainly figure made the constant subject of the
coarse jibes and jests of the men about the farm, who
gave her the name of "handsome Josh," it is no wonder
that Jerusha developed into a very disagreeable, sulky girl.
Many of Mrs. Marsh's visiting acquaintances wondered at
Mrs. Marsh for keeping her, and that lady herself declared
she "only did it out of pity, for she was awfully tried with
the creetur." But it is not our purpose to relate Jerusha's
history at length. Let it suffice to say that when about
fifteen, she contrived to run away, and by dint of begging
along the road, now a meal and now a ride, in the course
of a few days she had travelled more than a hundred miles.
She cared not where she went. Her only wish was to go
far enough to escape forever from Mrs. Marsh. She did
not yet consider herself entirely safe, but being very weary
she determined to stop for a few days at a certain large
town and if possible earn enough to carry her as far as she
wished to go. She presented herself at numerous doors
with the question, "Do you want to hire?" but her appearance
always called forth an unhesitating negative, until
she applied, almost discouraged, to the keeper of a very
large hotel, where servants were always in requisition.
She had so little confidence, and had learned to think herself
such an object of disgust, that she was quite surprised
when the proprietor, after a few questions to ascertain her
capacity, engaged her for a month. When he inquired
what wages she wished, she answered,</p>

<p>"O anything you please; I never worked for wages
and don't know what I ought to have."</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment with some surprise, but
not being over scrupulous about his hired people if they

<!-- page 221 -->

but did their work well, he asked no further questions,
but conducted her into the kitchen where she was soon
hard at work.</p>

<p>Here for a while she experienced the same treatment
that she had always endured elsewhere. She was the butt
of all the servants, both male and female. But she never
answered again. In fact she never spoke at all excepting
as her work required it. She was silent, and always busy.
At length they ceased to annoy her, or to try to penetrate
the mystery which surrounded her, and left her to herself.</p>

<p>That important personage, the "head cook," I should
have said before, had appreciated her from the first. Jerusha's
business was to assist her, and she protested that she
had never before known a young girl so faithful, or one who
would do half as much hard work in a day; without complaining
too. The work was indeed hard, but comparatively
light to the poor girl who had been accustomed to
such arduous tasks as were exacted from her at Farmer
Marsh's. The accounts of her usefulness and industry
rendered by this functionary to the master and mistress of
the establishment, made them very desirous to retain her
after the expiration of the month, and Jerusha would willingly
have stayed now that she had become contented in
her new situation, and found herself giving satisfaction,
had she not a few days previously caught a glimpse of a
man who was a near neighbor and intimate acquaintance
of the Marshes. He was just driving away from the
door as Jerusha came out to draw water, and did not see
her. But she had been very uneasy ever since, and determined
to push on farther as soon as her month was up.
No entreaties could prevail with her to prolong her stay.</p>

<p>Both the proprietor and his wife were extremely urgent,

<!-- page 222 -->

and the cook was still more peremptory. But the girl
continued firm. At length the mistress said with some
asperity, that it did not look altogether right for her to be
so anxious to leave a place with which she appeared to be
satisfied. Jerusha felt hurt that Mrs. Mayhew should
entertain any suspicions of her, and very sorry to bethought
ungrateful to the first persons who had ever treated her
with any consideration. She knew that she had done nothing
wrong in escaping from Mrs. Marsh's tyranny, so she
requested Mrs. Mayhew to step aside with her a little
while and frankly told her painful story.</p>

<p>"O Mrs. Mayhew," she said in conclusion, "do you
think I would willingly leave the first place where I was
ever used like a human being, if I wasn't afraid every minute
of being found out and forced back to that awful place
where I'm bound to stay till I'm eighteen?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayhew saw at once the truth of Jerusha's story
and appreciated her anxiety to be still farther removed from
danger, and she no longer opposed her going. She communicated
it to her husband who agreed with her, and so
Jerusha was permitted to depart in peace, with several
presents from Mrs. Mayhew and more money in the shape
of wages from Mr. Mayhew than she had ever expected to
possess at one time. The head cook was inconsolable and
gave her a new gingham apron, and the other female servants
who had for some time felt compunctions of conscience
for their treatment of a poor girl who evidently had some
sorrow at her heart, came forward and affectionately bade
her good-by, which they accompanied each with some little
keepsake. Mr. Mayhew also kindly advised her as to
her course, and the place which he designated as the one
where she would probably be as much out of danger as

<!-- page 223 -->

anywhere, proved to be our own thriving town. She accordingly
came hither. But we have already gone much
farther into her history than was our original intention and
must rapidly despatch it.</p>

<p>It was not the poor wanderer's good fortune to fall into
the hands of any of those benevolent characters who are
found in every city or village; five years had passed since
she came here, and she had never experienced the treatment
which she met with at the hotel. Wherever she had lived,
her life had been rendered a burden to her by the insults
and jests which were constantly heaped upon her. In
many instances she was defrauded of her wages, and knew
no means of redress. She of course became constantly
more unamiable and surly. She regarded every one as an
enemy, and herself as an object of disgust and hatred to all
the world. Mrs. Smith had hired her because she could
obtain her services at two shillings less by the week than
those of any others to whom she had applied. And now
let us return to the forlorn little garret room where we left
our two girls.</p>

<p>Mary readily promised to say nothing about eating in
bed; "indeed she'd not tell of it and have Jerusha laughed
at by such a naughty boy as Ferdinand." After Jerusha
had lain down, Mary said innocently,</p>

<p>"You don't say your prayers until after you get in bed,
do you?"</p>

<p>Jerusha, not knowing what else to reply, said, "No."</p>

<p>"Well, I always say mine before I lie down when I'm
with my mother; we kneel down, Johnny and I, beside
her and say them. But to-night, what do you think! I
forgot it. I forgot to say my prayers until after I'd been
in bed a great while. Wasn't I wicked? And then I

<!-- page 224 -->

had to say them where I was, for I was afraid to get out
of bed in the dark in this strange place. But I must stop
talking and give you a chance to say yours."</p>

<p>After waiting a few minutes, and perceiving that Jerusha
was silent, she said,</p>

<p>"Do you say your prayers to yourself?"</p>

<p>Jerusha hesitated a moment, and then answered frankly,
but with some petulance,</p>

<p>"No, I don't say any prayers; I never had anybody to
learn me."</p>

<p>"Had you no father or mother?"</p>

<p>"Not as I remember of."</p>

<p>"Who took care of you when you were little?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. I lived in a poor-house."</p>

<p>"Poor-house! dreadful! that's where Mrs. Smith says
I shall go if I don't be good and mind her. It's an awful
place, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not so awful as some places where I've lived since."</p>

<p>"Where have you lived since?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere, and nowhere that anybody ever cared
for me, and so let's go to sleep and not talk any more."</p>

<p>"But I care for you," said the child, putting her arm
round Jerusha. "I care for you, and I'll learn you a
prayer; not my little one, but 'Our Father;' one that's
meant for everybody, big and little, to say; wouldn't you
like to learn it?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can learn it if I try."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can if you say it over after me as I did after
my mother when I learnt it."</p>

<p>And so little Mary began saying the Lord's prayer,
pausing after each petition for Jerusha to repeat it after
her, which the girl did very correctly, and when it was
concluded, Mary said,</p>

<!-- page 225 -->

<p>"O you can learn it very easy. If we repeat it so every
night, after a little while you can say it all alone, and that
will be so nice!"</p>

<p>Then the fair and lovely little one raised her head and
kissed the forlorn, forsaken creature beside her, and a moment
after was sleeping sweetly. The first kiss that had
ever been imprinted upon that distorted face. The effect
was wonderful; Jerusha had from the first moment that
she saw the child felt an unusual interest in her; but now
she knew that there was a bond between them which never
would be broken. And she vowed to herself to protect
the little girl to the utmost of her power. She loved Mary
with the first affection that had ever warmed her icy heart.
Long did she lie awake; new and strange thoughts were
in her mind. She wondered whether she had ever been as
innocent as the child beside her. She was almost sure she
never was. And then she wondered what she should have
been with a mother to guide, and teach, and love her in
childhood, and she pitied from her heart the little creature
who was compelled to be separated from so excellent a
parent as it was evident Mrs. Elmer must be.</p>

<p>"How entirely different she is," thought Jerusha,
"from these Smith children! It's plain enough she's had
quite another sort of bringing up. Poor thing! She'll
have enough to bear here. I'll do all I can for her, but
dear me! that won't be much among such a set."</p>

<p>The next morning as soon as Jerusha was dressed, she
called Mary, and after telling her that she need not hurry
her head off, went down and left her. So the little girl
threw on her clothes, said her prayers and followed.
When she reached the kitchen she found a basin of water
in the sink to wash herself, and a clean, coarse towel; her

<!-- page 226 -->

own towel, Jerusha told her, and no one else should use
it, and she would always find it in one particular spot,
which she showed her. Mary thanked the kind girl, who
then fastened her clothes, and combed her hair neatly.
Not long after, ding, dong, went Mrs. Smith's bell. Mary
obeyed the summons, and going to the bedroom where the
infant J. Pixley was roaring in his cradle, was ordered by
his mother to take him into the kitchen till she got dressed.</p>

<p>But we are not intending to accompany our little heroine
through another day at Mrs. Smith's, for all succeeding
days varied but little from the first. Every day brought
with it the same round of wearying labors, of vexations and
insults from the children, and harshness, nay, even abuse
from Mrs. Smith, and every night the same stolen kindnesses
from Jerusha, who at the end of a week could say,
"Our Father" without any help from her little teacher.
Afterwards they repeated it together.</p>

<p>Susan Elmer was surprised that Mary did not come
home sometimes, and growing anxious about her, went
one day to Mrs. Smith's to see the child. Mary was delighted,
and would have thrown herself into her mother's
arms, but the presence of Mrs. Smith restrained her. The
latter gave so many plausible reasons for not allowing
Mary to go home; such as the fear of its making her discontented,
her extreme anxiety that she should be happy
and contented, &amp;c. &amp;c., that Susan was reluctantly compelled
to acquiesce. Mrs. Smith treated Mary with
unusual kindness in Mrs. Elmer's presence; but a mother's
eye is quick, and Susan saw clearly by the child's countenance
that she was not happy. She told Mrs. Maddock
on her return that she was convinced it was not just the
place for Mary at Mrs. Smith's; but she lived in hope that

<!-- page 227 -->

something would turn up ere long, which would change
the order of affairs. She scarcely acknowledged to herself
that this something for which she looked so ardently, was
the return of Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>In this manner several weeks elapsed, and then a change
took place in little Mary's circumstances, and unfortunately,
not a change for the better. Mrs. Smith's suspicions
had been for some time excited by the rapid
disappearance of certain articles from Jerusha's plate at
tea. At length, by very close watching, she actually saw
the transfer of a buttered rusk and piece of cheese from
plate to pocket. It was indeed the poor girl's own portion.
She was never allowed to take anything twice, and
this piece of self-denial she daily practised to keep her little
favorite from starvation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith said nothing. She pretended not to see,
but she determined to find out "what became of the
victuals." She therefore kept her eye on Jerusha all the
evening, but discovering nothing, she followed stealthily
up stairs soon after the girl went to her room. She bent
her ear close down to a crack round the door, and heard
Mary thank Jerusha for the rusk and inquire whether she
would not like to eat a piece of it herself.</p>

<p>"O no," returned Jerusha, "I don't want any; I
brought it all for you."</p>

<p>This was enough for Mrs. Smith. She opened the door
suddenly, and stood before the two astonished girls, a
perfect picture of rage and malice.</p>

<p>"I've caught ye at last! you nasty, underhanded
snoops. I've long suspected this, and now I'm satisfied.
What business have you to be a stealing victuals to bring
up here and stuff that young one? say!"</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>Jerusha, who was somewhat alarmed at first, had time
to recover her composure during this tirade.</p>

<p>"<i>Stealing</i>, did you say?" she asked, looking the
woman full in the face.</p>

<p>"Yes, stealing; carrying off my victuals unbeknown to
me to feed that young one."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Smith! I never stole a mou'ful of victuals from
you in all my life, and you know I didn't. Whatever I've
brought to Mary I've took from my own share, that you
was willing I should have. I've robbed myself to keep
her from starving, poor little creetur! If <i>that's</i> stealing,
I'll steal again."</p>

<p>"You would, hey? You say that to my face, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, and to any other face of clay you'll bring
on."</p>

<p>"You sassy, impudent trollop! quit the house this
minute, I won't harbor ye no longer."</p>

<p>"Very well, pay me my wages and I'll quit to-night."</p>

<p>"Wages! you're a pretty one to talk about wages!
Not a red cent do you get out o' me after such conduct."</p>

<p>"So you don't mean to pay what you owe me? Mrs.
Smith, I've worked hard and faithfully here for three
months, and you've only paid me for the first month of the
time. I sha'n't leave the house till I get the rest that's due
me."</p>

<p>"Sha'n't, hey?"</p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we'll see who's mistress here."</p>

<p>With these words Mrs. Smith slammed the door furiously
and went down stairs. During this colloquy, little
Mary lay buried under the bed-clothes, trembling from
head to foot. As soon as Mrs. Smith was fairly gone,
she uncovered her head and said in great distress,</p>

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"O, Jerusha, what have you done? What is Mrs.
Smith going to do? What will become of me if you go
away?"</p>

<p>"Don't feel so bad, Mary," said Jerusha, beginning to
undress. "I know well enough what she'll do; she'll be
all over it by morning, and want me to stay."</p>

<p>"O, I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I sha'n't stay, if I get my wages,
and Mr. Smith won't dare to hold onto 'em, if <i>she</i> wants
to ever so much; and I shall clear out in the morning."</p>

<p>"O, how badly you make me feel! There's nobody
here that cares for me but you. Bounce does, but he can't
do much for me. He likes to stay by me, and often
growls at the children when they plague me. I know he
would bite them if they should lay a hand on me; but he
isn't always by when they tease me. Baby loves me, too,
but he isn't like you, Jerusha. O, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Jest so, that's the only reason why I hate to go, you
poor little creetur. But maybe I can do something for
you after I go."</p>

<p>"What can you do then?"</p>

<p>"Why, if can't I do anything else, I can go and tell
your mother all about it, and she'll come and take you
home. But I know she'd like to have you get a good
place where they'd be kind to you; and who knows but
what I can find you such a place?"</p>

<p>"O, if you only could! Some place where they would
let me go and see my mother when I want to, perhaps the
same place where you go. But would Mrs. Smith let me
go?"</p>

<p>"She'd have to I guess, if&mdash;but no matter, let's say
our prayers and go to sleep."</p>

<!-- page 230 -->

<p>After prayers, Mary sobbed out, "O, how lonesome I
shall be, sleeping here alone."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember," said Jerusha, "what you said
to Jo, t'other day, when she was bragging that nobody
<i>saw</i> her take that candy? you said, 'O, Jo, don't you
know that God is everywhere, and sees all we do?' "</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember, and how Jo laughed and made fun of
me. But I'm glad you spoke of it, and I'll try to think
about God watching over me, and the holy angels being
around me every night when I come to bed."</p>

<p>"And I hope it won't be many nights you'll have to
think of it in this place."</p>

<p>And then they went to sleep.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Mrs. Smith reached the kitchen, she found
her husband there, and requested him to "go
straight up stairs and turn Jerusha out of the
house." He asked an explanation. She gave
it; whereupon he called her a fool for making a muss about
it.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he said, "how 'twill work if you
send her off? She'll blaze it all round, and the whole
neighborhood will be up in arms about your <i>starving the
help</i>. And now's the time, you know, for us to be
doing all we can to get into good society: and there's

<!-- page 231 -->

some that's envious of us who'd be glad to make the most
of it. And besides all that, you can't get another girl
that will work so well and so cheap as she does. I advise
you to pass it over, and let things go right on in the
morning as if nothing had happened."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith could but acknowledge that this would be the
wisest course; and after indulging in a terrible out-pouring
against Jerusha, and Mary, too, she concluded to adopt
it. Accordingly in the morning she said nothing to Jerusha
about leaving, nor did the latter speak of it until
Mr. Smith made his appearance, when she immediately
asked him for the money due to her, saying that Mrs.
Smith had told her to quit, and she wished to do so as
soon as possible. Mr. Smith remonstrated, but she was
immovable. Even Mrs. Smith condescended to request
her to remain, and said "she'd got over her feelings."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> haint got over <i>mine</i>" said Jerusha. "I
can't stay another day in a house where I've been treated
as I was last night."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't get any recommend," said Mrs.
Smith.</p>

<p>"I want none from <i>you</i>," replied Jerusha, with contempt.</p>

<p>Smith at length saw that he could do no less than pay
her the money, which he did with a very ill grace, and
under a storm of words from his wife, who protested
"there was no need of his paying a cent," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>When Jerusha had received the money she went to her
room, packed up her few articles in a bundle, and started
off. Smith was standing in the outer door as she passed
through, and said to her, with a look and tone intended
to be very impressive,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 232 -->

<p>"Look here! the less you <i>say</i> the better."</p>

<p>"The better for <i>you</i>, I know it," she answered, with
great unconcern, as she took her way down the yard.
Mr. Smith's emotions at this cool rejoinder, "may be
better imagined than described."</p>

<p>When she reached Mrs. Smith's bedroom window
which looked out upon the side yard, she saw little Mary
standing by it, baby in arms, and she knew that the child
had stationed herself there to see her when she passed, as
her favorite post was by the window next the street.
Mrs. Smith was still in the kitchen, brooding in impotent
rage over her troubles. Mary's eyes were brimful of tears
which she could not suppress, as she stood there waiting
to see the last of her only friend. But Jerusha did not
venture to stop and speak, for she knew that Mr. Smith
was watching her, and feared that it might increase the
little girl's trials if they were to hold any conversation.
So she merely said in passing,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Keep up, you'll hear from me soon."</p>

<p>It was a sultry morning in August, when Jerusha went
forth, as she had often done, before, homeless, friendless,
and not knowing whither to go.</p>

<p>"But first and foremost," she said to herself, as she
slowly pursued her way. "I must see if anything can be
done for Mary. But dear me! where shall I go? I can't
tell who'd be likely to treat her well; I'm sure I've never
lived at any place here where I'd be willing to have her
go, the precious little innocent creetur! Well, if I can't
do anything else, I can go and tell her mother all about
it, and she'll take her right home, better starve there than
at Smith's. If that Mrs. Lee she talks so much about
was only at home, I'd go straight there. She's a good

<!-- page 233 -->

woman, I know, and she would take her away. Who
knows but she has got home? Any how, I can go see.
So she retraced some of her steps, and turning a corner,
went directly to Mrs. Lee's house. As she approached
it, her courage rose on seeing the front windows thrown
open. She went round to the back door and knocked,
but no answer. As she was about to repeat the knock,
Peter Jackson, who was at work in the garden, and had
seen her enter the gate, came round. In answer to her
inquiries, he said that Mrs. Lee would be home that very
evening. She had sent word several days before, and he
had been "<i>given</i> the house a good <i>airen</i>, to be ready for
her."</p>

<p>"O, dear!" exclaimed the disappointed girl; "I'm <i>so</i>
sorry, I want to see her dreadfully."</p>

<p>"Important business with the missus, has the young
'oman got?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very important; but I'll be sure to come in this
evening, rain or shine."</p>

<p>She then pursued her way in search of employment,
and at last offered herself at a large public house, where
she had never applied before. It was a busy time with
them. The court being in session, the house full of
boarders, and servants scarce, she was hired for a fortnight,
and no recommendation required. A hard, rough
place, but she was used to such places.</p>

<p>As soon as Jerusha was out of the house, Mrs. Smith
began to vent her rage upon little Mary, whom she regarded
as the cause of all her troubles. During the process
of washing the baby, she improved the time in pouring
forth a storm of indignation against the child. The
shrill tones of her voice, the incessant screaming of J.

<!-- page 234 -->

Pixley, the consternation of Mary, who was flying about
"setting to rights," altogether made it a "scene for a
painter." When the washing was completed, Mrs. Smith
laid the baby in the cradle, and ordered Mary to finish
hemming that apron, while she was rocking him to
sleep.</p>

<p>"As soon as it's done," she added, "come out in the
kitchen, there's plenty to do there now."</p>

<p>And after dropping the curtain to shade the room,
she went out, and Mary took her station by the cradle.</p>

<p>There she sits, the patient young watcher, rocking the
cradle with her foot, and while she sews, she sings too.</p>

<p class="small">"Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,<br/>

Holy angels guard thy bed,"&mdash;</p>

<p>The baby is very quiet now. His eyes are open still,
but he seems to be in a serene and comfortable state of
mind. At length the lids begin to droop, Mary is watching
them, and her voice falls too. And gradually as they
droop lower and lower, so lower and lower are the tones
of that childish voice, until they fall as gently on the
baby's ear, as the "Heavenly blessings" she sings of, on
his head. And now they die quite away, for the baby is
fairly in Dreamland.</p>

<p>How fast those little fingers move over the hem! It is
morning, and the child is not yet worn but with the day's
labor. Besides, there is a hope in her heart. She is
thinking about Jerusha, and something whispers her that
deliverance is not far off. Hark! she hears a noise, a
very pleasant sound. She pauses in her work a moment
and listens to it. She knows whence it proceeds, for she
hears it almost every day. A young lady who lives

<!-- page 235 -->

opposite teaches a few scholars at her own home, and now
these children are out enjoying their pastime in the yard.
Mary loves to watch them at their play. It is next thing
to being out at play herself. Many a time has she stood
at the window with the baby in her arms, while her feelings
entered warmly into their animated sports. She rises and
steps softly across the room, as softly as she can with those
great clumsy shoes which were not made to <i>fit</i>, but to be
grown into, and furnished from Mr. Smith's shop, who has
plenty of leather on hand of course, but Mrs. Smith "is
not a going to be getting shoes every month for the hussy
to bang out." In fact, she thinks it all nonsense for her
to wear shoes at all, she wouldn't allow it if she didn't suppose
her mother would make a fuss about it, if she should
happen to come in and find her barefooted.</p>

<p>She raises a corner of the curtain and peeps out. How
beautiful everything looks on this soft morning of the waning
summer! especially that door-yard opposite. There
are several fine trees in it, and the little girls are frolicking
so merrily under them! A canary-bird's cage hangs
from one of the branches, and he too, seems blithe and
contented in his little prison. And ever and anon, one of
the number runs up and speaks to him, and he carols joyously
back. And all the time the pleasant-faced young
lady sits by her open window regarding their sports, without
appearing to be the slightest check upon their hilarity.
And our little nurse rejoices too, as all sweet innocent
natures do in seeing others happy.</p>

<p>She stands thus for some minutes, with one hand holding
out the curtain, and her head thrust a little way behind.
Her sewing is in the other hand, and has not advanced any
since she came to the window. She has, however, but an

<!-- page 236 -->

inch or two more to hem, and she is going on with it directly.
She does not intend to look long. But that merry
group is very fascinating. Ah little one! I greatly fear
you will stand gazing until the teacher calls them in, unless
something prevents you. But something <i>will</i> prevent you.
Come away, Mary! come quickly! There is a step in the
passage, a step that bodes you no good, but you are too
absorbed to hear it. The she-wolf is close upon you, haste,
little lamb, to your place by the cradle side, while there is
yet time. She will never know that you have left it. It
is but an innocent fraud, we cannot bear that you should
fall into her hands to-day, when she is so furious. Come
away, little lamb! still heedless! The Good Shepherd
alone can protect you now. Look! she dreams not of
danger, until she feels herself suddenly dragged backwards
by the arm and furiously shaken.</p>

<p>"You miserable, wretched hussy! this is the way you
mind me, is it? this is the way you stick to your sewing
when my back's turned?" (Another terrible shake.) "O
you deceitful little slut! I've a good mind to take your
hide off, you richly deserve it, you viper!" (another and
harder shake; how pale the little one turns! but she does
not speak a word.) "What business have you to be a
looking out of the window? I never gave you leave.
'Twould do me good to pound you within an inch of your
life."</p>

<p>See! she is raising her arm! Hold, woman! you are not
going to strike that defenceless creature! you cannot do it.
Look at that poor little white face! as white as a dead
child's almost, but not so calm. It is the very image of
despair. Look at it! have you no compassion? no bowels
of mercy? O, have you not children of your own?</p>

<!-- page 237 -->

<p>There! the blow has fallen! another! yet another!
God of mercy, stop her!&mdash;Hark! a ring at the door-bell&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, run to the door, and be thankful for getting off
so well."</p>

<p>But the child has sunk on the floor and she does not rise
She is stunned and bruised. She did not even hear the
bell.</p>

<p>"Get along to the door, you stupid thing you," (with a
kick.) "Don't you hear the bell a ringing?"</p>

<p>The child is on her feet now, but how changed! The
bright and hopeful look which we saw on her countenance
but now, is gone; an expression of agony has taken its
place. But beside this, there is something strange, something
never seen there before. The colorless lips are
pressed closely together, and the blue eyes have an unwonted
fire in them. The crushed worm will turn soon.
The little girl has not uttered a sound, but her spirit is
roused, and says within her, "It is enough, I will go to
my mother, I will go this very day if I can but escape."</p>

<p>"Come, make haste for the door! and don't go scuffing
along so; lift up your feet, can't ye? Show 'em into the
front parlor, if it's a lady."</p>

<p>When Mary reached the door, she opened it to a pleasant-looking,
handsomely dressed lady, who inquired for
Mrs. Smith. There was but one thought in Mary's mind
then,&mdash;how to escape, instead of answering immediately,
she laid her hand on the lady's arm, and looked up into her
face with a strange pleading expression, that surprised her
not a little. But she did not speak. After a minute or
two, the lady said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you not understand me,my child? Is Mrs. Smith
at home?"</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>Then the little girl recovered herself, and was frightened
that she had dared to be so free with a stranger, and she
answered quickly, and led the lady to the parlor.</p>

<p>When she announced to Mrs. Smith the name of Mrs.
Bennet Squires, the former experienced no slight degree
of elation at the honor of a visit from so distinguished a
personage, for Mrs. Bennet Squires was, in fact, the leader
of the <i>ton</i> in our town.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she exclaimed, "so she's condescended
to call at last. Well, I'll let her know I'm as good as she
is, any how."</p>

<p>So she hastened to change her dress for a flaring plaid
silk, stuck on her false front, with a very elaborate, untasteful
cap above it. She had plenty of her own hair,
but it was beginning to turn gray which she considered a
great disfigurement, and always concealed on important
occasions, either with an ugly dye, or a still uglier false
front and cap. She also put on her California jewelry;
an audacious pair of earrings, a watch and cable chain,
with a pencil case and half a dozen silly looking ornaments
besides dangling to it, several clumsy finger rings, and an
enormous pin&mdash;full of red, blue and green stones. She
was delighted with an opportunity of showing off these
fine things as well as the splendor of her parlors to one of
the "upper crust."</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires meantime was entertaining herself with a
survey of the parlor decorations. She was a woman of
correct taste, and a strong sense of the ridiculous, and
of course could not but be highly amused at the appearance
of this parvenu establishment. The huge pyramids
of brass and glass which glittered on the mantel, the
gaudy cornices, and other tinsel articles, she protested

<!-- page 239 -->

made her eyes ache for a whole week afterwards; while
the stiff arrangement of the furniture, about the sides
of the rooms, looking as if it did not feel at home in the
least, gave her a very uncomfortable feeling, and a strong
desire to relieve it from its uneasy position. But the
"family picture" astonished her more than anything else.
She had travelled and visited many galleries of paintings,
but had never seen a <i>work of art</i> that would in any degree
compare with it. Her ecstasy was so great that she could
not help indulging in a hearty laugh all by herself.</p>

<p>When her amazement at the grandeur which surrounded
her had in a measure subsided, the pale, pleading face
of the little girl returned to her recollection. There was
an expression about it that impressed her greatly, and she
knew that there must be something in the child's present
circumstances which had caused her singular manner when
she spoke to her, and she regretted that she had not said
more to her.</p>

<p>The entrance of Mrs. Smith interrupted these reflections.
She advanced towards Mrs. Squires with an air
of perfect self-satisfaction, and much rustling of silk.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you," she said, seizing Mrs.
Squires's hand and shaking it up and down like a wood-chopper.
"You've been so long a coming that I begun
to think you didn't mean to call at all. Set down in the
rocking-chair, do."</p>

<p>"I thank you, my seat is very good."</p>

<p>And so Mrs. Smith dumped herself down into the rocking-chair,
and immediately began to rock back and forth,
in a manner characteristic of nervousness and vulgarity
combined. "Won't you take off your things?" and
"how's Mr. Squires?" exclaimed Mrs. Smith, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Squires is very well, I thank you."</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it, health is such a blessin',
feel to envy well folks, since I'm gitting so delikit."</p>

<p>"I noticed a beautiful little flower near the gate in you
yard, Mrs. Smith, is it an annual?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that's the name of it or not,
never troubled myself to know what it was; you see my
nurse girl had some seeds, and my little boy asked me to
let her plant 'em somewhere, so I told her to stick 'em
down there; but I aint no great hand for flowers any
way; but my husband has a great deal of taste in the fine
arts, and so have I, and our family pictur is a satisfaction
to us both. I sejested the suppositions myself, and if the
cost of a thing is any criturion, I am sure it ought to be
good, for Mr. Smith had to pay thirty dollars for it; for
my part I don't begrudge the money, more don't he; law
what's thirty dollars to him?"</p>

<p>Thus she went on, rocking and talking, until Mrs.
Squires who had come in on an errand, felt impatient for
an opportunity to say what she wished and be gone. At
length she ventured during, a momentary pause in Mrs.
Smith's volubility to take out a paper and pencil, hoping
thus to attract her attention.</p>

<p>The latter, however, was only the more gratified, as she
took it for granted that Mrs. Squires intended copying the
family picture.</p>

<p>"I heard you drawed beautiful and I like to have folks
see the pictur, that knows how to appreciate it."</p>

<p>"The effect is very striking," observed Mrs. Squires,
"and such a painting is certainly quite an addition to a
room, but of course, the greatest value of a picture is the
faithfulness with which it preserves the likeness of a friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very gratifying to have a real good picture."</p>

<!-- page 241 -->

<p>"Time adds to the value of these little mementoes, when
God has taken our friends forever from us," said Mrs.
Squires, sadly as she placed her hand instinctively upon a
little miniature of her own dear mother, who had died but
recently.</p>

<p>"That's so," said Mrs. Smith, "but then fashions
change so fast, and I never could endure an old-fashioned
picture, I've got a paintin' of my mother for instance, it's
a real pretty face, but dear me, the hair is stuck up so
high on on her head, and such an old-fashioned mankiller, I
always keep it in the back chamber. If Professor Boggles
will just put a new-fashioned cap and Barskeen on it, I
will hang it in the back parlor, for they say it's all the
fashion to have your parients' picturs in your best rooms
now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires had always tried to show the respect of
civility to opinions not in harmony with her own; but fearing
that she might be tempted to violate her rule, if the
conversation continued, she determined to make the object
of her call apparent and to terminate it as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Making a courageous effort for this purpose she said,
"I called, Mrs. Smith, to ask you to contribute something
toward getting new lamps for the church. You know that
our lamps are getting shabby, and many of them are
broken."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith's countenance fell, her voice seemed suddenly
to lose its utterance, her heart sank within her and
her rocking-chair which had kept time by rapid or slow
vibration to the energetic or moderate demonstrations of
its occupant, came to an unwonted stop.</p>

<p>"After all she haint come for a reglar call only a begging,

<!-- page 242 -->

and I've a good mind not to give her a single cent,"
thought Mrs. Smith, "but then she'll see I haint got no
money to command," and she continued aloud. "Oh,
yes, certainly, I'm glad somebody has got public spirrit
enough to attend to them lamps; it's high time somebody
took hold, but you've happened to ketch me at an unfortinate
time. You see I dismissed my drumestic this morning,
quite onexpected, and after Mr. Smith had gone to
the store, and so I was obleeged to pay her out of my
private purse, and it pretty near cleaned it out,&mdash;and Mr.
Smith not being in you know,&mdash;I haint got it replenished.
But when he comes home to dinner, I'll get a supply and
send some round to you."</p>

<p>As this speech was all a falsehood, it was no wonder
that Mrs. Smith hesitated somewhat in delivering it, and
Mrs. Squires, who understood it to be such, was disgusted
as well as amused. She, however, thanked her for the
promised aid, and handed her the paper, to put down her
name and the amount she would give.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith looked over the names, and noticing that
two dollars was the largest sum given by any one, she
placed that amount opposite her own name in very large
figures and handed the paper back with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"I'll send it round by my nurse girl, this afternoon,"
she said, as if to impress upon Mrs. Squires the fact that
she kept a girl to take the care of her child.</p>

<p>"By the way, was it your nurse girl who came to the
door?"</p>

<p>"It was so."</p>

<p>"She is a beautiful child, and very young, I should
think to have the care of an infant."</p>

<p>"I guess there aint no danger of her hurting herself,"

<!-- page 243 -->

said Mrs. Smith, somewhat annoyed by the lady's expression
of interest. "She's a complete little shirk, I only
keep her out of charity, they are so awfully poor."</p>

<p>"Whose child is she?"</p>

<p>"Well her father's name was Elmer, he went to Calaforny
and died there and left his family dreadful destitute."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Mrs. Squires, "then she is Susan
Grant's child. I had no idea they were so reduced.
Susan was a very good girl."</p>

<p>"But poor and proud, too proud to let her sittiwation
be known, but I happened to find it out almost by accident,
and so I took this young one off her hands; but I
don't know whether I can ever make anything of her or
not,&mdash;can't trust her a minnit when I aint by to watch her,
she spends half her time a lookin' out the winder when the
babe's asleep, instid of sticking to her sewing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires made no reply, but soon took her leave
with a feeling of sorrow for the poor little child, which
Mrs. Smith's unkind words had failed to diminish, and as
she continued her labors, the pale, sad face of the little
girl arose often to her recollection, and she determined to
do what she could to rescue her from a position which she
felt must be full of misery.</p>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the sinking of hopes and the rising of fears, which
the progress of Mrs. Squires' call had developed,
Mrs. Smith's amiability had in no way increased,
and as Mrs. Squires had not even invited her to
"return the call" as she bade her a coldly polite good
afternoon, Mrs. Smith said to herself "I am almost sorry
I signed the paper at all, but it's too late now."</p>

<p>The baby had awaked during the call, and little Mary's
hands being now literally "full," Mrs. Smith was compelled
to prepare dinner alone, but she had only succeeded
in replacing her finery in the clothes press when Mr. Smith
and the children came in, and the disorder and confusion
became more intolerable than ever.</p>

<p>At length dinner was placed on the table, and when the
more clamorous demands of the children were silenced as
Smith said by "letting their victuals stop their mouths,"
the subject of Mrs. Squires' call was mentioned.</p>

<p>"I think it's high time some of them sort of folks begun
to take a little notice of us; we have paid a big house rent
about long enough for nothing."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't be in any hurry to return the call. I guess
I'm as good as anybody."</p>

<p>"Hadn't better be too particular; it's to my interest to
get in with them sort of folks."</p>

<p>"Yes, and be dunned for a subscription every day of

<!-- page 245 -->

your life. That's one thing she wanted this very day; all
the upper crust are signing round to get new lamps for the
meeting-house, and so she wanted to see how much she
could get away from us. But she's a polite beggar I must
say, for she didn't come right out on the start; but it's all
the same if they only get the money."</p>

<p>"That's so, and it's very obliging to offer to spend
your money for you, but I hope you let her see you could
give as much as any of 'em; folks can't be popular without
its costing anything. I often see men signing ever so
much for foreign missions and such like things, when I
know they are distressed to death with their grocery bills;
but here's the money, and you had better send Mary right
over with it. You see it won't be any less for waiting, and
then it will show her that we are prompt and on hand
about the matter."</p>

<p>"Don't be in such a desperate hurry; I guess Mary
can wash up the dishes before she goes."</p>

<p>The meal was finished; Mary went about her task,
baby was unusually quiet and amiable, amusing himself
with some green apples which had rolled on the floor from
Ferdinand's pocket, and which he stoutly maintained a
schoolboy had given him, while his mother as firmly declared
that they came of her "don't-seek-no-farther tree
and she knew they did."</p>

<p>Mary applied herself to her task with renewed energy.
There was a calmness and determination in her manner
in which one of greater penetration than Mrs. Smith might
have read a sense of despotism and a disposition to resistance,
for she had felt the spirit of insurrection rising in her
heart, which already beat with accelerated pulse at the
thought of escape from thraldom.</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>But Mrs. Smith only congratulated herself that Mary
knew she had got the work to do, and as she had told her
"the quicker it was done the better," she innocently
thought Mary was fulfilling her own instructions. Very
different, however, were the thoughts which occupied the
mind of our little heroine. "It is not right for Mrs.
Smith to treat me so, and if mamma knew about it she
would not have me stay here another day. It will not be
disobeying her if I go home," and the child was glad that
the errand to Mrs. Squires gave her an opportunity of getting
started on her way, and when, after her bonnet and
shawl were on and she ready for a start, Mrs. Smith said,
"Now take that money and go straight to Squareses,
and then come straight home, and don't let the grass grow
under your feet," Mary answered, with a calmness which
quite surprised her mistress,</p>

<p>"I shall go and see my mother first." Mrs. Smith
would have forbidden this rebellious act but she remembered
that the very day before a little boy had brought an
urgent request that Mary might be allowed to come home
to see her grandmother.</p>

<p>Amid the contending thoughts which had occupied Mrs.
Smith's mind she had quite forgotten the request, and now
when it arose to her recollection, instead of sending any
apology to Mrs. Elmer, she only said,</p>

<p>"Well, go along, gad-about, you will be a small loss
here; after you have got starved out, maybe you will understand
what I am trying to do for you; but mind you
leave the money to Squareses, and just tell her I sent it,
and don't make a little tattler of yourself, for tattling is
awful mean, do ye hear?"</p>

<p>Mary was soon started on her journey. She was met

<!-- page 247 -->

at Mrs. Squires' door by that lady, who was now ready to
resume her morning's labors. She asked the child pleasantly
to come in, but Mary was too anxious to reach her
own home to stop long on the way, although the tidy sitting-room
looked very inviting. A great many questions
suggested themselves to the lady's mind, but she determined
not to direct the child's attention to the unpleasantness
of her present condition, until she could decide on
some way of improving it.</p>

<p>On learning that Mary was on her way home, Mrs.
Squires prepared a little basket of cakes and fruit for the
family, and as she walked along with her, learned what she
could of them, and asked her to call again at her house.</p>

<p>"O yes, ma'am, I will come and bring back the basket."</p>

<p>This was just what Mrs. Squires wanted, although she
had not mentioned that the basket was not included in the
little gift, but the child's bringing it back would, she hoped,
give her further opportunity of learning the needs of her
old acquaintance, and of furnishing to her assistance in an
unobtrusive and acceptable manner. She felt greatly inclined
to go home with the child that very day, but Mrs.
Squires was not in the habit of acting upon new impulses,
and her time had already been appropriated to the church
business; therefore on bidding the little girl good-by, she
gave her maiden name for her mother with messages of
kind regard, and a promise to call very soon to see her.</p>

<p>The remembrance of Mrs. Squires' kindness made the
child continue her walk with a quicker step and a lighter
heart. She thought how pleased grandma would be with
a nice baked apple, and how Georgy would crow and
laugh over his cookey, and mamma would have no excuse
for not taking one, as there were enough to go around she
was very sure.</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>But as she reached her home she was greatly surprised,
and wondered what was going on. A bedstead was leaning
against the end of the house, while quilts and pillows
were airing upon a clothes-line. A boy was holding
some horses near the gate, while two or three grave-looking
men were engaged in a quiet consultation near the
door. She had begun to fear that mamma had got to
move again, but felt reassured when David Gray spoke
kindly to her, and before she had fairly reached the door,
Johnnie came running out, saying, "Why did not you
come last night, Mary, when we sent for you? grandma
was almost gone then, and we all wished you was here."</p>

<p>As Mary passed into the house, there was not one familiar
face to greet her. A coffin covered with a black pall
rested upon the table in the front corner of the room.
A small bouquet of violets stood on the stand in an old-fashioned
wine-glass, while two grave-looking women
were engaged on a mourning dress. The little girl paused
a few moments to gaze in silent reverence on that venerable
face which, though the animation of life had forever
fled, yet seemed already touched with that triumphant
brightness which betokens the dawn of immortality, she
pressed her lips silently to that aged brow, and then as
quietly passed up stairs to her mother's room. Mrs.
Elmer was seated in her accustomed sewing-chair beside
the little table, with her child in her arms, and although
he had been asleep some time she did not lay him down,
but pressed him more closely to her heart as she thought
how few were left to claim her love or demand her care.</p>

<p>The little fellow, quite unconscious of the sorrow which
had deprived him of his usual lullaby, had asked for the
"shining star," but his mamma could not sing it for him

<!-- page 249 -->

to-night, indeed she could scarcely see beyond the cloud
of desolation and sorrow which oppressed her; yet she
did not despair, for in the many trials of her faith, which
had led her pathway through thorns and sorrows, she still
cherished that "hope" which is "the companion given
the unfortunate by pitying Heaven," and her trusting heart
always found some object for gratitude or praise. And
even now, she was grateful that she had been able to
make her mother's last days comfortable; and that as her
willing spirit had bent affectionately to her filial task, it
had not been hindered by the weakness of the flesh.</p>

<p>She wondered if she could have done anything more for
her mother during the long, weary illness, and then she
looked hopefully to that blessed place of rest, where trials
and changes come no more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elmer clasped her daughter's hand with a faint
smile of welcome, and held it long in silence; and though
few words were spoken, each felt how strong was the bond
of affection and sympathy which united them.</p>

<p>Little Johnnie soon came bringing up the little basket
of apples.</p>

<p>"Aint these real beauties?" said he, as he selected the
fairest for his mother. "And just see what lots of
cakes."</p>

<p>"Put them on a plate, Johnnie, and offer some to the
ladies down stairs," said Mrs. Elmer.</p>

<p>Johnnie hastened to obey the instructions, and soon returned
saying, "Oh, there's the funniest-looking girl
down-stairs, and she wants to see you, to tell you about
Mary, she said."</p>

<p>"I think it's Jerusha," said Mary, starting quickly to
meet her faithful friend.</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>Whatever might have been the enthusiasm of the meeting
between the two girls, out of that house of bondage,
in other circumstances, there was none now.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you got away from there," said Jerusha.
"You see I did not know you had come, and so I thought
I would stop and tell your mother about matters and
things. I've been to Mrs. Lee's, and the colored man
says she is expected home to-night, but I must hurry
along, for I have hired to the Eagle Tavern for a fortnight;
so good-by, Mary," and the poor homeless creature
started back to fulfil the duties of her new engagement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddock, who had been very much occupied in
assisting to prepare Mrs. Grant for her last repose, had
gone to her own rooms to discharge the domestic
duties of her household; but as soon as she learned that
Mary had come, she came in with Martha and Ann, to
welcome her home again.</p>

<p>The funeral was appointed for the next afternoon, and
passed off so quietly, that many living very near, and in
the same street, had not even heard of a death in the
neighborhood. Mrs. Lee had not been able to reach her
home as soon as she had anticipated, and arrived only at
the hour appointed for the funeral.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires had heard of it through the clergyman,
of whom she had made inquiries after the family, and had
taken some pains to inform those whom she thought might
remember Susan Grant and her mother in better days.</p>

<p>Still it was only a small, quiet funeral. Mrs. Lee had
kindly sent her carriage and some money for the sexton's
fee; although too much overcome by her journey and
grief at the loss of her only sister, to leave her own room.

<!-- page 251 -->

David Grey had engaged the hearse and the bearers, and
his own wagon with the carriages of Mrs. Lee and Mrs.
Squires, formed the little procession. Yet in her heart,
Susan Elmer was thankful to give her mother so respectable
a burial; and when the poor old woman had been so
feeble, and helpless, and troublesome, that some had said,
"It was strange God's providence did not remove her,"
the devoted daughter had toiled, and waited, and prayed,
that her mother's life might be spared until something
should occur to enable her to show her mother the respect
of a proper sepulture; and her trials had never yet found
the limit of her faith and patience; for even when the
aged mother's words had become almost inarticulate, their
last utterances were of hope and encouragement, and she
had even tried to join in the chorus of the shining star,
when her faculties showed many sad symptoms of decaying
nature.</p>

<p>When the few who had come to attend the funeral had
again dispersed, and the little family were once more
alone, Susan's mind wandered to the little band in Paradise.
That beautiful portion of Psalms, which the Rev.
Mr. Bingham had chosen as the text for his hopeful discourse
on the resurrection of the just, came again and
again to her mind, with new significance, as she repeated,
"My heart and my flesh faileth, but God is the strength
of my heart, and my portion forever." And as she remembered
how her mother had by faith and prayer, and
works of charity and love, made God her portion on
earth, she trusted that he would now strengthen and restore
the weak spirit, so long bowed by the infirmities of
the flesh. Then she thought of her dear father, who had

<!-- page 252 -->

long ago passed from the earth, and how blest and happy
they would be to be separated no more forever.</p>

<p>And in the midst of her loneliness and sorrow came a
gleam of joy, that those who are united on earth, in that
holy bond which God has blest, can be separated only by
Death, and that even his power is but temporary.</p>

<p>Then she tried to think George would be there, but her
thoughts of him were so much associated with their last
parting, when he had declared that he should be back
again all right in a year or so, that she involuntarily exclaimed,
"What if George should come back just as he
said, alive and well, and rich!"</p>

<p>She had never set her heart upon riches, even when her
husband's prospects for success had seemed fairest, and
she had watched with solicitude his disappointment and depression
at the failure of his cherished plans, while her
heart turned more and more to the treasures which are
incorruptible and fade not away. She had often made
the humble prayer of Agar her own, and though poverty
and sickness had been suffered to remain very near
her, she had never denied her Lord or been tempted to
steal, and take the name of her God in vain.</p>

<p>The children nestled more closely beside their mother,
as the shades of evening closed around; and as the little
group united in the supplicating petitions of, "Our
Father who art in heaven," Susan's heart found a new
cause for gratitude, that little Mary's voice again mingled
with the rest. The little ones were soon lost in the calm
sleep of infancy; but Susan Elmer was unusually wakeful
that night, and her mind still turned to those she had
loved and lost; and remembering how her mother had encouraged

<!-- page 253 -->

Mary's prayers for her father, even when Smith
had declared him to be dead, her last waking thoughts
were a prayer "that God would be with and protect them
till the great day of his final coming."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

</div>

<p>THE cares, the fatigues, and anxieties of the last
few weeks, had worn upon Mrs. Elmer more
than she had been aware of, and she slept much
later than usual the next morning, and when she
arose and tried to discharge her household duties, a
strange and ill-defined presence seemed to linger about
her. A something which she could neither throw off nor
account for, and when in the afternoon Mrs. Maddock
came in with her sewing to beguile the loneliness, she ventured
to tell her of a strange dream which had often visited
her pillow. She had spoken of it once, she said, to
her mother, but as neither of them were superstitious believers
in signs and omens, the subject had soon been
dismissed from their conversation; but now as it had again
returned to her, she confessed she could not wholly dispel
its influence from her mind, nor could she wantonly stifle
the faint hope born of that dream, even though it possessed
no apparent foundation in probability; and she felt
inclined to relate to Mrs. Maddock, "That she had so
many times dreamed of seeing her husband, always in a

<!-- page 254 -->

strange place, and sometimes sick and in bed, and sometimes
engaged in one or another of the occupations which
he had followed before leaving home; and that on every
occasion he had failed to recognize her, or only spoken
with the indifference of a stranger."</p>

<p>"That dream is as plain as day to me," replied Mrs.
Maddock, "you may mark my word for it, George Elmer is
not dead. I don't believe in witcheries and superstitions,
my mother did not before me; but my mother believed in
some dreams, and so do I. Don't you remember Scripture
tells us that Daniel had understanding in all visions and
dreams? and don't you know how Joseph interpreted
Pharaoh's dreams?</p>

<p>"If you had dreamed of seeing him here, I should say
it was only natural, and could be accounted for on the
ground of your thinking about him so much; but your
dreaming that way so many times, of seeing him in a
strange place, makes me think he aint dead.</p>

<p>"But, Susan, what proof did you ever have that he was
dead? who told you he was?"</p>

<p>"I never heard anything about it from any one but
Smith," replied Susan.</p>

<p>"What, Jonathan Smith the shoemaker!" exclaimed
Mrs. Maddock in evident astonishment, "I don't mean to
say that it necessarily ruins a man's veracity to make shoes
for a living, but mercy on us! I should sooner think of
believing a dream, than of taking <i>his</i> word any time. I
should not be a bit surprised if you heard from George
right off.</p>

<p>"My Uncle William Barber went to the Patriot war,
and was gone for years and years, everybody gave him up
for dead; but Aunt Lavina always said he would come

<!-- page 255 -->

back, she knew it just by a dream; and sure enough he
did come back, after serving ten years at Van Dieman's
Land. Every body was as much astonished as if one had
arose from the dead, except Aunt Lavina; she went round
smiling and smoothing out her cap-strings and saying, 'I
told you so!' I don't want to raise any expectations that
aint to be realized, but you may depend upon it, George
Elmer is alive."</p>

<p>Martha and Ann Maddock came in during the evening,
and each expressed satisfaction and pleasure that Mary was
safe home again. "I hope you will never have her go
back again," said Martha, "if I had known how shabbily
she was treated, I'm sure I would have gone after her myself."</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to keep the children together,"
replied Mrs. Elmer, "but everything is so dear in the
market, and we have not any garden you know."</p>

<p>"But," continued Martha, "it won't take a single hod
more of coal if she stays at home, than if she goes, and as
for vegetables, we always get our winter supply of Uncle
James; and I know mother will engage some from him for
you. We do all the sewing for him and the boys, and of
course it don't come so high as if they went to the shop
with their work, and then they bring us good measure of
apples and vegetables."</p>

<p>It was all satisfactorily arranged. Ann suggested that
Mary could sometimes go down to the village for thread
and needles for them, besides holding the skeins of silk,
and both the girls felt a gratification in trying to make
amends for their former hastiness to the child.</p>

<p>As the fall sewing came in, and the hope of keeping her
little family together and supporting them comfortably

<!-- page 256 -->

seemed about to be realized, Susan applied herself to her
daily tasks with renewed energy; and as Mrs. Maddock
and her daughters, by their continued kindness, did all they
could to diminish Mrs. Elmer's sense of obligation, a feeling
of cheerful contentment, almost akin to happiness, once
more stole over her.</p>

<p>True their daily needs required her constant labor; their
clothing was of the plainest material, and their table offered
none of those delicacies which are counted by so many as
necessaries. There were few to sympathize with her loneliness,
and she might have been less happy had not necessity
compelled her to be always caring for the comfort of
those dependent upon her.</p>

<p>It had been many months since Susan had thought of
rest or recreation; but one bright Saturday afternoon in
October, her work for the week being completed, Susan
proposed to the children a walk to the village graveyard,
and a visit to grandma's grave.</p>

<p>The little ones were greatly delighted with the plan, and
were soon ready for a start. Georgie was carefully tucked
up in Mrs. Maddock's little wagon, and Johnnie and Mary
volunteered to draw him all the way, but they began to
show signs of weariness before reaching the top of the hill
where the burial ground was situated, and as their mamma
relieved them from the task, they soon began amusing
themselves by gathering the bright autumn leaves now
gently falling upon the shaded pathway.</p>

<p>As the little party stopped to rest before climbing the
rustic stile, Mary wove the leaves into bright wreaths, after
patterns which Jerusha had taught her, while their mother
smiled approvingly at their quiet enjoyment, as Mary
placed one of the wreaths on little Georgie's head.</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>They soon entered the yard; and the children were
silenced by that feeling of awe and reverence for the dead
which nature has implanted in the heart of childhood, and
which seems to survive only in proportion as its innocence
is preserved.</p>

<p>Mary walked beside her mother, while Johnnie went
before them, gazing in silence at the bright autumn flowers,
or the tall monuments, on which his eye rested until they
paused beside the new-made grave, where Johnnie was
first to speak, as he asked "if grandma knew they had
come to visit her?" While Mrs. Elmer was trying to
think of some answer to the question, Mary said quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maybe her spirit knows it up in heaven, if her body
don't know it here. Keep still, Johnnie!"</p>

<p>As Susan Elmer stood beside the grave of her mother, she
wished that she might place upon it some memorial worthy
a spot made sacred by her last repose. Then, recollecting
the little bright-eyed violets which grew in Mrs. Maddock's
yard, and her mother's fondness for them, she resolved to
cover the mound with these humble flowers. There seemed
to be an appropriateness in placing there those humble
wayside blossoms which survive so many of Spring's earlier
flowers, and Susan dwelt with pleasure on her little plan.</p>

<p>As they were preparing to leave the ground, Mary
stopped to repair the little wreath, which had come apart
with Georgie's rough handling, and placed it upon the
grave.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the wind will blow it off," said Johnnie, and
he stepped back toward the stile where he had noticed
some short pieces of painted slats lying on the grass beside
a new inclosure.</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>"Will any one care if I take these?" he said, handing
them to his mother.</p>

<p>"I think not, my dear," she answered, and placing the
two pieces in the form of a cross, she laid them upon the
little wreath.</p>

<p>The effect of that bright golden wreath lying upon the
rich, deep green grass and surmounted by the little white
cross, was very beautiful; to a practised artist it might
have suggested the illuminated paintings of the early
masters, but Susan's natural taste for beautiful things had
never been heightened by artistic cultivation, and as she
looked admiringly upon it, her greatest pleasure was that
she could leave some token of remembrance upon the
grave of her earliest and most valued friend.</p>

<p>While they were passing out of the yard, Mary and
Johnnie exclaimed together, "Aint that pretty?" pointing
toward a bright little bed of immortelles, bordered with
pansies. Mrs. Elmer read the plain inscription and was
pleased to find there the name and age of Dr. Lee, with
the simple verse,</p>

<p class="small">"He is not here, but precious is the dust<br/>

Which once enshrined the object of our love;<br/>

He is not here, but fondly do we trust<br/>

To meet him in a brighter world above."</p>

<p>There was something about that little gray Italian shaft
and those unpretending flowers which would have pleased
Mrs. Elmer, had she known nothing of her whose taste
had marked the spot or of him whose memory was here so
tenderly cherished; and Susan thought while looking at
these memorials, of the many kindnesses of her friend and
felt a degree of self-reproach that she had never been to

<!-- page 259 -->

call upon Mrs. Lee since that lady's return from the East.
True the time had been more than occupied with care and
labor, but there was also another reason, which she
scarcely recognized as such, and it was that feeling of hesitation
which any person of true refinement has at the
thought of calling as a friend upon one whose worldly
position is so much above her own as was that of Mrs.
Lee and toward whom she could but feel an embarrassing
sense of obligation.</p>

<p>Then, conscious that the neglect might have the appearance
of indifference or ingratitude, she resolved to seek an
early opportunity to express in person the grateful regard
which she had heretofore sent by Peter Jackson.</p>

<p>Presently Johnnie discovered a carriage driving into the
yard, and Mary soon espied the ebony face of Peter Jackson,
who was already showing his teeth in answer to her
signs of recognition. And, strange to say, there was
Jerusha, too, sitting beside Mrs. Lee in the carriage as if
to support her, for this was Mrs. Lee's first ride since her
illness.</p>

<p>They came directly to the little inclosure, and Jerusha
assisted Mrs. Lee to alight from the carriage, when the
latter approached Mrs. Elmer and by a gentle pressure of
the hand, and a quiet smile of welcome, expressed the
pleasure which the unlooked-for meeting gave her.</p>

<p>Jerusha and Mary were more demonstrative in their
recognition, and Mrs. Lee declared the ride had benefited
her so much she would remain there while Peter and
Jerusha took the children a little drive around the ground.
The carriage soon rolled away, and Mrs. Lee invited Susan
to a seat beside her in the little yard, and as they sat there
alone with the dead, each felt bound to the other by the

<!-- page 260 -->

tender ties of friendship and sympathy as well as the
strong bond of benevolence and gratitude.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elmer soon spoke to Mrs. Lee of Johnnie's hard
question and Mary's ready answer and asked what she
thought about the subject.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall never have much definite knowledge
about it," said Mrs. Lee, "it is a subject on which
I often talked with Dr. Lee, and I recollect he once said,
there seemed nothing unconnected with revelation which
was so little known and yet so generally believed. We
are told that the Druids, before Christianity was introduced
into Britain, believed that the beatified soul retained the
love of its country and its kind, and sometimes returned
to the earth to assist the brethren by teaching them
heavenly things, and to oppose the power of the Evil One.
In later times many theologians have maintained that it
is this mingling of the prayers and praises of the departed
with those of the living which forms 'the communion of
the Saints,' one article of the Apostles' Creed.</p>

<p>"In our own times, among the number of persons called
spiritualists, a favorite theory is, that the souls of the departed
are very near and not only take an interest in the
fortunes of their friends on earth, but are anxious to find
means of communicating that interest. While some of
a still less cultivated class believe in ghosts and supernatural
apparitions."</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Lee, will you please give me your own ideas
about it, if you will not think me rude. What do you
think about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was never anxious to express her own ideas,
but she now ventured to say that to her it seemed, "that
as far as human love was unmixed with human passion, it

<!-- page 261 -->

might survive the death of the body, and if friendship and
affection be founded on piety and virtue, and have its seat
in the soul, it need not terminate with the existence of our
material part.</p>

<p>"One whose judgment we are bound to respect has said,
'When our souls are placed in Paradise, the cares and
secular employments of time shall cease, and our employments
shall be symbolical, spiritual, holy, and pleasant.'
The nature of this subject does not admit of its being
made very plain to the senses, and as not much knowledge
is given it is not probable much will be required, and we
might, perhaps, better bestow our thoughts on subjects
more directly connected with duty here, and with salvation
hereafter."</p>

<p>Peter Jackson had now returned with Jerusha and the
children, and at Mrs. Lee's request Mary was permitted to
return home with her, while Master Johnnie, with an increased
sense of importance, assisted his mother in drawing
Georgie home.</p>

<p>Little Mary could scarce express the delight she felt in
being once more in the well-remembered places, and after
looking about the house awhile she said, "There's that
dear little chair just where it was before, and there is that
pretty picture, but where is Harriet?"</p>

<p>"Harriet is married, and she does not live here any
more," replied Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"But where does she live now?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"In the country near her friends," said Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>"Well I'm glad I know where she is. Mamma and I
have often wondered what had become of Harriet, no one
told us anything about her, and we thought that she had
gone with you."</p>

<!-- page 262 -->

<p>"Have you never seen Harriet since I went away?" said
Mrs. Lee, with evident surprise as she recollected the
unheard-from note entrusted to Harriet's care.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, we never saw her after you went away,
and we did not know where you were gone in a long time,
then Peter Jackson told us, and we were very sorry your
sister was so sick, and we missed you a great deal all the
time."</p>

<p>The child had scarcely done speaking when Mrs. Lee
turned again to Harriet's letter, in which she had said, "I
forwarded your note to Mrs. Elmer, before I left town,
and I presume you have heard from it before this time."
Mrs. Lee's first thought was to write for further explanation,
for she had many times wondered at the strange silence;
then remembering Harriet's subsequent intention of visiting
her soon, she determined to wait Harriet's intended
visit for the desired information. And as she did not
know Harriet's present address, this seemed the only way
practicable.</p>

<p>Just before little Mary started for home, Mrs. Lee told
her of a little school which had recently opened near her
house, and instructed the child to ask her mother's permission
to attend it, kindly inviting her to come there every
day for dinner, and carefully informing her that she would
provide for the tuition and the necessary books; and the
little girl returned home full of enthusiasm over the plan.</p>

<p>The brightness of that October day, the enjoyment of the
children, and the unexpected pleasure of Mrs. Lee's visit,
had seemed to inspire Susan with new life, to which the
thought of sending the little girl to school, brought additional
pleasure. She had often wished that Mary might
have such advantages, but circumstances had heretofore

<!-- page 263 -->

seemed to forbid, and she therefore set about making plans
for the improvement of the child's wardrobe, which had
been in no way improved by her stay at the Smiths.</p>

<p>Her motherly affection was stimulated perhaps, by womanly
ambition, and long after the little ones were asleep
she grew more and more wakeful in planning for the new
enterprise, and she resolved to rise an hour earlier every
morning, for the purpose of preparing Mary for school.
But on awaking the next morning, she felt a dull, uncomfortable
sensation in the head, her arms ached so that she
could scarcely use them at all, and she was compelled to
return to her bed as soon as the morning meal was finished.
Mary succeeded in putting the room in order, and brought
into practice all her little skill in nursing her mother; but
spite of her efforts Susan Elmer grew rapidly worse, and
the child went to call Mrs. Maddock's assistance.</p>

<p>The good woman soon answered the summons, and was
grieved and surprised to find Susan suffering from a violent
attack of fever. After bathing Susan's head and
applying such simple remedies as were at hand, Mrs. Maddock
said, "I'm sure when I come to think of it, I aint
a bit surprised, in fact I've expected to see you break
down every day. No live woman could endure it to be
shut up as you have been so long, and working early and
late, it's a wonder you did not have to give up before.
You need rest and good nursing up, but you must not
expect to be well in a day."</p>

<p>"Will my ma ever get well again?" interposed Mary,
timidly; for she had been frightened before calling Mrs.
Maddock, whose energetic manner did not tend to diminish
her alarm.</p>

<p>"O yes, I hope so, but we must take good care of her;"

<!-- page 264 -->

and turning again to Susan, she said, "I'd go for a doctor
right off, but the doctors kill more than they cure, and
you haven't any money to waste on them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddock again volunteered her own services, and
Susan thanked her cordially, when Mrs. Maddock returned
to her own room.</p>

<p>In the midst of her own pain Susan noticed the expression
of sorrow and anxiety upon her child's face, and she
said,</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, my dear; I hope I shall feel better
again when the fever goes off: and remember, Mary,
whatever happens, it will only make everything worse to
be sad and discouraged."</p>

<p>Then the child tried harder to summon her courage, and
to put in practice those lessons of faith and patience of
which her mother's life had been a constant lesson, both
in example and in precept. It was well for the child that
she had learned the lesson thus early.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddock's fears were realized sooner than Mrs.
Elmer's hopes, for Susan suffered long without any signs
of improvement. Now that their only means of subsistence
were cut off by the mother's illness, the little nurse's task
seemed weary and almost hopeless.</p>

<p>When Martha and Ann Maddock first heard of Mrs.
Elmer's sickness they expressed a degree of sympathy and
interest in the poor woman's misfortune quite consistent
with their late friendly conduct toward her; but after a
few days they began to express a degree of surprise that
no one came to assist in the care of her; and a slight impatience
manifested itself in the oft-repeated wonder why
none of the church members came near; for they were not
such faultless young ladies as we meet with in stories, but
such human ones as are met in actual life.</p>

<!-- page 265 -->

<p>Mrs. Maddock suggested that like enough none of them
knew anything about Mrs. Elmer's sickness.</p>

<p>"Then," said Ann, "I'll make it my business to inform
them. I think what with the 'Aid Society' and the
'Home Mission,' that it is a pretty piece of work to let a
woman like her suffer from neglect, or else be a direct tax
upon us for board, and rent, and everything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddock made no objection to the plan, and Ann
started out that very afternoon. She met Mrs. Squires on
her way to the Aid Society, and soon made known to her
the condition of the Elmer family, which seemed almost
incredible to Mrs. Squires, for it was only a few days since
she had heard from Miss Ludlow that Mrs. Lee had returned,
and had taken the Elmers under her especial
charge again. Miss Ludlow declared she had seen Mary
Elmer in Mrs. Lee's carriage, and expressed a degree of
anxiety for fear the family in general and that child in particular,
would be spoiled by being taken too much notice
of.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires, however, made it in her way to give them a
short call before going to the Aid Society, and determined
to bring the case before them at that very meeting.</p>

<p>Ann Maddock continued her way to Mrs. Lee's, where
both Mrs. Lee and Jerusha had been wondering at the
non-appearance of Mary, and had begun to fear some illness
to the child had prevented her from coming to school.
Jerusha had never been in the habit of running out evenings,
and Mrs. Lee had been very much occupied with
the fall house-cleaning, and instructing a new girl, for
Jerusha had only been with her a short time. Mrs. Elmer
had seemed so bright and happy at their last interview that
Mrs. Lee was grieved and surprised to find that she was

<!-- page 266 -->

now suffering not only the pains of illness, but for the want
of those necessaries which that sickness had rendered her
unable to procure. She sent to Mrs. Elmer many expressions
of sympathy and regret, and that very evening rode
over with Peter Jackson to carry to her friends the more
substantial tokens of her regard.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

</div>

<p>WITH the return of the cool autumn evenings there
came back to our busy town many who had been
seeking for health or recreation at the various
watering-places. The spirit of locomotion which
had led so many from home, now seemed to keep them
active, and every local enterprise revived into a new
life. The churches were better filled on the Sabbath, and
many a stylish outfit which had lost its first lustre at "The
Springs," now aroused bitter heart-burnings among those
who had perforce remained at home.</p>

<p>Miss Eunice Ludlow had also returned, for she too had
been "spending some time at the Springs." The family
alone knew the whys and the hows of the all important
though unusual event. A relative who lived at Saratoga
in a style which in more modern days would have been
called "Shoddy," had sent for Eunice, who by the way was
an expert needle-woman, to come and assist them with
their summer's sewing.</p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>Of course Cousin John would attend to the expenses of
"travelling," at least so the letter read, and he generously
fulfilled the promise by procuring a pass through the influence
of a baggage master. And now the visit was over
and Eunice had returned home full of Cousin John's importance
and the Saratoga fashions.</p>

<p>It had been at Eunice's suggestion that the Aid Society
was invited to meet at Deacon Ludlow's again. Every
one knew that the deacon's family had declared that they
had done more than their part already; but Eunice felt an
uneasy desire to inform her friends of the marvellous things
which she had seen and heard at Saratoga.</p>

<p>As a regular party was deemed quite too expensive, it
was decided to have the "Society." "It will be much
cheaper than a party," thought Mrs. Ludlow, as she remembered
the tea regulations; "and we can take a little
extra pains to invite those we want, and those we don't
want can be left to find it out for themselves."</p>

<p>The appointed day came, and with it came "The Aid
Society." Among the first arrivals was Mrs. J. Pixley
Smith arrayed in the stiff silk dress and the same prodigious
amount of jewelry in which she had appeared on the occasion
of Mrs. Squires' memorable call. Mrs. Bingham the
minister's wife, wore the same brown alpaca dress and the
same plain linen collar and black velvet bow which Miss
Eunice declared she had stuck to ever since the year one.
Mrs. Squires appeared in a dark worsted dress and rich
honiton collar fastened with a cameo pin, which Mrs.
Smith thought was very bad taste for any one that could
afford new fashioned jewelry as well as "Miss Squares,"
as she persisted in calling her.</p>

<p>We shall not trouble you with the details of the dress of

<!-- page 268 -->

Mrs. Sharpe, Mrs. Brown, and the number of ladies who
are already absorbed in listening to Miss Eunice's wonderful
accounts of her travels, while she dwells with enthusiasm
upon the elegance of Cousin John's establishment, and
the remarkable accomplishments of little Cousin Una who
is studying French arithmetic, although she is only eight
years old.</p>

<p>It could not but be observed, that Miss Eunice became
somewhat less communicative after the arrival of Mrs.
Squires. Knowing as she did that Mrs. Squires could
easily detect the parts of her story in which she had been
wholly indebted to imagination for her facts; and as
she thought of the experiences Mrs. Squires might relate
if she were only disposed to appreciate her advantages,
she looked at Mrs. Squires with pitying wonder, for her
lost opportunities.</p>

<p>There was not any work of importance on hand. The
last thing the society had attempted was a dozen shirts
for Mr. Bingham; and these being finished, the question
in order was, to what they should next devote their
efforts.</p>

<p>"I've been telling ma," said Miss Eunice, "that I
think we had better labor for the cause of foreign missions.
I heard Mr. Simpson, while I was at Cousin
John's. I was so much delighted with his farewell sermon;
he preached it in several places, and I heard it in
Saratoga, just before they left for the heathen land. His
third wife, Miss Stillman, was a particular friend of mine;
he had printed copies of the sermon for sale, and I bought
one on her account. Some parts of it were very eloquent
indeed." And taking up the pamphlet she read aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are possessed of a common origin, and a common

<!-- page 269 -->

inheritance; sent into this breathing world to work out a
common destiny. Then why should we limit the exercise
of our Christian charities and our active sympathies, to
the circumscribed limit of our own neighborhood or
county, instead of encompassing in its encircling vastness
the great human family of man."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry he did not come here," said Mrs.
Smith, "we could not possibly work for a worthier object;
and to show that we aint narrow minded in our
views. What do you think about it, Miss Squares?"</p>

<p>"I should be very sorry to be in the way of any good
work, but we should be careful not to overlook the duty
that lies nearest us; and I was intending to suggest that
we give some assistance to Mrs. Elmer, who is quite sick;
and both her children and herself are in great need of
assistance."</p>

<p>"Aint you mistaken about that?" said Mrs. Ludlow;
"I guess there aint anything serious the matter there, you
can't believe half you hear now-a-days, the world is so
wicked."</p>

<p>"I am sure I'm not mistaken, for I called there this
afternoon, and found her quite sick of a fever," replied
Mrs. Squires.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Smith, "then how do we know
but you have exposed us all to some terrible disease. If
you was anybody but Miss Squares, and the chief one of
the directorers of the society, I should say you'd done a
dretful unprudent thing a going there."</p>

<p>"I think they had better be sent to the poor-house
right off, there's no knowing but what it's the scarlet fever
she has got, and they always have that at the poor-house,

<!-- page 270 -->

so she could not do any hurt by spreading it there," said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you advise the woman that owns the
house to turn her right out," said Mrs. Sharpe; "the
rent will be more uncertain than ever if she is sick, besides,
it's never safe to keep sick folks in a house, poor
folks in particular, she might die there, and make it harder
to rent the rooms afterward."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Smith; "we are all taxed enough to
support idleness and poverty there, and I have always
thought they would come to it yet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Squires improved the first pause in the excited
clamor, to explain to the ladies that the sickness which
Mrs. Elmer suffered from need not cause them such
alarm, as it was only a low fever, induced by constant toil
and privation; and that with a little assistance and rest,
she might soon be able to return to her employment; for
she knew Mrs. Elmer better than to believe she would
willingly be a burden to her friends.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to hinder her resting at the
county-house," said Miss Eunice, "I think she ought to
be grateful that she lives in a Christian land, where a
place is erected and maintained for the indigent."</p>

<p>"But," continued Mrs. Squires, "would it not be
cruel to subject a person like Mrs. Elmer, whose only
crime is that of honest poverty, to the odium of being
classed among paupers, at a county poor-house? It does
not seem Christian, to me, for us, as an Aid Society in a
respectable church, to suffer it. I should not, perhaps,
express myself so fully, but as President of the society,
and for the credit of the organization, to say nothing of a
higher motive, I think we ought to help her."</p>

<!-- page 271 -->

<p>"I don't like to differ with a person like you," said
Mrs. Ludlow, "but the sentiments you have just expressed
wound my feelings; they remind me painfully of
the awful doctrines that Mrs. Lee teaches those that come
under her influence. Don't you remember the Bible
teaches us 'our own righteousness is filthy rags,' but if
you and Mrs. Lee have got so blinded as to think your
own works can save you, I don't see that you can do better
than improve the opportunity, and leave the Society to
a wider field of usefulness. If Mrs. Lee knows about
'em, and she ought to I'm sure, why then she must count
this fever a special providence in her behalf."</p>

<p>"Let her try it as long as I have," said Mrs. Smith,
"and I guess she'll get discouraged before she makes anything
of them. But we are taking up the Society's time
with all this miscellaneous talk, and I'm anxious to hear
about Mr. and Miss Simpson."</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy to gratify your wishes," said
Miss Eunice; "but in order to dispose of this question,
I propose that we put it to vote. Those, therefore, who
are in favor of assisting our far distant friends in their
laudable and honorable undertaking of carrying the Christian
light of the gospel into heathenism's darkest recess,
will make their wishes manifest by standing up; or by
rising to express so praiseworthy a desire; while those
who are willing to have their time appropriated for the
benefit of a certain obscure family, who seem to be in
great favor in certain quarters nearer home, may sit
still."</p>

<p>"Almost unanimous," said Eunice, as she glanced triumphantly
about the room, and saw every one upon their
feet except Mrs. Bingham and Mrs. Squires.</p>

<!-- page 272 -->

<p>"Now please to continue," said Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>"Well, I was just saying, or rather I was about to remark,
Mrs. Simpson was a particular friend of mine, and
I thought we ought to feel it a privilege to avail ourselves
of such an opportunity to assist in the great cause. The
people in Gambletown made several suits of clothing to
be sent to little namesakes of theirs in Muffletegawny,
that was the name of the station; and I don't think we
could do better than to follow their example. It's not a
new idea to me, and I have an embroidered handkerchief,
nearly finished, which I intend to mark in full, 'Eunice
Ludlow, of Saratoga;' you see it would be my name and
Cousin John's little girl's name too, and would be killing
two birds with one stone, you know."</p>

<p>"I hope Miss Simpson will teach 'em better than to
throw stones at birds, particularly out of such a nice
handkerchief as that," said Mrs. Sharpe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bingham, who had been a silent listener,
could scarcely repress her indignation, and her sense of
wrong, and ventured to repeat the old-fashioned maxim,
that "Charity begins at home," and to mention again the
claims of Mrs. Elmer; when Mrs. Smith, feeling very
sensitive about the family, and sustained, as she thought,
by the popular vote, took occasion to express herself more
fully in regard to them.</p>

<p>"I don't want to prejudice nobody, but I've tried to
help that family, if anybody ever tried to endeavor to do
anything, and I don't mean to let their ingratitude and
unthankfulness affect me, but then it's very trying."</p>

<p>"Ingratitude is very hard to bear," exclaimed Mrs.
Ludlow.</p>

<p>"But it does not lessen our obligations to be charitable.

<!-- page 273 -->

The commands and the promises nowhere put in the gratitude
of the recipient of favor as a condition of our
charity. We never find 'He that giveth to the grateful
poor, lendeth to the Lord,' else we might lose the reward
hereafter, by lowering our motives to the price of human
praise and human gratitude," said Mrs. Bingham.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Smith, "but you can't say it
aint discouraging to find the objects of our bounty proud
and extravagant, besides being low and poor. I don't
want to prejudice nobody, but facts is facts, and what I
say is to be depended on. Everybody knows that family
got along well enough before he went away, but the way
she has managed since, just shows how much she knows.
Miss Ludlow knows about it as well as I do, this big blue
velvet chair is one of her extravagances; it looked just
like new when she sold it here, and they just took it out
of charity;" here Mrs. Smith ceased her violent rocking,
and arose for the ladies to express their horror or their
admiration, as their expressions were divided between the
chair and its former owner.</p>

<p>"That's nothing at all compared to the pin that opened
my eyes," continued Mrs. Smith. "After he had been gone
a spell, and I heard how she was selling off her fineries, I
knew she had a costly pin, and so I went over prepared to
give her full as much as it was worth in old gold.
But I wan't going to buy a cat in a bag, so I just give a
good look at it. I knew it was genniwine, because he sent
it to her from Calaforny, and everything is genniwine that
comes from there. But such a pin you never did see.</p>

<p>"On the front side of it there was a locket lid, and under
it was George Elmer just as natural as life, only his face
was peekeder than ever, and his beard longer. It looked

<!-- page 274 -->

as though he had not shaved sence he went away. On the
outside of the lid was some plain checkered work; but the
inside of it beat everything. It was nothing more nor less
than a young one with a night-gown on, and a pair of
wings on its back. I could not see that it looked anything
like their cubs only them everlastin' curls. I was glad
they had modesty enough to put it inside. I shouldn't be
willing to have one of my children taken in such a plight,
it's bad enough to have them look like fury around every
day. But the motto capped the climax. I copied it with
my big gold pencil, it read '<i>a dieu pour vous</i>.' I did not
ask her what it meant, for I did not want to condescend,
but my niece translated it for me. It's French, and means
'ado for you.' I must say it's rather proper after all,
lor she made a fuss about him, after he had gone, and I
s'pose he took this way to return the compliment, and make
an ado for her. Of course such a pin would not do for a
person of any taste, and so I did not even make her an
offer for it."</p>

<p>"I've heard of that pin before, my husband offered to
take it once, on some rent that she wanted to get out of
paying; he managed to get an old clock and that was all.
I guess she had rather stick to her finery, than to pay her
honest debts," said Mrs. Sharpe.</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance
of Deacon Ludlow and Rev. Mr. Bingham, who had been
invited to take tea with the ladies. Sam Ludlow soon
made his appearance also. He was being got ready for
school in a distant town, and this fact seemed to add so
much to his social importance, that he was now expected to
be introduced to company.</p>

<p>It did not however cause him to forget any of his old

<!-- page 275 -->

tricks, for he invariably managed to say or do something
to vex and mortify his sisters.</p>

<p>The conversation seemed to take a more religious turn
upon the entrance of the minister. Mrs. Sharpe began to
express her interest in a revival which was in successful
progress in a neighboring town, and where two of her
nieces had been hopefully converted.</p>

<p>"That's just what we want here," said Mrs. Smith.
"I've been telling Mr. Smith I did so wish there was an
opportunity for him to get religion."</p>

<p>"There was a wonderful awakening at Saratoga, while
I was at Cousin John's. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson's visit
caused a great deal of emotion there; perhaps you would
like to look at his farewell sermon," said Eunice, handing
Mr. Bingham her printed copy.</p>

<p>"Maybe the ladies would like to hear some of it read
aloud," suggested Mrs. Ludlow.</p>

<p>"I should so," replied Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bingham read from the closing paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have now voluntarily banished ourselves from all
the endearments, the attractions and refinements, of a home
in civilized life. Turned our backs upon all these to
become laboring exiles, in that far distant portion of the
Lord's vineyard, to which we now pray the gales to waft
us swiftly onward, though at the risk of a watery grave."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid very few of us would be willing to follow
Miss Simpson's noble example, and leave all to follow the
Lord!" exclaimed Eunice, with a patient sigh of unappreciated
merit.</p>

<p>"That could be decided better if more missionaries come
over after wives," said Sam, with a significant grin, "I
rather guess there would be something of a scattering
among the old maids."</p>

<!-- page 276 -->

<p>Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Sharpe exchanged smiles. Mrs.
Squires directed her eyes more closely to her work. Mr.
Bingham became silently interested in the sermon, and a
pause ensued, until Mrs. Ludlow announced that "tea
was ready."</p>

<p>On the Society book it was written that there should
always be a plain tea,&mdash;"Biscuit and apple-sauce, and
only one kind of cake." Some of the guests were therefore
a little surprised, when, on taking seats at the table, they
were served with soda biscuit, raised biscuit, buns, and
strawberry shortcake, cider apple-sauce, crab-apple sauce,
pineapple, and apple jelly. Then there were fruit cake,
plain cake, and cookies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sharpe thought they were liable to a fine, for breaking
the rules of the Society. But Miss Eunice explained
it very satisfactorily,&mdash;"You all see there's only biscuit
and apple-sauce, and as for the cake, there is only one kind,
the fruit cake is just like the other, only it has some raisins
and a little citron stirred in, and the cookies are just the
same dough with a little more flour, and a few caraways
added."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith said, that according to her ideas, it was
breaking the rules in the right direction, and for her part
she was willing to swallow the offence, as she helped
herself to a large slice of fruit cake, laughing audibly at
her own attempted wit.</p>

<p>Soon after tea Mr. and Mrs. Bingham expressed their
desire to leave. Mr. Bingham had promised to make a
sick call, and Mrs. Bingham was to go to see Mrs. Lee,
whom she had not seen in a long time, and her husband
was to join her at Mrs. Lee's, to return home.</p>

<p>There was an immediate lengthening of faces as Mr.

<!-- page 277 -->

Bingham spoke of going, and such a universal expression
of interest in the welfare of Zion, and such a desire for a
special effort expressed by several, that Mr. Bingham felt
compelled to propose obtaining the assistance of Mr. Phillips,
a noted revivalist, to help in the work, and it was
decided that he should write immediately for the desired aid.
Miss Eunice expressed her regret at the necessity of the
sick call, and wished the visit to Mrs. Lee could be postponed,
the company would regret so much to lose them so
early in the evening.</p>

"Better have 'em find out who that chap at Mrs. Lee's
is," said Sam, with his usual significant leer at Eunice.
No one replied. Mr. Bingham was called upon to address
the Throne of Grace, and made a short but earnest prayer,
when Mr. and Mrs. Bingham bade the company good
night. As soon as they were out of hearing, Sam said
"That was a pretty good oration to the Lord." And on
being reproved for his irreverence, very gravely asked his
mother to explain the difference between an "oration to
the Lord," and an "address to the Throne of Grace."
"You see I am going to school and I want to understand
these things."

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

</div>

<p>AT Mrs. Lee's, Mr. Bingham found Dr. Charles
Lee, the person to whom Sam Ludlow had reference.
He is a nephew of the late Dr. Lee, and
has stopped to pay a visit on his return from California.
It is not his first visit to our little town; years before
he had come hither with the intention of studying medicine
with his uncle. The intention, however, had been hastily
overruled by the sad dispensation, with which our story
begins, and after his uncle's lamented death he had completed
his course in a neighboring city, and subsequently
practised in San Francisco, where his earnest efforts had
been rewarded by the esteem and confidence of a large
and thriving practice, as well as by those more material
returns which the world counts as the criterion of success.</p>

<p>The relation of Dr. Lee's pleasant adventures, assisted
no doubt by her own determination not to dwell upon sad
or painful memories during his visit, had already told
favorably upon Mrs. Lee's health, and nearly every pleasant
day found them riding or walking out in company.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, as they were passing the
residence of the Smiths, the attention of Dr. Lee was
arrested by the dog Bounce lying near the gate, and walking
more slowly and eying the dog with increased interest
he said, "I declare, aunty, that dog looks like an old
acquaintance."</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>His interest in the noble fellow increased as Bounce immediately
jumped up and running up to them, placed his
left foot immediately upon the Doctor's hand. "I really
believe I have found an old patient," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"And so I am to infer that your practice extended to
dogs," said Mrs. Lee, smiling at the rapid progress of
their mutual recognition.</p>

<p>"I don't hesitate to own it did to this fellow," replied
the Doctor examining a well-defined scar on Bounce's still
extended foot. "I think there's no mistake; this is poor
Elmer's dog, and that scar shows the very spot where his
foot was hurt while he was in the mines."</p>

<p>"Was it George Elmer?" asked Mrs. Lee, with interest,
"the young man who went from this place?"</p>

<p>"I never knew where he was from, I think the name
was George&mdash;the man was sick in the hospital, and had a
pretty severe time with a prevailing fever."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe he died of it, after a time; at least that
was the report which was brought back here."</p>

<p>"Oh no, he did not die of the fever; he was very ill
for a long time, but I remember distinctly that he recovered
and went to work again."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see Smith, the shoemaker?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I did; there were any number of
Smiths there but I don't recollect having a particular
acquaintance with any of them."</p>

<p>"Then you never knew what became of Elmer after his
sickness?" said Mrs. Lee inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I think he was in the hospital when I left, and that
was some months afterward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was very much interested in what she had
learned of the husband of her friend, and that very evening

<!-- page 280 -->

availed herself of the opportunity, while her nephew
was writing to his family, of going out to carry to Mrs.
Elmer the intelligence which she was so happy to be the
medium of conveying.</p>

<p>As she approached the house and was thinking how to
give expression to the good news in store for her friend,
little Mary, who had discovered her approach, ran out to
meet her, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"How glad I am you have come! mamma has got a
letter and it made her almost well, and my papa was alive
all the time, and Mr. Smith told a naughty story; is it not
wonderful?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee kissed the little girl in congratulation, and
went into the house, where her tears of sympathy were
soon mingled with the drops of joy that flowed freely down
Susan's face as they spoke together words of gratitude to
God for the blessed tidings which had been so long delayed.</p>

<p>We cannot furnish our readers a copy of the letter
which gave Susan so much pleasure, for she had not that
vulgar ambition of display which might have induced some
to send it to the newspapers; nor did she circulate it about
for neighborhood comment and criticism. Those, therefore,
who wish to know more of George Elmer will be
compelled to go with us on the long journey to California.
And as it will only be fair to give our friends a parting
call before taking leave of them for the long journey, we
will stop at the meeting-house on the way.</p>

<p>The new lamps are now in constant use, for while we
have been engaged in other matters, the revival has not
only been fairly inaugurated but is going on with increased
activity and zeal. And as it is the opinion of those most
interested, that its prosperity is wholly owing to the efforts

<!-- page 281 -->

of Rev. Mr. Phillips, some may wish a more formal introduction
to this distinguished revivalist. He is a person
rather above the medium height, with large hazel eyes
which, but for a total lack of expression, might be called
beautiful. His coal-black hair was parted in a fashion which
showed no neglect from its owner; his manner is affable
and conciliating, and his dress of glossy black broadcloth
as faultless as the most fastidious tailor could devise. Some
insinuating person has intimated that a sudden improvement
in his personal appearance is closely connected with
the recent death of his wife; and a facetious friend has
hinted that even his hair has become several shades darker
to match the new mourning suit; but of the truth of these
hints we are not personally responsible, although certain
it is, that his popularity has never suffered in consequence
of the fact that Mr. Phillips is a widower.</p>

<p>His sermons, in the opinion of some, were mere platitudes,
with a faint shadow of an idea clothed in one weak
syllogism after another, but without force or pith, while
his prayers were only a medley of threatened wrath to
evil doers, a report of neighborhood gossip, and a dispensation
of full and free salvation to the elect; but whatever
of adverse criticism might be bestowed upon these efforts,
there was a charm and sweetness in the melody of his voice
to which not even the most hostile could listen without
admiration. The sentiments which he made this heaven-bestowed
talent the means of conveying, may be better
learned from one of his favorite hymns, than from any
words of ours, and we copy one of them from the printed
sheets which were liberally distributed throughout the
church:&mdash;</p>

<p>We will leave the spiritual affairs of our friends to the
pastoral care of their musical shepherd, while we make a
hasty trip to California for the purpose of inquiring after

<!-- page 283 -->

our friends at San Francisco. We shall not ask you to
brave the perils by sea of a voyage around the Cape, nor
the risks and hazards of a railroad trip, because we prefer
the safer and more direct line of our own imagination.</p>

<p>It is true that Smith has left George Elmer very sick
indeed, and the fever has long seemed to defy the physician's
skill and the nurse's care. Before this calamity had
overtaken him, however, he had, while yet the enthusiasm
of a new enterprise lasted, accumulated a thousand
dollars which he had confided to Smith's offered charge for
the little family at home. Elmer was too ill at the time
of the transaction to attend to any legal papers, and the
worse sickness which followed had so impaired his memory
that he had never even wondered why it was never
heard from. He had lingered long, conscious only of the
change from intense pain to a languid stupor, and when
the violence of the disease had at last passed away, the
wild expression of the eye and the strange incoherence of
speech formed no uncertain indication of the sad havoc of
disease.</p>

<p>Though his mental faculties had suffered much under the
painful malady, yet as his strength returned, with it came
back so much of George Elmer's former enterprise that he
was soon able to apply himself to the practice of his old
business of dentistry.</p>

<p>A little office had been provided in a part of the hospital
for a former patient, and as such services were in great
demand and George had always been a skilful workman,
he was soon gaining a handsome remuneration; he never
spoke of his family or friends, and was always quiet and
reserved towards every one except the little children, who
frequently came in to bring flowers or dainties to the patients,

<!-- page 284 -->

and on whom he bestowed the curious little devices,
the manufacture of which occupied his leisure.</p>

<p>There was in the same ward with Elmer a man by the
name of Goulding, who had been seriously injured by the
blasting of a rock, and brought in some time after Elmer.
For many weeks each failed to recognize the other as an
old acquaintance and former partner; yet it was not very
strange, for Goulding had supposed with many others that
Elmer had died of the fever; and the effects of that fearful
malady upon the memory of the latter, had prevented his
recognizing any person except those who had been constantly
with him.</p>

<p>It was a matter of surprise to Goulding that after a recognition
had taken place, Elmer received with such
indifference his accounts of the richness of the claims in
which they owned a mutual interest; and not until one
evening; when Mrs. Goulding had come in as usual to
spend an hour with her husband did Elmer appear fully
to have recovered his former self. Goulding had asked
his wife to sing for him, and as she finished the second
stanza of that sweet little song entitled "Star of the Evening,"
noticing the strange effect the words seemed to
have upon his friend, Goulding begged her to stop.</p>

<p>Elmer's face was pale with emotion, and his eyes dim
with unshed tears, as he asked in a tremulous voice,
"Where's my wife? Where's Susan, and why does not
she come and sing the Shining Star to me?"</p>

<p>Some of the attendants were alarmed, and feared a relapse
of the disease, but they soon learned that it was only
the sweet, soothing power of music that had roused that
hidden chain in which the thoughts of those he loved had
so long been lulled, and he grew calmer as the recollection

<!-- page 285 -->

of that far-away fireside, the worn and wasted form of the
aged grandmother, the earnest but uncomplaining face of
his wife, and the happy voices of his little children, seemed
to come like a beacon of life and hope to the storm-bound,
ocean-wrecked mariner. He soon indited the letter, of the
safe arrival of which we have learned, and as he intends
very soon to follow it, we will go back to find what preparations
are being made for his return.</p>

<p>The news of the arrival of a letter from George Elmer
soon spread through the town, where it shared with the
sayings and doings of the new converts, among whom
Sam Ludlow and J. P. Smith were prominent in being the
principal topics of conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Pixley Smith was among the first to call upon
Mrs. Elmer to inquire the particulars of the letter; and as
the facts in relation to the money, and also some allusions
to the dog came to light, Smith's interest in the affair became
decidedly personal, and he interrupted Mrs. Elmer
before she had finished reading, by saying,</p>

<p>"I've been intending this long time to come in and explain
matters to you. You know we have tried to share
the burden of your children with you, and then we've kept
the dog; dogs are great eaters, and it would eat you out
of house and home to have such a voracious fellow as
Bounce around; but if you want the critter, you can have
him. Then as to money matters, you seemed so comfortable
I thought it best to save what I had for you till a
rainy day; but if you think you need any, I s'pose I must
let you have some, though women folks in general squander
it awfully."</p>

<p>Mrs. Elmer might perhaps have been overcome with
indignation at this speech had not her heart been too full

<!-- page 286 -->

of gladness at the thought of her husband's return, and she
replied, "God has taken care of us so far, and he will not
forsake us now. You can bring the money or leave it to
settle with Mr. Elmer, for I am not anxious to have any
transactions with you."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith felt very angry at the honest indignation
which Mrs. Elmer had expressed, but as there was now no
apparent benefit to be derived from delay, he immediately
applied himself to collecting the amount.</p>

<p>He availed himself of the advantage which his conspicuousness
in the late revival had given him, and as he was
now counted among the "active brethren," and his wife
directress in "The Muffletegawny Missionary Aid Society,"
the brilliant thought of circulating a subscription paper for
the benefit of that popular institution, occurred to him, and
wishing to show his liberality, his zeal, and his pecuniary
ability in one bold stroke, he headed the list with a donation
of one hundred dollars. It was soon increased by the addition
of smaller sums, and in a short time he was able to
hand over the thousand to Mrs. Elmer, beside leaving a
comfortable sum for his own pocket.</p>

<p>The dog which had been pronounced "a nuisance,"
"a cuss," and "a filthy squadruped," at the Smith residence,
was the subject of an excited "family scene" when
Smith declared his intention to give it away. Mrs. Smith
called him a cruel, hard-hearted monster to give away the
only thing the children ever did care anything about. The
girls pouted, and declared they wouldn't go to school;
Ferdinand shut Bounce in the bedroom, and placing himself
against the door, armed with his father's cane declared
"he'd see if the old man dared to touch his dorg." Meantime
Smith retreated to the back yard and waited till the

<!-- page 287 -->

excitement was over, and then coaxing Bounce with a beef
bone which he had picked up in the morning at a butcher's
stall and had been carrying for that purpose all day, he led
the dog in the direction of Mrs. Elmer's, where he was
soon discovered by Johnnie, who had been some time
watching for his appearance. He was soon joined by
Mary to whom he had conveyed information of the important
arrival.</p>

<p>There was a very joyful meeting between the little girl
and her old friend who seemed to forget the ill usage he
had received from the youthful Smiths so much as to make
every demonstration of friendship to Johnnie and Georgie
to whom she gave him the most flattering introduction.
As the former annoyances were removed, Bounce became
not only the friend and companion of the Elmers, but the
favorite of the neighborhood, where his somewhat unusual
history had made him an object of more than ordinary
interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddock was quite overcome with delight at the
good fortune of the Elmers, although she declared it had
all happened just as she had expected ever since she heard
that dream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee improved the earliest opportunity which Harriet's
visit afforded to investigate the affair of the mysterious
disappearance of the note, and had succeeded in settling
it with Deacon Ludlow by giving him a receipt in full on
his paying the exact amount which had been inclosed in
the letter. The deacon congratulated himself on being
abundantly able to meet the demand, expressing at the
same time his satisfaction that Sam was done sowing
his wild oats and had "got religion" now, while it was
evident that the thought of Sam's making any restitution

<!-- page 288 -->

for the wrong he had done never once occurred to the
deacon's mind. The teachers tell me Sam is doing first
rate now, and I am glad we had that revival just in time
to save him.</p>

<p>Those who wish to be informed of this young gentleman
from his own words, can do so by reading a letter which
has lately been received from him by John Sharpe, a son
of Mrs. Elmer's former landlord.</p>

<p>DEAR JACK,&mdash;It's an awful long time since I heard from
you. I was dreadful sorry you got shut up just as I came
away, for I wanted to see you desperately. I'm sorry you
want there to get religion when I did; I tell you it's the
best investment I've made lately, for it helps a fellow along
mightily. This is a first rate school; I can stay out as late
as I please, and no questions asked, but if one of the chaps
that hasn't got religion is caught away from his room after
nine, he gets a walking ticket,&mdash;whew!</p>

<p>I tell you, Jack, we had a gay old examination. I got excused
from my classes to practise my oration. I wrote on
"Religious Forms," for I knew all the old dominies and
deacons would be appointed judges, and the fellow that put
in the most piety would get the prize. I took care to put
in a good rouser about the "old dragon and the old seven
hills." You see it's always safe to give popery a death.
blow; besides, denunciation suits my style of oratory.</p>

<p>It took like a molasses fly-trap, and I got a tremendous
big Bible for the first prize. I sold it for four fifty, and our
society, the L. A.'s had a gay old spree on that, you may
bet. We have a uniform here for parade days and such
like. It's a grand arrangement, for we wear the old things
that the others leave, and then the money answers lots of
purposes.</p>

<p>There's an Episcopal society here; they've got a real nice

<!-- page 289 -->

meeting-house, and a very polite chap for a minister. They
are ever so popular, and I had quite a notion of joining
them, but the fellow has taken a pious turn of late and begins
to talk about self-denial and alms deeds in a way that
I don't relish. I like the notion of every-day piety; that
means something you can always make useful. Now's the
present time, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush. This going without your beef-steak and sticking to
codfish and mackerel six weeks in March is what I call a
scaly performance. I wish you would write as soon as possible
and tell me how all the folks are getting along. I wonder
if Eunice will make out to catch Mr. Phillips. I'm
glad you kept dark about that old Elmer affair. I have
never felt just right about it; I knew the old man would
fork over if I only got religion. After all it was not a
mighty sight meaner than his buying her chairs for less than
half they were worth, because he knew she was obliged to
sell them. If ever I make a lift again, it will be on an Express
Office or a bank; there's something mean in robbing a
poor widow, but then if I get as much saving faith as the
old man has, I shan't be so scrupulous. I am going into
the storage and foraging business as soon as I get through
here, and if that don't pay I may come back and marry
Mary Elmer, by way of righting old scores; that is if
Elmer really brings back the dust.<br/>

Yours forever,<br/>

SAM LUDLOW.</p>

<p>P.S. Please direct your letter to Miss Sarah Loomis
care of S. Ludlow Esq. You see we are expected to have
our letters sent to the care of the professors, who take pains
to read them for us, and I want to save them that trouble.<br/>

<p>On receiving the sums of money from Mrs. Lee and

<!-- page 290 -->

Mr. Smith, Mrs. Elmer's first care was to secure for herself
and family a home, where they and her expected husband
would be more comfortable. And although their
present prosperity, as indicated in George's letter, might
warrant them in selecting some more aspiring locality, it
was Susan's highest ambition to return to the little cottage
where they had first started housekeeping, and from
which George had gone forth on his journey.</p>

<p>Here the pleasures of their early wedded years had
been crowned with joy, by the birth of their first-born
child, the darling Mary; and here Johnnie had received a
father's smile of welcome, and a mother's kiss of love, as
he added new happiness to a home which had been already
full of light and gladness. And in later years, when the
rough winds of adversity seemed untempered to the shorn
lambs, and the dark, hard hand of poverty seemed ready
to crush them, had little Georgie brought the smiles of
infant innocence to cheer once more the desolate home,
and to prevent the thoughts of his mother from flowing
always in the same dark channel.</p>

<p>Here, too, had been learned many a lesson of trusting
hope, and patient, quiet submission, from the example of
that aged mother, whose memory was still embalmed in
the sighs, and dewed with the tears of affectionate remembrance.</p>

<p>The little cottage was soon engaged, and the few preparations
for moving were quickly completed. Mrs. Maddock,
with characteristic liberality, declared that it would
be time enough for her to take the rest, when George
Elmer was safe home again.</p>

<p>As Susan and the children were following their little
stock of furniture to their new home, she was startled by

<!-- page 291 -->

the sight of a carriage at the door, and quite excited at the
thought that her husband had possibly preceded her there.
Her surprise abated, however, when on entering the house
she found her visitor to be Mrs. Bennet Squires, who had
lately returned from an absence of several weeks.</p>

<p>It had been the surprise and horror of many of her
neighbors, that she could think of going away just in the
midst of the revival; and Mrs. Smith had even gone so
far as publicly to propose her name as a subject for their
prayers.</p>

<p>Certainly the religion of Mrs. Squires was very different
from that of Mrs. Smith; for she was always ready to
assist the poor by her sympathy and her bounty, without
making a catalogue of their faults. While she gave to her
equals or her superiors in worldly things, the offices of
kindness, without taking the census of their virtues; she
never made it her business to censure or find fault with
her clergyman, even though his sermons contained doctrines
and opinions quite at variance with her own. Nor
did she sneer at, or find fault with those persons who
thought they found aids to piety and excellence in things
which to her judgment appeared only the excitement of
passion, or the sway of popular public sentiment; ever
showing a commendable respect for honest differences of
opinion and of belief.</p>

<p>The object of the present visit added another to the
many kindnesses with which she had made glad the home
of the Elmers; for she had come to place in its old corner
the little clock, of whose existence she had first heard
at the society at Deacon Ludlow's. She had been anxious
to give to Susan some token of the pleasure she felt
at the new turn of events, and could not have found a
more welcome expression of her kindness.</p>

<!-- page 292 -->

<p>Many other pieces of furniture found their way back;
the blue velvet rocking-chair soon took its accustomed
commanding position in the little front parlor, and really
looks almost as bright as before its stay at the Deacon's,
where the hospitality had never been such as to tell unfavorably
upon the parlor furniture. Susan was very glad
to get the chair again; it had been one of her few wedding
presents, and was the gift of a liberal and wealthy
friend, in New York City.</p>

<p>Deacon Ludlow had shown considerable reluctance at
Mrs. Elmer's request to repurchase the chair. "I&mdash;I&mdash;I
s'pose you know I never offered my furniture for sale,
Miss Elmer," he said; but Susan distinctly remembered
the well-feigned reluctance with which he had paid her the
paltry sum of six dollars for it. She could almost hear
his words again, as he said, " 'Taint everybody that would
want to buy an odd piece of furniture like that, and you
will find it pretty heavy to carry round, if you try to sell
it that way."</p>

<p>Remembering these things as Susan did, she gained
courage to urge her request, which the Deacon hesitatingly
acknowledged.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but being it's you, I shall hev to let
you take it for ten dollars; 'taint a circumstance to what
it's worth; besides you see furniture is riz."</p>

<p>Susan had just got comfortably settled, when George
returned. We shall not intrude upon the pleasure of their
first meeting; but several weeks have now passed, since
the scattered members of the loving household were reunited,
and though tender and mournful remembrances of
the past mingle with the pleasures of the present hour,
and give them a subdued and chastened coloring, theirs

<!-- page 293 -->

is a quiet happiness which glittering splendor and dashing
grandeur might covet in vain.</p>

<p>George Elmer sits beside the work-table, reading the
last number of the Dental Journal, while Susan sits near,
plying her needle as in days of old. Georgie is asleep,
and Johnnie is at play building a miniature village.
Jerusha sits in a retired corner, where Mary is assisting
her to learn her lesson for the Bible class. She is still
living at Mrs. Lee's, and frequently comes over to visit
her early friend. Bounce lies upon a comfortable rug
beside the stove, looking contented and happy, in spite of
all the trials and changes through which he had passed,
and watching his master's eyes whenever they turn, while
with an instinct almost human, he makes his master's welcome
understood.</p>

<p>When George Elmer had finished reading the paper, he
folded it carefully, and laying it upon the table turned to
Susan, and in a tone which brought a smile of recognition
upon Mary's face, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, Susy, sing The Shining Star."</p>

<p>And soon that cheerful room echoed with the well-remembered
words, as they all united in the chorus,&mdash;</p>

<p>Look up, my soul, be like the lark,<br/>

That singing soars afar,<br/>

There's not a cloud, however dark,<br/>

But veils a shining star.</p>

<h1>LETTERS FROM TIMBERVILLE.</h1>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

</div>

<p>I HAVE been a full year at Timberville, and have
never yet told you a word about it. And as you
know nothing concerning it, excepting that it does
not lie on the direct route to anywhere, but off on
one side by itself, I'll be bound but you think it a little bit
of a quiet, unimportant village, made up of a tavern, a
store, a <i>meeting-house</i>, a blacksmith's shop, and a few straggling
dwelling houses. How mistaken you are. Timberville
is a large village&mdash;a very large village. I should not
wonder if we should be a city in a few years; for we are
a very enterprising people, and there is a deal of business
done here. We have ever so many streets, and any
quantity of tall, white houses, belonging to no particular
order of architecture, but invariably graced with piazzas,
adorned with four huge columns. We have, also, plenty
of red brick mansions with a great many green window
blinds; and also, now and then, a handsome stone dwelling.
And, like all populous and thriving villages, we
have our complement of forlorn, shabby, rickety old
shells, stuffed full of beings as forlorn and shabby as themselves.
Poverty, vice, and intemperance abound here.
No doubt we shall be a city in a few years.

<!-- page 298 -->

<p>Timberville is delightfully situated on both sides of a
beautiful little stream, (or, as our enterprising villagers
say, <i>it has fine mill privileges</i>,) and surrounded by tree-clad
hills. I am never weary looking at our hills, beautiful
at all times, but particularly so in the autumn, when
they are arrayed in a robe of every variety of color, from
the most gorgeous crimson to the softest ash. "What
beautiful hills!" said I, enthusiastically, as I was one day
walking with a worthy gentleman. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;fine
timberland," said he.</p>

<p>Our society is very much like the society in all growing
villages. We have good people and bad people; rich
people and poor people; wise people and ignorant people;
liberal people and stingy people; sharp people and dull
people; <i>cute</i> people and <i>numb</i> people; industrious people
and lazy people. People who mind their own business
and people who mind their neighbors' business. Honest
people and dishonest people; literary people and illiterate
people, and <i>soi disant</i> literary people (excuse that French
word.) We have gay people and serious people; noisy
people and quiet people; people who go to church and
people who stay away from church. We have temperate
people and intemperate people. People who read the
newspaper, and people who have "other fish to fry."
People who <i>take</i> "<i>Godey</i>," and people who <i>borrow</i>
"<i>Godey</i>." We shall certainly be a city before many
years.</p>

<p>We have all sorts of societies, too. Missionary societies,
Bible societies, tract societies, sewing societies,
maternal societies, mutual improvement societies, sons of
temperance and daughters of temperance societies, odd
fellows' societies, and an odd ladies' society, composed

<!-- page 299 -->

chiefly of ancient maidens. We have freemasons' societies,
literary societies, woman's rights societies, anti-everything
societies, benevolent societies for all sorts of objects,
"too numerous to mention," (as the menagerie bills say
when they get down to the monkeys.) In short, we have
every kind of society that you can possibly mention. Are
we not in a fair way of being a city?</p>

<p>As is the case in almost all new <i>enterprising</i> villages,
the chief distinction among us is that of "rich and poor."
So soon as a man is able to put up, or even to hire, a large
house with two parlors and folding-doors, and furnish it
showily, he takes his standing among the <i>first</i>. The one
grand object of the Timbervillians is to get rich. They
are all agog just now about California. Mr. Martin, and
Mr. Crandal, and Mr. Wiggins, have almost made up
their minds to abandon their respective occupations and set
off for the gold country; and their wives are quite delighted
with the idea; for Mrs. Martin wants a great many
things which Mr. Martin, rich as he is, cannot afford now.
And Mrs. Crandal is very desirous that Mr. Crandal
should go, in order that he may come back able to build a
grander house than Mr. Martin's, with larger columns and
more green blinds. She knows she's as good as Mrs.
Martin, any day, and she'd like to let other people know it.
And Mrs. Wiggins teases her husband from morning till
night to "Go to Californy, where they say you've only
to dig up the gold just as you would potaters;" for she
<i>does</i> want a house of her own, and a <i>sofy</i> and some <i>curtings</i>
as good as that <i>stuck</i>-up Mrs. Crandal's; and she fears
that Mr. Wiggins will never be able to get them as long as
he stays here and delves away at his trade. "Gold!
gold! gold!" is the cry from every mouth, old and young.
Oh, we shall soon be a city.</p>

<!-- page 300 -->

<p>I would like to introduce you to some of our <i>first</i>, and
let you see in what sort of society I have the honor to
mingle. Now do not suppose that I have procured the
ability to present you among the "upper ten," by one of
the aforesaid tall houses with big parlors and folding-doors;
by no means; I am only a boarder in Timberville.
But where shall we go?&mdash;to a party? Now, pray, don't
turn up your nose at the idea of a party in Timberville.
I assure you, we have our parties, real genuine ones, too,
as good as any in Philadelphia&mdash;assemble at ten o'clock&mdash;have
supper at twelve or one&mdash;dance all night, and
"don't go home till morning"&mdash;for the Timbervillians
would think it very ungenteel and countrified to keep
reasonable hours. We <i>must</i> be a city very soon.</p>

<p>But, on reflection, I think I'll not take you to a party&mdash;they
are too promiscuous. Nor will I bore you with a
sociable tea-drinking&mdash;decidedly one of the most tiresome
things in the world, the world over. And in Timberville
they are just what they are everywhere else, (making
allowance for some few local peculiarities.) The ladies
collecting in little knots; some talking scandal, some more
innocently discussing the fashions, but by far the greater
portion descanting upon the various trials and troubles they
have with their "helps;" while the very small sprinkling
of the sterner sex&mdash;who never talk at such gatherings,
and who go only because their wives insist upon it&mdash;are
leaning back in their chairs against the wall, half asleep,
and heartily wishing themselves at home, or in some place
more congenial with their tastes.</p>

<p>Suppose you go with me to one of our numerous societies.
Don't be alarmed; it's not to the "odd ladies," nor
the "daughters of temperance," nor the "woman's rights

<!-- page 301 -->

society," that we are going. I am not a member of any
of them. But put on your fix-ups, and prepare to accompany
me to the "Timberville literary circle," where you
will be sure to meet the <i>&eacute;lite</i> (another French word&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;perhaps, however, you do not dislike to see
French and English mixed together as badly as I do).
We are to meet this very evening at the hospitable mansion
of Mrs. Bolton, a very literary lady; but you shall see for
yourself&mdash;I'll not anticipate. Stop a moment; I must
put "Godey" in my pocket. Not the veritable individual
himself. If his own account is to be trusted, that would
be rather more than I could do. But my "Godey's
Lady's Book" for the month. I am one of the readers for
this evening, and I find, by experience, that I am not half
as welcome when I come armed and equipped with an
original article as when I bring my "Godey."</p>

<p>So here we go; and as we are on our way, I will tell
you something about our "circle," and how I, little <i>I</i>,
came to be a member of so august a body. It was on this
wise. The good people discovered that I <i>took the newspapers;</i>
not a very common thing in Timberville, where it
is usually as much as the inhabitants can "afford" to take
some one of the village papers, of which we have three&mdash;organs
of the three political parties of the place&mdash;and
which blaze away at each other with a zeal worthy the
cause, and in a style equal to any of the city organs.
Young Mr. Morgan, the head clerk at the post-office, was
the first person who promulgated the important fact. He
told Miss Carpenter, and Miss Carpenter, who is a member
of the literary circle, announced, at the next meeting of that
society, that there was a lady boarding at Mrs. Pratt's who
took no less than <i>four papers;</i> Mr. Morgan told her so

<!-- page 302 -->

himself; and she was sure I must be of a decidedly literary
turn. In fact, she had her suspicions that I was the authoress
of certain sonnets signed "Euphrasia," which had
been copied into the "Timberville Weekly Gazette and
People's Advocate." If so, I would be quite an acquisition
to the "circle." (Miss Carpenter herself perpetrates
poetry, and is considered quite <i>blue</i>.) The other members
thought that if I was not a literary character, I must at least
be <i>rich</i>, or I could not afford to take so many papers, notwithstanding
I seemed to be living in such a plain, private
way. In either case, they decided that it would be safe to
invite me to attend the circle.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this resolution, I was waited upon by
Miss Carpenter and Mrs. Stokes, and favored with a very
learned conversation, kept up principally by Miss Carpenter.
Mrs. Stokes is not particularly literary&mdash;she
owes her membership to her very large parlors and great
skill in getting up a variety of refreshments.</p>

<p>On rising to take leave, the ladies (as is the custom in
Timberville) apologized most vehemently for not having
called before, and urged me very strongly to return their
visit very soon; and Mrs. Stokes, after Miss Carpenter
had winked hard at her several times, to indicate that she
was the proper person to perform the office, invited me to
attend a literary <i>sawree</i> at her residence on the ensuing
evening. Which Miss Carpenter followed up with the remark
that she hoped I might find it "a desirable relief
from the undiversified monotony of a boarding life." Or
it might, as in her own case, "afford a relaxation to the
mind after severer application and more profound occupation,
to indulge for a time in the perusal of the lighter
literature of the day."</p>

<!-- page 303 -->

<p>I attended the sawree, (as Mrs. Stokes called it,) and
being soon after elected a member, have been quite regular
in my attendance since. And I assure you it is, as Miss
Carpenter predicted, a relief to my mind and an amusement
to my head, to come in contact with the variety of
characters which I there meet.</p>

<p>But here we are. Sit down beside me on this sofa; the
members are not all here yet, and we shall have a little
time to chat before we are called to order.</p>

<p>That short, dumpy lady, who is bobbing about in a very
stiff silk dress flounced nearly to the waist, is our hostess,
Mrs. Bolton. She is a great patroness of literature, and
herself a personage of remarkable erudition, and excessively
fond of reading. As she expresses it, she <i>literarily</i>
devours her favorite authors. It must be confessed that
she knows the names of a good many authors, and a good
many books, though she does not always <i>match</i> them quite
correctly. She thinks that Dean Swift has some genius;
his "Rasselas" is a proof of it; but it is a great pity that
he ever wrote so vulgar a book as "Don Quixote." She
says that Byron's "Deserted Village" interests her sympathies
exceedingly, although the majority of critics pronounce
his "John Gilpin" his master-piece. She has a
perfect passion for Milton's "Tasso" and "Dante," and
actually dotes on his "Lady of the Lake."</p>

<p>Such being her acquirements, she, of course, is very
capable of discovering and appreciating literary qualifications
in others. She delights in drawing modest merit
from obscurity, and in giving bashful genius a <i>boost</i>. It is
through her instrumentality that Mr. Boors, the alarmed
young man who sits in the corner staring so hard at
vacancy, and Miss Quince, the young lady with a projecting

<!-- page 304 -->

forehead and long ringlets, who is bending over the table
as completely absorbed in a volume of Mrs. Hemans, as
if it was the first time she had seen the work, have been
introduced to the notice of the Timberville literati. These
two individuals are great admirers of Mrs. Bolton, who
protests that Mr. Boors is a very intellectual young man,
and that Miss Quince has a great deal of talent. Neither
of them has as yet made any display of ability; for Mr.
Boors invariably sits all the evening just as he is now,
and Miss Quince never speaks excepting in monosyllables.
Probably they both, like the celebrated owl, keep up a
tremendous thinking.</p>

<p>The tall lady, with a very long neck and little waist, is
Miss Carpenter, our cerulean sonnet writer.</p>

<p>The pretty girl with a white rose in her hair, is Miss
Carrol, the sweetest singer in Timberville. She is a belle,
and a wit withal. There is a lawlessness about her which
would hardly be tolerated in any one but a beauty and a
belle. And yet I like the girl for her truthfulness. The
would-be-dignified gentleman who sits beside her, is Mr.
Griffin, her warmest admirer and most especial butt. He
is a critic; a very severe one, too. He is never satisfied
with anything produced in the circle. Indeed, I believe
there is but one composition in the world that he admires
without qualification, and that is Poe's "Raven." He
never writes for us; but he is so very fastidious that, of
course, we all think he <i>can</i> do wonders if he will but condescend.
And Miss Carrol is constantly teasing him to
favor us with something <i>ravenous</i>.</p>

<p>Those two gentlemen conversing together are rival
editors. The short, fat one, he who has what a facetious
friend of mine calls a <i>vegetable countenance</i>, i. e., <i>turn-up</i>

<!-- page 305 -->

nose, <i>reddish</i> complexion, and <i>carroty</i> whiskers, is the
celebrated individual whose voice, thundering through the
columns of the "Timberville Herald of Liberty and Freeman's
Journal," makes monarchs tremble, thrones totter,
and Old Hunkers shake in their shoes. His tall, thin
neighbor occupies the chair editorial of the "Timberville
Weekly Gazette and People's Advocate." (Our papers,
like our people, all have double names.) How delightful
to see the urbanity with which they can meet. It seems
hardly possible that they have just been tearing each other
to pieces at such a terrible rate, "through the medium of
the press."</p>

<p>The gentleman who is just entering the room, with a
linen roundabout, and his pants tucked inside of his boots,
is Mr. Bolton, the <i>worser</i> half of our hostess, and a horse-dealer
by profession. He couldn't spend time to change
his dress; it was as much as he could do to come in at all.
It is true that Mrs. Bolton, who is not very proud of her
unintellectual spouse, has repeatedly assured him that there
was no necessity for his coming in this evening; he needn't
trouble himself, &amp;c., &amp;c. Still, Mr. Bolton, who is a
kind-hearted man, thought he would just come in long
enough to say how d'ye do, and let his neighbors know
that he was glad to see them at his house. Poor Mrs.
Bolton! she looks perfectly <i>consterned</i> at his appearance.
Her countenance says very plainly, "Won't he catch it
for coming to the <i>sawree</i> in such a fix! He might, at
least, have put on his best clothes." But he seems wholly
unconscious of her fiery glances, as he makes for a chair,
and poising himself miraculously on one of its legs, begins
to descant to Mr. Martin on the excellence of "them
hosses he sold Snyder."</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>The tall, pale youth, with huge whiskers, who stands
gracefully leaning on the mantel, is Mr. Fustian, a serenader
by profession; at least, I have never heard of his
doing anything else. He has great powers of endurance;
for, I am told, that he thinks nothing of standing two
hours, of a cold night, under Miss Carrol's window,
<i>executing</i> music. Miss Carrol <i>thinks nothing</i> of it, too.
She declares that she sleeps through it all.</p>

<p>Those two somewhat antiquated <i>young ladies</i>, with low
necks and bare arms, whom he is entertaining, or, rather,
who are entertaining him, are the sisters Caroline and Lucy
Bigelow; or, as they call each other, "Carry and Lute."
They affect great juvenility, though nobody remembers
when they were young, and are fond of talking about
"us girls." They have a Brother Peter somewhere in
New England, who, according to their account, is enormously
wealthy, and lives in princely style. "Brother
Peter's establishment" is the constant and almost only
theme of their conversation. "Brother Peter's garden;"
"Brother Peter's conservatory;" "Brother Peter's library;"
in short, everything at Brother Peter's is on so magnificent
a scale, that "Carry" and "Lute" can never see anything
that suits them anywhere else. Even Mrs. Bolton,
who admires their taste and refinement exceedingly, thinks
they have almost too much "fastidium." They occasionally
write, and their articles are always descriptive of something
at "Brother Peter's."</p>

<p>That tall brunette, in black, is Miss Mary Willis. I
never made up my mind that she was handsome, until she
adopted the "French twist," and really looked well in it;
for, certainly, it must be a handsome face that can stand
the test of a coiffure so universally unbecoming. She is a

<!-- page 307 -->

very quiet, retiring girl. Many persons think her proud,
but I do not, and I think that I have penetrated her character
quite thoroughly. If Mary Willis is proud, I could
wish that such pride were contagious.</p>

<p>The thin, <i>peaked</i>-looking woman, to whom Mary is talking,
is Mrs. Stokes. She is a very <i>nice</i> woman&mdash;as the
Timbervillians say. She does not look as if she partook
very largely of the good things which she knows how to
prepare in such perfection, and with which she is always
cramming her friends. As I before remarked, she makes
no pretensions to literary merit herself, but she is a great
admirer of it in others, and praises, indiscriminately, everything
that is produced or read in the circle. She pronounces
all the prose articles "first-rate," and all the
poetry "sublime." Mrs. Bolton has not a very high
opinion of Mrs. Stokes, but hopes that the "sawrees will
be an advantage to her intelleck."</p>

<p>But my letter is already unreasonably long. If you are
at all interested in our society, perhaps I may be able in
my next to give you some specimens of our productions.
And I can scarcely entertain a doubt that you will henceforth
be interested in the sayings and doings of Timberville,
since you know that <i>we</i> are a very important people,
and shall undoubtedly be a city in a few years.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

</div>

<p>TIMBERVILLE.</p>

<p>I AM getting tired of boarding&mdash;there are so many
annoyances connected with it generally. And even
in the best-regulated boarding-houses there is a lack
of that pleasant home-feeling which one has in
housekeeping, even though it be in a hired house. If we
were determined to "locate" (as the Timbervillians say)
permanently in this place, we should have a home of our
own. Until that point is decided, we shall remain with
Mrs. Pratt, for I would rather endure a great many inconveniences
than to be changing about. I have often been
amused at the frivolous causes which drive some persons
from one boarding-house to another. I know one gentleman
who never stays above a month, and seldom as long
as that, at the same house. At one place he had to drink
milk in his tea; he hadn't been used to it, and wouldn't
put up with it. At another, his nose was often offended
at the odor of boiled cabbage; he didn't like cabbage, and
he wouldn't stand it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt's establishment is conducted on the most
economical scale. She understands to perfection the art of
making much of a little. She knows how to "stretch out,"
and make a very small quantity "go a great ways."
She is a widow of some years' standing, but has not yet
ceased to grieve for her worthy husband. She is forever

<!-- page 309 -->

expatiating on his perfections. To hear her talk of him,
you would suppose that all the virtues as well as talents
that were ever created, were united in the person of "poor
Mr. Pratt." The grand object of her life seems to be to
marry off her two daughters, Ann Maria and Philura, a
brace of young ladies who expend upon their fair persons
the products of their mother's thrift, and who appear to
serve no other purpose in the establishment than that of
entertaining the young gentlemen boarders. They never
make their appearance at breakfast, but at dinner they
burst upon us in all their glory, looking as if they had
spent the whole morning at the toilet. They are rather
pretty girls, and with the exercise of a tolerable taste in
dress, would look very well; but they are always arrayed
in showy frocks, gaudy sashes, flaring neck-ribbons, and,
to crown all, some sort of trumpery head-dresses, and all
of different colors, so that it really makes my eyes ache to
look at them. The head-dresses, above all, are my especial
abomination. I can scarcely keep my fingers off them,
they make me so nervous. But they are young ladies to
whom it would not be safe for a plain person like me to
offer a suggestion on the subject of dress. They take but
little notice of me, and make no efforts to render my abode
with them pleasant, but reserve all their attentions for the
young men, who always find them "very easy to get acquainted
with." That part of their time which is not devoted
to dressing, calling and shopping, is spent in drumming
the piano, on which they do great <i>execution</i>, and in
embroidering slippers or netting purses for the gentlemen.</p>

<p>There are, at present, six single gentlemen boarding in
Mrs. Pratt's family&mdash;Mr. Wilkins, a rich old widower,
very cross and very asthmatic,&mdash;an object of tender solicitude

<!-- page 310 -->

to Ann Maria, who takes a vast deal of pains to make
him comfortable, though he does not appear to appreciate
it; Mr. Stivers and Mr. Green, a couple of merchants'
clerks, with nothing remarkable about them excepting
standing collars so stiff that they cannot turn their heads
without turning their bodies also; Mr. Hocum, a lumberman,
who minds his own business and never says anything;
Mr. Bunker, a sort of "Jack at all trades," a dealer in
everything, an inventor of a great variety of useless articles,
for which he gets patents&mdash;he also fills the office of <i>reporter</i>
to the neighborhood, and brings home every day all
the scandal and gossip afloat in the village; and Monsieur
Laborde, a French teacher, full of whims and oddities,
such as rolling his hair in papers over night to make them
curl; exercising his lungs out of his window, to the great
alarm of passers-by; cooking all sorts of ridiculous messes
on the top of the parlor stove; wearing a great many
brown paper soles in his slippers, and spreading them out
on the rug every evening to dry,&mdash;and a hundred other
peculiarities.</p>

<p>Besides the two daughters, Mrs. Pratt has also a son,
a boy of some twelve years old, who, for want of proper
training, had grown to be, when we first came here, a
complete little nuisance. His sisters considered him a
plague and a torment; and his mother declared, with a
rueful shake of the head, that she didn't know what she
should do with Joe, he had got to be so unmanageable&mdash;no
comfort to her at all, so different from what his poor
father was. These lamentations, which were usually delivered
in the boy's presence, did not contribute materially
to his improvement. In fact, he was universally disliked.
The boarders were unanimous in the opinion that he was

<!-- page 311 -->

destitute of one single redeeming quality. He played all
sorts of tricks upon them, and they never passed him without
a kick or an oath. Particularly obnoxious was he to
Monsieur Laborde, who pronounced him "one leetle
diable."</p>

<p>When we came to Mrs. Pratt's we heard so much about
Joe's precocious wickedness that we almost feared to be
under the same roof with him. One morning, a few days
after our arrival, as we were going through the hall to
breakfast, Monsieur rushed from his room just ahead of us,
and with a ferocious aspect, hurried down the stairs. On
his way, he encountered Nancy, the chambermaid, going
up to "regulate."</p>

<p>"Nancie," said he, showing her something in the palm
of his hand, "what you call dis?"</p>

<p>"That," said Nancy, who has a spice of the wag in her
&mdash;"oh, that's a <i>pickaxe</i>."</p>

<p>"Peek-axe," said the Frenchman, throwing it down;
and, as he proceeded, he kept repeating&mdash;"peek-axe,
peek-axe," so as to impress it firmly upon his memory.
When he readied the breakfast-room, where the rest of the
boarders were assembled, and Mrs. Pratt, at the head of
the table, was just beginning to make the coffee, he bounced
in, and without any of his usual French fuss, shouted&mdash;"Madame
Pratt, I have suffer one grand insult! Peek-axe!
Sho have insult me in ma chambre. Peek-axe! It is
one miserable shild, dat Sho."</p>

<p>"The dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Pratt, "what <i>shall</i>
I do with that boy? He'll be the death of me yet. What
<i>has</i> he been doing now?"</p>

<p>"He have insult me ver bad," continued Monsieur. "It
is one leetle diable. If I could keel him, I would be satisfait."</p>

<!-- page 312 -->

<p>"That I should live to see the day!" groaned Mrs.
Pratt. "Pray, what has he done, Mr. Laborde? I'll
punish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have he done?" said the Frenchman. "He
have done plentie, te miserable&mdash;he have trow more as
five hondred peek-axe in te window of ma chambre.
While I shave ma barbe, I understand a noise by the
window; one moment apres, I am couvert de peek-axe."</p>

<p>"Pickaxes!" exclaimed the distressed mother. "Forever
and ever! What would poor Mr. Pratt say?"</p>

<p>"Pickaxes!" cried the gentlemen. "Impossible! It
can't be so!"</p>

<p>"Do you not believe that I say?" demanded Monsieur,
gesticulating violently. "Well, den, come to ma chambre,
and you shall see."</p>

<p>So we all, excepting Mrs. Pratt, whose feelings would
not allow her to move, followed Monsieur to his room,
where we found Nancy, with a dust-pan and wing, busily
engaged in brushing up a quantity of small shot, with which
Joe had besieged the French fortress.</p>

<p>"There," said <i>parlez-vouz</i>, "you can see for yourselve;
peek-axe, plentie peek-axe."</p>

<p>The boarders raised a tremendous roar at Monsieur's expense,
in the midst of which Nancy made a rapid exit.
The Frenchman was furiously angry at being laughed at,
and fearing that something serious might come of it, I retreated
to my own quarters. I believe that only two or
three of the boarders returned to the table, so that Mrs.
Pratt saved a good part of the breakfast to warm up the
next morning.</p>

<p>After this performance, my husband proposed seeking
another boarding-house, as there was no telling how soon

<!-- page 313 -->

Master Joe might begin to play off his pranks upon us.
But I objected to removing, and begged him to leave me to
manage Joe. To tell the truth, I had a sort of sympathy
for the child, to which, perhaps, certain recollections of
my own juvenile experience contributed in some degree.
Be that as it may, I felt a desire to know more of the unpopular
boy, and to discover, if possible, whether there
was any good in him.</p>

<p>A day or two after this affair, at the tea-table, Mr.
Bunker pulled out of his pocket a dirty piece of paper, on
which was scratched, in charcoal, a profile considerably resembling
his own, which is distinguished by a very long
nose and huge whiskers; and holding it up before Mrs.
Pratt, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look o' there, ma'am !&mdash;that's Joe's work! I found
it stuck up on my store, right in plain sight. If that boy
ain't a fit subject for the House of Refuge, I don't know
who is!"</p>

<p>"Forever and ever!" cried Mrs. Pratt. "That I
should live to hear of his doing such a thing! What is
that child a coming to, after all my faithfulness too! Why,
I've wrestled in prayer for him hours together, and a'most
whipped the skin off his back, and all for nothing! What
would his poor father say?" &amp;c.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Pratt was groaning and lamenting, the work
of art was handed round, and elicited various comments
from the beholders. The young ladies declared that, if
they were Mr. Bunker, they wouldn't care a cent about it,
for it didn't look a bit like him.</p>

<p>"I don't care a cent about it," said Bunker; "only I'd
like to have the handling of that boy."</p>

<p>Monsieur, who was still smarting under the <i>pickaxes</i>,

<!-- page 314 -->

pronounced it a "grand insult." But the other young
men, always delighted at a chance to tease one another,
thought it "a pretty fair likeness." "It's Bunker," said
Mr. Stivers; "only <i>more so</i>." "Pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment," said Monsieur,
beginning to relish the joke, and glad of an opportunity
to laugh at Bunker. "Pr&eacute;cisem&eacute;nt&mdash;it is the nose of
Mr. Bunker a leetle more long, and the whiskers of
Mr. Bunker a leetle more big."</p>

<p>Bunker looked as if he wished he had not exhibited the
likeness, since it had been the means of "getting the rig
on him," as they call it here. But he was somewhat
mollified by Mrs. Pratt's assurance that she should punish
Joe severely.</p>

<p>In the evening, my room being very warm, I had thrown
open the door, and sat meditating upon Joe and his performances,
when I heard Mrs. Pratt in the dining-room
dealing with that young gentleman in a most summary
manner; scolding him at a terrible rate, and interspersing
her lecture with frequent cuffs on the ears.</p>

<p>"You miserable young one!" said she. "You'll be
the death of me yet, I know you will&mdash;(cuff)&mdash;you're
all the time a doing something so awful wicked&mdash;(cuff.)
What did you go and make Mr. Bunker's likeness for,
say?"&mdash;(cuff.)</p>

<p>" 'Cause he misused me," said Joe. "He don't treat
me like a human being; and nobody else don't, neither."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't act like a human being," said his
mother, with another cuff; "and you ought not to be
treated like one. What did you want to draw that shameful
profile for&mdash;say?" and she administered three successive
cuffs.</p>

<p>"I tell you I did it because he misused me," said Joe,

<!-- page 315 -->

"He knocked me off his store steps on to the ground,
when I wasn't a doing anything."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'll warrant you wasn't a doing anything,"
said his mother; "you ain't never a doing anything, you
good-for-nothing, lazy, idle little wretch! You'll never
be nobody&mdash;you'll grow up a miserable vagabone! And
what would your poor father say if he knew how you was
a breaking my heart every day?&mdash;(Several cuffs.) So
now, just take off your boots, and go 'long to bed; and if
ever I hear of your drawing any more profiles, I'll give
it to you about east!"</p>

<p>The scolding and the cuffs alike seemed to make no
impression upon Joe. His ears were, doubtless, inured
to both. As he was passing my door on the way to his
own dormitory, I called him. He half paused, and was
going on, when I called him again. He stopped, looked
furtively over his shoulder, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hain't done anything to you, have I?"</p>

<p>Without noticing his question, I repeated, "Come here,
Joe, I want to show you something." He hesitated a moment,
and then, reassured by my countenance, with a look
of bewildered astonishment, advanced into the room. A
new magazine, containing several fine engravings, was
lying by me on the table. I opened it. "Joe," said I,
"I believe you are fond of pictures; here are some good
ones that I think you would like to look at." He came
forward and looked at the plates; but it was some time
before I succeeded, by talking about the engravings and
pointing out their merits, in making him feel at ease. After
he had recovered from his surprise, he became quite interested
in the pictures, rubbed off his dirty fingers on his still
dirtier trowsers, and began to turn over the leaves himself.</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"This book," said he, "looks just like one that Mr.
Green gave Philura; but the pictures are different. She
wouldn't let me look at it, but I got hold of it once when
they'd gone away, and looked at it ever so long, and she
don't know it yet."</p>

<p>"Joe," said I, "you remind me of my nephew Johnny.
You are just about his age and size. Johnny is very fond
of pictures, and he draws them too. Do you ever draw
pictures, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Me!" said Joe. "No, not good ones; I don't know
how."</p>

<p>"Would you like to learn to draw?" said I.</p>

<p>"Gracious! I couldn't learn," said he.</p>

<p>"Why could you not learn?" I asked.</p>

<p>"O because I can't learn anything," replied the child,
with a very decided look.</p>

<p>"Do you go to school?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Not now," said Joe. "I've been to school; but the
master turned me out because, he said, I couldn't learn
anything if he should try to flog it into me till doomsday."</p>

<p>"But would you like to learn to draw if you could?"
asked I.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would most plaguily," replied Joe. "I always
thought I should like to."</p>

<p>I knew the boy's capacity, from the "charcoal sketch"
of Bunker's head, which really possessed a good deal of
character; quite as much as the original&mdash;so I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think you could learn, Joe. If you have a mind to
try, I will teach you."</p>

<p>The child looked up suddenly, and after regarding me a
moment with an expression of wonder, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest, Mrs. Waters?"</p>

<!-- page 317 -->

<p>"Certainly," said I. "I used to like very much to
teach Johnny, and I will be glad to teach you." I then
took from a portfolio one of my drawings, and asked him
if he would like to draw that. It was a rough sketch of
some children and a dog. Joe was delighted with it; and
said he would give anything to know how to make such a
picture. I told him to come to my room every morning,
and I would give him lessons.</p>

<p>"You will though?" said he. "O how I wish I
could come&mdash;but I darsent&mdash;mother'll whale me if I do.
She says I sha'nt go into the boarders' rooms at all."</p>

<p>"But if I invite you she'll not object, will she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Joe, shaking his head, sorrowfully.
"I guess she'd whale me anyhow; but no matter
if she does&mdash;I'm used to whalin'."</p>

<p>"O no, Joe," said I; "if your mother were really unwilling,
I would not have you come on any account. But
I think that if I ask her permission to teach you, she will
grant it. I shall go down presently and speak to her
about it; and if she consents, you may come in to-morrow
morning at ten o'clock. And remember, Joe, you must
have very clean hands, so as not to soil the paper&mdash;Johnny
was always particular to wash his hands very clean
when he was going to draw. And now you may go to
bed. Good-night, Joe."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mrs. Waters," said Joe. "I hope
mother'll say I may come."</p>

<p>After Joe had retired, I went down stairs and spoke to
Mrs. Pratt. I told her that I thought Joe had quite a
turn for drawing, and with her permission I would like to
give him lessons. She was rather alarmed at first, and
said that she wasn't in the habit of taking anything but

<!-- page 318 -->

money for board. But when I assured her that it was for
pleasure, not for pay, that I wished to teach Joe, the matter
assumed quite a different aspect in her eye, though her
astonishment was evidently increased. She freely consented,
though she could not imagine what pleasure it would
afford me to try to teach such a child as Joe. She never
could do anything with him. She was completely discouraged
about him. It was the strangest thing in the
world, too, that he wasn't a better boy, considering how
faithful she'd been to him. Nobody could say he had been
ruined by indulgence. Very true, nobody could.</p>

<p>As I was returning to my room, I perceived the form of
Joe emerging from a small passage at the end of the hall.
He was <i>partially disrobed</i>, (as the novels say), and holding
up his trowsers with both hands.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" inquired he, eagerly.</p>

<p>"She says that you may come," I replied.</p>

<p>"Good!" shouted Joe, clapping his hands, quite forgetful
of the office they were performing. "Good!&mdash;then
she can't whale me; and when I <i>can</i> get along without
being whaled, I'd rather."</p>

<p>The next morning, at ten o'clock precisely, came Joe,
with a pair of hands that fairly shone from the effects of
the scouring which he had given them.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Joe," said I; "I'm glad to see you
punctual: a great deal depends upon punctuality."</p>

<p>It was a rare thing for poor Joe to be praised, and his
eyes sparkled with pleasure. To shorten my narrative,
Joe's progress in drawing was rapid beyond my anticipations;
never was pupil more docile. Gradually, I added
a few more branches, and he has entered with alacrity into
every study that I proposed, though he seems to prefer

<!-- page 319 -->

drawing to anything else. Unbounded was the astonishment
of his worthy mother at my success. She wished
that <i>poor</i> Mr. Pratt was alive to see it. The boarders too,
when they had discovered that I had taken Joe under my
patronage, ceased to abuse him, and he has consequently
left off his annoying tricks. Even Monsieur allows that
there is a "grand changement in Sho." And I find the
hour which I daily devote to him more than repaid by the
affection of the hitherto neglected child for me&mdash;his first
friend&mdash;the first one who taught him that he was neither
a fool nor a wretch. In short, Mrs. Pratt begins to think
that her faithfulness will be rewarded, her prayers will be
answered, and that Joe will be something after all.</p>

<p>Evening&mdash;Mary Willis has sent me this afternoon a
little piece for our next literary circle. I am one of the
appointed readers for the occasion, and Mary is too diffident
to read her own productions. Here is an extract
from it:</p>

<p>"I love to be alone&mdash;alone in the morning with the
trees, and the flowers, and the birds. I am not alone
then&mdash;they are all so friendly to me, and talk more
kindly with me than any human friend. The waving
trees whisper to me. The flowers turn up their bright
faces pleasantly to greet me. And the sweet birds seem
to be singing solely for my pleasure.</p>

<p>"I love to be alone in the night&mdash;alone with the
clouds, and the stars, and the beautiful moon. The wondrous
stars! how gently they look down on me. The
clouds, too&mdash;they are for me so many good and wonderful
sermons, full of ever new and ever varying thoughts.
Often I watch them gradually folding, leaf after leaf, over
the face of the moon in soft and dreamy beauty. But

<!-- page 320 -->

darker and heavier they grow, till her light is completely
hidden; and I watch and wait in the darkness and long to
see again the face of the fair planet.</p>

<p>"Thus, often the joys and the loves of earth come between
us and the haven on which our eyes should ever be fixed.
Very beautiful they are at first, like the light clouds before
the moon, and the face of our Father is not wholly hidden
from us. But gradually they fill our vision. They shut
out the light of the better world, and we are left in darkness,
to grieve and think how much dearer than all earthly
delights is one ray from the Sun of Righteousness."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolton, also, has sent me an article for the circle,
accompanied by a note, saying, that, "my distinct enunciation
would enable me to do better justice to her production
than she could herself." I will give it to you entire,
as I know she would not object to being "extensively perused."</p>

<p>"How delightful to the satiated mind in an ungenial
soil is converse with a kindred literary spirit! This
remark is promulgated by the recollection of a circumstance
which transpired to me once while I was sojourning at
Saratoga Springs for the establishment of my health, which
had become undermined by excessive reading.</p>

<p>"It was on a resplendent day in August, that I was
meandering in a delicious grove of pines in the vicinity of
Congress Spring, when I perceived converging towards me
a tall and elegant young man, with a rifle under his arm.
When he perceived the fair occupant of the forest, he
bowed gracefully and was diverging onwards. But being
excessively struck with his highly intellectual countenance,
I was desirous of entering into conversation with him, and
remarked&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 321 -->

<p>" 'Seeing you, sir, with your rifle in hand amid this
wilderness of trees, reminds me forcibly of that celebrated
line of Shakspeare&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">" 'Just as the trigger's bent, the tree's inclined.' "</p>

<p>"He paused, and regarded me with evident astonishment.
It was obvious that I was the first <i>literati</i> he had
met at the Springs. After a moment he smiled, and remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'And I am here, as the same poet farther observes&mdash;

<p class="small">" 'To teach the young idea how to shoot.' "</p>

<p>"From this commencement, our conversation very naturally
fell into a highly intellectual strain. I never was
more delighted, and the bewitching stranger appeared
equally so. He drew out my conversational powers on a
great variety of subjects. I think I was never more animated.
I talked enthusiastically of my favorite authors,
and he asked me a multitude of questions&mdash;I regret that
I disremember the most of them at this remote period.
His conversation clearly evinced that he was deeply imbrued
with a poetic temperature. He was evidently
quite carried away with me, and actually laughed outright
several times in his delight at encountering an individual
of a kindred spirit. He repeated several stanzas of exquisite
poetry, highly complimentary to me, which were
evidently suggested impromptu on the spur of the moment.
Our interview was prolonged until the concentrating shades
of evening warned us to return to our respective abodes.
When we reached the 'United States Hotel,' he bowed
with superhuman grace, and was turning to ascend the

<!-- page 322 -->

piazza, when I remarked that it would be a source of intense
satisfaction to me to possess his card. He turned
his refulgent eyes upon me, and laying the forefinger of
his right hand gracefully beside his nasal organ, said, with
an expression which I shall never forget, 'Madam, I am
incog.' And bowing again with redoubled elegance, he
receded up the long vista of the piazza. I had never beheld
the unknown literati since; but I have always labored
under a firm persuasion that he was none other than a well
known celebrated poet."</p>

<p>I fear greatly that I cannot "do justice" to Mrs. Bolton's
article. I have half a mind to get up a cold and sore
throat for the occasion, which will enable me to decline the
honor. But in that case I must decline Mary's too.
What shall I do? I'm in a quandary.</p>

<p>Joe and I are going to have a fine ramble over the hills
this evening. He is waiting for me on the piazza below,
and I know, by a sort of shuffling stamp which he is performing,
that he begins to grow impatient. So I'll e'en
close my long-enough letter and relieve him.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

</div>

<p>TIMBERVILLE.</p>

<p>I KNOW you will pardon my long silence, when
you learn the important fact that I am at house-keeping.
If you have experienced the trials and
vexations which usually attend the setting up of
an establishment, surely I shall have your hearty sympathy.
But I do not believe you know anything about
the enormity of such an undertaking in the country. In
the city, you are free from a thousand annoyances and
hindrances, which we have to endure in a place like Timberville,
busy, bustling, noisy, and growing; a place
neither city nor country, but, as it were, in a state of <i>betweenity</i>,
aping the former, yet possessing many of the
peculiarities of the latter, but in nothing resembling those
old-fashioned, stationary country villages, in one of which
I had the happiness to be born and reared. Dear old
Greenvalley! It has been in appearance just what it now
is, ever since my earliest recollection. There was undoubtedly
a time when it was new and growing, but that
time has faded from the memory of man. The only external
changes which I remark, as I return from time to
time to the peaceful shade of its majestic old elms, are,
that here and there a roof has been newly shingled, a
fence repaired, and occasionally an entire house has gone

<!-- page 324 -->

up in the place of one that had fallen quite to decay.
One by one, the white-haired patriarchs of the hamlet have
been gathered to their final rest, while those of their descendants
who have caught this age's restless spirit of
adventure, have gone to "seek their fortunes" elsewhere.
Only such remain as are content to pursue the tranquil
tenor of their fathers' way. Heaven forbid that Greenvalley
should ever "take a start and grow."</p>

<p>Here, there is no such thing as doing anything quietly.
The whole village must know all your proceedings; everybody
must "have a hand in it;" and unless you receive
with a good grace the proffered assistance, you are forever
undone. I resolved to take warning from the unhappy
fate of a certain Mrs. D., who came here to reside about
two years ago, and not render myself unpopular, as she
had done. Unfortunate woman! She declined the officious
offers of the Timberville ladies, to help her "get to
rights," and chose rather, with the assistance of the members
of her own household, to fit her carpets herself, arrange
her furniture, and, what was the most aggravating
of all, to unpack her trunks and bureaus, without so much
as allowing any of the aforesaid ladies a peep at their contents.
Mrs. Philpott, animadverting to me upon Mrs.
D.'s conduct, remarked, "We don't know to this day
what was in them boxes."</p>

<p>As I did not desire the reputation of being "stuck up,"
I surrendered, with apparent cheerfulness, my house and
furniture to the mercy of some ten or dozen of the Timberville
ladies, for the space of about a week. My husband
retreated in alarm from the scene of action, and
remained quietly at Mrs. Pratt's, until the house was pronounced
to be "to rights." Joe Pratt said he thought it

<!-- page 325 -->

might with more propriety be called <i>to wrongs</i>; a very
just remark of Joe's; for actually we were occupied a full
week longer in undoing the greater part of what the ladies
had done. Everything had to be re-arranged. The carpets,
which they had insisted upon making, had been
sewed together in such a manner that the seams burst
open and the bindings gave out during the process of
nailing down, which was accomplished so crookedly, that
one would have imagined every person who assisted thereat
to have differed from the rest in her opinion respecting the
manner in which they ought to lie. Of course, they had
all to be taken up, re-sewed, and put down straight.</p>

<p>But, after the siege which the house had undergone, I
thought I had reason to congratulate myself that the destruction
of property had been no greater than it was.
When they unpacked the crockery, and I saw half-a-dozen
pulling and hauling at it, I certainly expected to see it
nearly all go to pieces. Consequently, I was thankful to
escape with the loss of a few pieces of china, just enough
to spoil a set, the demolition of a large lamp-shade, which
Mrs. Harris had smashed in her eagerness to draw it from
its concealment, and the ruination of a valuable framed engraving,
which Mrs. Bolton (our <i>literati</i>) accidentally
dashed against the corner of the stove, thereby breaking
the glass into numberless atoms, and bursting a hole
through the middle of the picture. The good lady fancied
that she made more than ample compensation by sending
me the next day a daub of a painting&mdash;a couple of
women leading a donkey, and two or three huts in the distance.
She accompanied this gift with a note, wherein
she stated that the painting was one of a number which
she had recently purchased in Philadelphia; it was "a

<!-- page 326 -->

view of Switzerland, an oriental village near Paris;" Mr.
Milligan, the great traveller whom she had met in the city,
pronounced it to be a perfect representation.</p>

<p>During the readjustment of affairs, my friend, Joe
Pratt, was very useful to us. The little fellow was constantly
on hand, ready to assist in a thousand ways. We
continued to take our meals at his mother's, until everything
was arranged at our new abode. When, finally,
that time arrived, and I said, "Well, Joe, I believe we
are all fixed at last," the poor boy looked anything but
pleased. He would no longer have any excuse for running
back and forth. He must stay all day at home, with
no relief from his mother's fretfulness and his sisters' rebuffs.
His daily visits to my room, his lessons, and our
pleasant rambles together, they must all be given up, and
Joe was sad.</p>

<p>"Joe," said I, reading his thoughts, "I shall miss you
very much."</p>

<p>"And I shall be <i>so</i> lonesome," said he, stretching his
eyes open very wide, to prevent the tears from running
out; "and mother talks of moving away to Ohio, too,
and then I shall never see you again."</p>

<p>The idea of parting with Joe was painful to me; for I
had become greatly attached to him. A thought struck
me of keeping him with us. I, however, said nothing to
Joe about it at that time, wishing first to consult my husband
on the subject. When Mr. Waters came in I mentioned
it to him; he approved the plan; and we accordingly
proposed to Mrs. Pratt, that, in case of her removing
from Timberville, she should leave Joe with us for at least
a year or two. At first, the worthy woman did not appear
much inclined to accede to the proposal, and dwelt

<!-- page 327 -->

with great emphasis upon the pain of parting with her
only son. But as soon as she fairly understood that we
wished to relieve her from all expense on his account, her
feelings underwent a modification; her objections vanished,
and she consented. And so it is settled. Mrs.
Pratt is to remove to Ohio next month, accompanied by
her daughters, and Joe is to come and live with us; an
arrangement highly satisfactory to that young gentleman.</p>

<p>The greatest trouble which I have experienced thus far
in housekeeping here, has arisen from the difficulty of
procuring servants that are good for anything. During
the first two months I had <i>four</i> different ones. Our first
specimen in this line was a girl from the wilds of Pennsylvania,
whom Mrs. Stokes procured for me, and pronounced
to be "excellent help." She rejoiced in the
euphonious cognomen of "Rowena Ruggles." I had been
expecting her for several days, but she did not come until
the second evening after we were settled in our new home.
Her approach was announced by the rattling of a very noisy
lumber wagon, which stopped in the middle of the road
in front of our house. I looked up and beheld an over-grown,
raw-boned girl, accompanied by a gawky boy who
drove. The girl was seated on a huge pine box. She
rose up in the vehicle, and, after taking a comprehensive
view of the house, exclaimed: "Wal, I guess this ere's
the sittiwation. Jeems, I'll hold the horse, while you git
out and go see'f the Waterses lives here, if they do, you
tell 'em that Miss Ruggles has arriv'." Just then a boy,
who was passing, gave them the desired information, and
the girl alighted and came in. She entered the front door
without taking the slightest notice of the bell, and walked

<!-- page 328 -->

into the parlor where I was sitting. "How do ye do?"
said she; then casting herself down on the sofa with native
ease and freedom of manner, remarked: "This is
Miss Waters, ain't it?" I assented. "Wal, I'm Miss
Ruggles," said she, "the young lady you was suspectin'."
After communicating this piece of intelligence, she took
off her tawdry pink silk bonnet, and white gauze long
shawl, and, laying them on the centre-table, inquired:
"Hain't you no men folks round? I guess Jeems'll want
some resistance about fetchin' in my chist." But she underrated
Jeems's abilities, for at that moment he came dragging
up the steps the enormous pine box.</p>

<p>Having, by this time, recovered in a measure from the
astonishment into which the unceremonious entrance of Miss
Ruggles had thrown me, I advanced and met the young
gentleman in the hall, and, having directed him where
to bestow his sister's box, returned to the parlor and requested
Rowena to bring her bonnet and shawl, and I
would show her where her room was. She complied;
and, on the way, inquired "whether we'd been to supper?"
I answered in the affirmative; whereupon she informed
me that she "hadn't had none; and Jeems would
want some 'fore he went back with the surveyance." I
got them supper, after which Jeems returned home; and,
after giving Rowena some instructions in regard to her
work, I retired with some misgivings, and left her to wash
up the dishes.</p>

<p>Upon further acquaintance with Miss Ruggles, I discovered
that she understood housework much better than I
at first supposed. She could bake, and wash, and do
plain cooking very well; but her notions of equality, and
her utter ignorance of the proprieties of her station, rendered

<!-- page 329 -->

it very difficult to get on with her. She seemed to
expect me to be in the kitchen at work as long as she was
there, though in our little family there was not enough
work to occupy nearly all of her own time. Every afternoon,
she arrayed herself in a very stiffly starched petticoat,
and blue muslin dress, and "joined me in the parlor"
(as novels say). Her dress, which fastened in the back,
she could only hook a little way up, so she bawled out, as
she entered, "Miss Waters, I'll get you to hook up my
frock." After I had performed this service for her, she
was wont to complete her toilet before the parlor glass.
After having adjusted a broad, yellow ribbon around her
neck, put on a pair of lace cuffs decorated with pink bows,
and stuck an immense red and green plaid rosette in her
mud-colored hair, she threw herself on the sofa; or, if I
did not happen to be occupying it, in my large rocking-chair,
and bewail to converse without restraint. She generally
entertained me with an account of the various
"ways" of the various ladies with whom she had lived,
occasionally diversified with remarks like the following:
"I like the way you do up your hair, Miss Waters. I
guess I'll git you to fix mine for me some time. I ain't
no great hand to do up hair myself. Sister Batsey&mdash;she's
married a Brigham now, and live to the Flatts out
here&mdash;<i>she's</i> quite a hand to do up hair; hern's a'most as
black as your'n. That frock o' your'n looks jest like one
Batsey's got; shouldn't wonder if 'twas off the same piece.
What did you hef to give a yard for that?"</p>

<p>No matter what I was doing,&mdash;reading, writing, whatever
might be my occupation,&mdash;it was no check upon Miss
Ruggles's volubility. It was a dreadful annoyance, and I
resolved to get rid of it; but not liking to offend her by

<!-- page 330 -->

telling her that I would prefer her "room to her company,"
I tried various expedients to induce her to spend
the afternoon elsewhere. I offered her useful books to
read in her own room; but she "wa'n't no hand for
books." I discovered, on investigation, that she could
barely spell out a few words, and had never learned to
write at all. I offered to teach her, and told her that I
had a spare writing-desk, which she might keep in her
room and practise every afternoon. But she declined,
saying that "she didn't see no use o' much eddication;
her brother Brigham was eddicated, and that answered for
'em all." I asked if she had no sewing that she would
like to do, and hinted that her room possessed great conveniences
for such employment. But "she wa'n't no
hand to sew; sister Batsey generally made her things for
her." At length my patience was exhausted, when, on
returning one evening with Mr. Waters from a walk, we
found Rowena in the parlor, seated in my rocking-chair,
with her feet on an ottoman, my Cologne bottle in her
hand, and playing the hostess to Monsieur Laborde, Mr.
Griffin, and Mr. Bunker, who had called upon us. The
gentlemen had evidently been highly entertained with her
easy manners and conversational powers. I was thoroughly
vexed, and told her emphatically to leave the room.
Her surprise was equalled only by her indignation. She
went out in high dudgeon, slamming the door behind her,
to the great amusement of the gentlemen. M. Laborde
remarked that "Miss Roogle was very <i>divertissante</i>." Her
proceedings were anything but amusing to me, whatever
they might have been to Monsieur and his companions.</p>

<p>When Rowena retreated from the parlor, she went out,
by way of compensation, to call upon Mrs. Crandal, the

<!-- page 331 -->

baker's wife, our next door neighbor, with whom she had
struck up an intimacy, and to whom she carried a daily report
of "Miss Waters's curus ways." No doubt she
received that lady's sincerest sympathy in her affliction,
and probably acted upon her advice; for the next morning,
as Mr. Waters and I were sitting in the library, she
came in abruptly and demanded her wages. It was
Thursday. I had hitherto paid her on Saturdays.</p>

<p>"Why do you want your money to-day, Rowena?"
asked I.</p>

<p>"Because I'm a goin' to go," said she, angrily.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Rowena?" said I. "Why are
you going off so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Pay her, Fanny, and let her go," said my husband,
who is decidedly opposed to "having words" with servants.</p>

<p>I therefore went to a drawer and got the money for her.
But Miss Ruggles was not disposed to depart without a
few last words.</p>

<p>"I'm a goin'," said she, "acause you've made an underlin'
of me ever sence I come here. You hain't axed
me to set down to the table and take a meal o' vittels with
ye onct; and Miss Crandal's help allers eats to the table
with 'em, and Miss Crandal's as good as you be, any day;
and she says it's an impersition; and my sister Batsey
lived a year and a half to Squire Huger's, to the Flatts,
and she allers eat to the table with 'em; and they was respectabler'n
you be, and lived in enough sight grander
house. And then, to cap all, you told me I wa'n't wanted
in t'other room last night, and I ain't a goin' to put up
with it no longer; and <i>so</i>&mdash;and you may git yer work did
the best way ye ken, for all I care."</p>

<!-- page 332 -->

<p>Having thus relieved her mind, she retired, banging all
the doors, and knocking down several chairs in her exit.
In the afternoon, Jeems came with the <i>surveyance</i> and took
away her <i>chist</i>. A few days after her departure, my husband
received by mail the following note, the production
of her <i>eddicated</i> brother-in-law.</p>

SILAS BRIGHAM.</p>

<p>On the evening after Rowena left in disgust, Joe Pratt
came round to see me, and he undertook to procure us
another girl. He knew, he said, one Polly Baily, who
had occasionally worked at his mother's when they had a
great deal of company. He believed she was not very
<i>bright</i>, but he knew her to be good-natured. She was
now out of a place, and lived at a brother's. I thought I
would at least make a trial of her. I therefore desired
Joe to go and tell her to come to me for a few days. He
readily complied, and soon returned with the information
that Polly would be over in the morning. She would
have come with him, but she wanted to mend her things
and make a new calico apron that evening.</p>

<p>The next morning, while I was preparing breakfast,

<!-- page 333 -->

Polly arrived. She came in at the back door, and hailed
me with&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Good</i> morning Miss Waters. I s'pose that's you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "and I suppose you are Polly Baily?"</p>

<p>" 'Tain't nobody else," said she, depositing a small
bundle on the table and taking off her bonnet, exhibiting
thereby a most unique coiffure. Her hair, which was very
thin, was all drawn together at the summit of her head,
tied with a tape string, and twisted into a funny little pig-tail.
In person, Miss Baily was short and stout, her eyes
were set <i>bias</i> in her head, and her mouth was entirely on
one side of her face. If she lacked the dignity and stateliness
of her predecessor, Miss Ruggles, she fully equalled
that young lady in ease and self-possession.</p>

<p>"I should a come last night," continued she, "only
my things needed mendin' and fixin', and I had a new calicer
apron to make. You see, sister-in-law's baby's ben
sick, and I've had so much to do, I hain't had a minnit's
time to sew lately. But I didn't git at the apron last
night, after all, for sister-in-law went to meetin', and the
baby waked up and cried, and I had to tend it till she got
back. So I fetcht my apron along: s'pose I shall git any
time to make it here?"</p>

<p>"O, yes," replied I; "you will have some time to
yourself every afternoon, unless something unusual happens;
and you will find a drawer in the table in your
room, where you can keep your work."</p>

<p>"Wal, if that ain't clever!" exclaimed Polly. "I
shouldn't wonder if you was a goin' to be a real good
woman to live with; though Miss Crandal says"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is nearly breakfast-time, Polly," I said; "there
are some mutton steaks to be broiled: do you know how
to do them?"</p>

<!-- page 334 -->

<p>"Pity if I don't," she answered. "It takes me to
cook mutton steaks. Why, when I lived to Miss"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, here is the gridiron; the coffee is already boiling,
and will soon be done. Do you understand making
coffee?"</p>

<p>"Pity if I don't! Why, I've made coffee ever sence I
was <i>so</i> high. Jest tell me where things <i>is</i>, and I can go
ahead, as you'll find out 'fore I've lived with ye long. I
ain't afeard but what I shall suit ye; everybody that has
me once wants me agin."</p>

<p>So I gave her the necessary information, and telling her
to ring the bell when breakfast was on the table, was going
out, when she called to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Waters! I've heerd say how't you don't have
your help eat to the table with you; is it so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Polly," said I; "I always allow my girls the
privilege of eating by themselves; they feel so much more
at liberty to eat as much as they want, you know."</p>

<p>"Wal, now, ther is something in that," said Polly.
"And don't you take off none o' the vittels after you git
through?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; the girls always have the same that
Mr. Waters and I have."</p>

<p>"Wal, I say for't; I don't see why that ain't a good
idee. Miss Crandal needn't jaw about it as she does; for,
after all, it's enough better'n the way she manages. I
lived there a spell once, and I used to eat to the table with
'em, and, it's a fact, I was half starved; for she used to
be forever tellin' the children 'twa'n't perlite to take anything
mor'n once, and so ye see I darsen't do it; and then,
the minnit they got through, she ketcht off the vittels and
stuck 'em away under lock and key."</p>

<!-- page 335 -->

<p>"I am glad you are satisfied with my arrangements,
Polly," said I, escaping from the kitchen, and rejoicing at
having thus disposed of one grand difficulty.</p>

<p>But that breakfast! The mutton steaks were burnt to
a coal, and quite uneatable. And the coffee! what could
be the matter with it? At the first taste of it, Mr.
Waters turned pale with consternation, and rushed to the
door to "make restitution" of it (as M. Laborde says).
I took a sip, and was obliged to follow his example. I
never tasted anything so perfectly horrible. I called
Polly, and asked her what she had done to the coffee.</p>

<p>"Why, nothin'," said she; "only, when I took it up,
I throw'd in a tablespoonful o' salt to settle it."</p>

<p>I went out and made a cup of tea, not daring to trust
Polly to do it; and this, with the bread, which was cut in
pieces an inch thick at one end, and slivered up as thin as
a wafer at the other, constituted our breakfast. Mr.
Waters thought it but a sorry beginning for our new functionary;
but I told him that these were evils which, with
proper training, could, I hoped, soon be remedied. I
spent the whole morning in instructing Polly, giving her
the minutest directions about everything in her department
of labor; in fact, doing all that related to the preparation
of dinner myself, in order to show her how I wished
it done; while she kept constantly asserting that "she
<i>know'd</i>&mdash;she'd always been used to <i>doing</i>&mdash;but then
everybody liked their own ways best, and she was perfectly
willin' to be teacht my ways, for she wanted to suit
me," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>After dinner I was in the library, when Polly came
bolting in, with a look of extreme satisfaction on her face,
and holding in each hand a broken tumbler; the bottoms
were gone.</p>

<!-- page 336 -->

<p>"Look o' there, Miss Waters!" she said. "Ain't you
astonished?"</p>

<p>"I am, indeed. How did you break those, Polly?"</p>

<p>"O, law!" said she, "that ain't <i>it</i>. I mean, ain't you
astonished to see me come and tell on't? 'Tain't 'every
girl 'twould own up so when they broke a thing; but <i>I do;</i>
you won't never ketch <i>me</i> a breakin' crockery and then
stickin' on't away, out o' yer sight. I'm honest, as you'll
find out 'fore I've lived with ye long."</p>

<p>On inquiry, I found that she had poured boiling water
on the tumblers to wash them. I told her never to do so
again; though, at the same time, I commended her honesty
in telling me of the accident. After she had got the
kitchen "to rights," she came again.</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Waters, the work's all did up now; and
I'm ready to go at that apron, if you'll lend me a needle
and some thread; I didn't think to fetch none."</p>

<p>I furnished her with these requisites, and she retired to
her room. When it was nearly time for tea, she came
running in again, quite out of breath, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't ye think, Miss Waters, I hain't took a stitch in
that apron yet!"</p>

<p>"Why, Polly," said I, "how comes that? I thought
you had been sewing these two hours."</p>

<p>"Wal, that was what I meant to do," replied Polly;
"but, ye see, I hadn't more'n got seated by my winder,
ready to go at it, when Miss Crandal she spied me from
her parlor winder, and she called to me to come over there;
so I throwd down my work, ye know, and went over to see
what she wanted, and there I've ben ever sence; and Miss
Capers and Miss Bennet was there a visitin', you know
and they all three sot to and axed me more'n forty

<!-- page 337 -->

thousand questions about you, and all how I got along here,
and what wages I got, and whether I eat to the table with
you. I told 'em no; I had the privilege of eatin' by
myself, without bein' watched every mou'ful I took, and I
told 'em I had enough to eat, too; and a real nice room,
besides, to sleep in, with a good clean bed, and a table,
and a lookin'-glass in it. That made Miss Crandal feel
rather shamed, I guess; fur when I lived there, I had to
sleep up garret, in an old trundle-bed, you know, right
where all the old truck was kept, you know," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>My hopes of Polly's improvement were doomed to be
disappointed; for I found it utterly impossible to impress
anything upon her mind. She could not remember from
one hour to the next, much less from one day to another.
Daily and hourly did I go through with the same process
of training and directing. Daily and hourly did Polly protest
that "she <i>would</i> remember <i>that</i> time, I'd see 'f she
wouldn't," and as constantly did she continue to make the
very same blunders over and over again. She would actually
have salted the coffee again the second morning, if I
had not discovered her intention in time to prevent such a
catastrophe. And the tumblers would have been broken
every day, had I not superintended the dish-washing.</p>

<p>The day after she came, the fastidious sisters Bigelow
(Carry and Lute) called upon me. I had just gone up
stairs to dress, having been engaged longer than usual with
my household duties, by reason of Polly's awkwardness.
My maid of all work answered the summons of the bell,
and admitted the ladies with a very vociferous "Why,
girls, how <i>do</i> you <i>do?</i> Come in."</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Waters at home?" said Miss Carry, with
great dignity.</p>

<!-- page 338 -->

<p>"O yes; she's to hum," responded Polly; "she's jest
went up stairs to put on her t'other things. You step in
the parlor; take some cheers; now take off yer things."
The ladies declined. "What, can't ye stay? I know
Miss Waters would like to hev you, and I'm sure <i>I</i> should."</p>

<p>"Carry our names to Mrs. Waters," said Miss Bigelow,
commandingly.</p>

<p>"Your names!" said Polly, "less see, they're <i>Carline</i>
and <i>Lucy</i>, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"Tell her the Miss Bigelows are here," replied Carry,
with a great accession of dignity to her tone and manner.</p>

<p>Polly was puzzled; but, without asking further questions,
she came to the foot of the stairs, which is close to
the parlor door, and bawled out to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Waters! the Miss Bigl'ows is here. They told
me to tell you their names&mdash;I b'l'eve they're Carline and
Lucy. They hain't come to stay to tea; so you hurry and
come down as quick as you kin."</p>

<p>I was distracted! I rushed out half dressed, and, bending
over the banister&mdash;</p>

<p>"Polly," said I, "don't stay there any longer. I'll be
down in a moment."</p>

<p>"O law," replied the pertinacious Polly, "I'd jest as
lives stay with 'em till you git ready as not."</p>

<p>So she returned to the parlor, and entertained the ladies
with an account of the advantages of her new place; and I,
knowing that to call to her again would only prolong the
ridiculous scene, finished dressing with all possible expedition
and hastened down, whereupon Polly withdrew, without
waiting to be sent, saying, "she guessed she'd go at
that apron now." I apologized to the ladies for Polly's ignorance,
and said that I hoped to be able to teach her

<!-- page 339 -->

something in the course of time. Miss Bigelow trusted
that I would succeed in the attempt. Miss Lute remarked
that such scenes were excessively annoying, and they both
declared that the impertinence of the Timberville servants
was quite intolerable to them, particularly after being at
Brother Peter's, where the domestics were under such perfect
control, notwithstanding their number. They then
went into a highly edifying description of the domestic
economy of brother Peter's establishment, which occupied
the remainder of the visit.</p>

<p>After they had gone, I spent an hour in teaching Polly
her duty on such occasions. She promised faithfully to observe
my directions. The next day, Judge Conway and
Mrs. Conway called; and Polly, will you believe it?
went through with the very same performance which she
had enacted with the Bigelows! She was incorrigible, but
so really desirous to please me, that I was unwilling to
give her up until I had taxed my ingenuity to the utmost
to make something of her. But it was a fruitless task, she
could not remember; unless I was with her all the time,
everything went wrong. I kept her two weeks, and then
gave up in despair. The poor girl felt very badly when I
told her that I must discharge her. She said "she liked
me better than anybody she had ever lived with; if I would
only keep her, she <i>would</i> remember my <i>ways</i> and try to suit
me." But I knew too well her utter incapacity to fulfil
this promise to trust to her good intentions. One source
of regret with Polly at leaving me was, that "she hadn't
finished 'that apron' yet, and she shouldn't have a minute's
time to sew at her sister-in-law's." You can therefore
imagine her delight when I presented her a black silk apron,
ready made, and her ecstasy at the addition of a collar and
pair of cuffs to this gift.</p>

<!-- page 340 -->

<p>"Why, Miss Waters!" said she, "you don't mean to
give me these right out and out, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Polly," I replied.</p>

<p>"And ain't they 'ducted from my wages?"</p>

<p>"By no means; they are a present; and here is your
money, too."</p>

<p>"Wal, I say for't!" exclaimed she, "you be a clever
woman and no mistake! I'll show these to Miss Crandal,
you see 'f I don't. She used to make me take mor'n half
my wages in old clus."</p>

<p>In real Timberville style, I am boring you to death with
a history of my "helps." I will not enter into any more
particulars on this inexhaustible theme, but merely state
that of the two whom I have tried since Polly's departure,
the first was a thievish, intemperate Irish woman, whom I
dismissed at the end of a week; and the last, a lazy, saucy
black girl, of whom you may form a correct idea by this
remark of hers. She one day saw two of our most respectable
citizens taking a drunken, black rioter to jail.
"Miss Waters," said she, "what you s'pose dem two
white fellers is gwine to do wid dat colored gent?" This
sable functionary " 'eluded to trabel," and accordingly set
out a few weeks ago for Avon Springs. Since then I have
been without a domestic, and, by dint of putting out the
washing, and having "old Sammy," an honest, faithful
negro man, to come every morning and "do up the
chores," I am getting on very well&mdash;nay, I enjoy it thoroughly.
In fact, I did not know the extent of my own
powers, until necessity forced the discovery upon me; and
as every day strengthens my confidence in my own abilities,
and my husband declares that he never was so happy in
his life, I think I shall give myself no further trouble about
"helps," as long as we reside at Timberville.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crandal, having now no other means of espionage,
has struck up a back-door acquaintance with me; and, I
believe, begins to think me not so proud, after all, since I
am willing to "take right hold and do" myself. She actually
brought in to me, yesterday, a present of some very
nice "turnpike cakes," (did you ever hear of them
before?) to raise bread with, and also gave me directions
for using them, which I intend to put into practice next
baking-day.</p>

<p>But there comes Mary Willis. The dear girl's frequent
and unceremonious visits constitute a great share of my
enjoyment. I have but lately learned something of Mary's
early history. I intend to give it to you at some future
time; perhaps in my next.</p>

<h2>AUNT MAGWIRE'S ACCOUNT</h2>

<p>OF THE</p>

<h1>MISSION TO MUFFLETEGAWNY.</h1>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I'VE ben very lonesome lately. Jefferson's gone off
to attend lecters, and I sha'n't see nothin' of him in
several months; but one thing comforts me: when
he comes back, I guess it'll be for good. He's about
made up his mind to settle down here, and everybody
thinks he'll do well here a doctorin'. There ain't but one
person that's advised him to leave Scrabble Hill, and that's
Samson Savage. He met Jeff one day when he was home
last, and he says, to him in his patronizin' way, "Well,
young man, they say you've nearly finished your studies.
Where do you calcilate to locate?"</p>

<p>"I've about concluded to stick out a shingle here," says
Jeff.</p>

<p>"What!" says Mr. Savage, says he, "you surprise
me! Why, you'd be a born fool to do that&mdash;a born fool,
take my word for it!"</p>

<p>"Why?" says Jeff. "Don't you think I'll succeed
here?"</p>

<p>"As to that matter," says Mr. Savage, "I s'pose you'll

<!-- page 346 -->

do well enough here in p'int of practice, but you'll always
be called Jeff to your dyin' day, if you stay here."</p>

<p>"That is rather aggravatin'," says Jeff, "but I guess I
must grin and bear it, and depend on posterity to do me
justice."</p>

<p>"Hang posterity!" says Mr. Savage; "now's the
present time."</p>

<p>I'm very glad Jeff don't take a notion to go clear off
to Californy, or some other place away out of the land of
the livin'; 'twould nigh about kill me if he should. The
fact is, he'd rather be with his father and mother than
anywhere else, and he's a genniwine comfort to us. Most
folks think he'll get a good run of practice here after a
spell. Dr. Pratt's gittin' old, and Dr. Tinkom ain't much
anyhow; so Jeff stands a good chance to get along. I'm
sorry for one thing; the Fusticks are put out with him.
He's got a way of blurtin' out, you know, a good deal like
his father; he don't mean nothin' by it, but he made the
Fusticks mad. I hope he'll do his best to mend the matter
when he comes back, for I can't bear that anybody
should feel hard towards my son: I'd rather they'd be mad
at me. 'Twas a little time before Ann Eliza was married&mdash;the
last time Jeff was home.</p>

<p>What! didn't you know Ann Eliza'd popped off?
Well, she has; she's married a missionary, and gone away
off to convart the heathen in the island of Muffletegawny.
I don't know as that's exactly the name, but it's as nigh as
I can come to it, anyhow. Ain't it sing'lar that such a
highty-fighty, flirtin' thing should ketch a missionary?
She ain't much like Mr. Parson's wife; she 'twas Urainy
Slammerkin, old Slammerkin's daughter. I know'd her;
she was raised in Wiggletown, where I was brought up.

<!-- page 347 -->

She was quite a religious, sober-minded young woman.
Married Reuben Parsons, from Tuckertown, a good sort
of a critter, but ruther softy. They went on a mission to
the&mdash;the what-do-ye-eall-'ems. I never can remember
names. Their letters used to be published in the <i>Gospel
Trumpet</i>. 'Twas an awful hot country where they went,
and the people was dreadful savages&mdash;didn't wear no
clothin'. Some of 'em went to Mr. Parson's meetins,
though they couldn't understand a word he said.</p>

<p>Well, the Wiggletown and Tuckertown ladies read the
accounts in the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i>, and they was wonderfully
scandalized to think the poor critters hadn't nothin' to
wear to meetin'; so they clubbed together, and made up a
great box of clothin', and sent over to 'em all sorts of
things, ever so many frocks, and petticoats, and hoods,
and pantaloons, and so forth. The Parsonses distributed
'em, and made the savages understand they was to wear
'em to meetin'. So the next time Mr. Parsons preached,
in come the barbarians risked out in high snuff. The men
was swelterin' under the hoods, with the sweat all streamin'
down their faces, and the wimmin had the pantaloons round
their necks, as if they'd been long shawls. The frocks and
petticoats they fetcht along, and spread 'em out to sit on.</p>

<p>After the Parsonses had been there about ten years, I
saw a notice in the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i>&mdash;I'd left Wiggletown
then&mdash;sayin' that "the Reverend Reuben Parsons and his
wife, our devoted missionaries to the&mdash;the thingumbobs,
(I wish I could ever remember names) had left their
field of labor, and returned to this country, for the purpose
of bringin' over their <i>eight</i> children, to leave 'em here. It
was their intention to dispose of the children here and
there, and then return to their interestin' portion of the

<!-- page 348 -->

Lord's vineyard." I thought there must be some mistake
about it. "It can't be possible," says I, "that any
mother would be willin' to give up her children in that
way. I'd as soon tear out my eyes as do it." Well, I
happened to meet Mr. Parsons and his wife when they
was in this country. I was over to Wiggletown a visitin',
and they came there to see their friends and bring a couple
of their daughters to give away. Miss Major Coon took
one&mdash;she hadn't no children&mdash;and Parson Potter's wife
took t'other; she had nine of her own already. I says to
Miss Parsons, "Urainy," says I, " 'taint true, is it, that
you're a gwine to leave your children scattered 'round, and
go back to heathen lands?"</p>

<p>"Certingly," says she.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll give it up, now," says I; "I thought it
must be a mistake. Why, what's your object in leavin'
your children, if you must go back yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh," says she, "I want to devote the hull of my
time and energies to the heathen."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I should think if you did your duty
by them eight children, you couldn't 'a had much time to
attend to the savages. See! you've ben there ten years;
you must 'a got 'em to a pretty high state of civilization by
this time, for I remember hearin', when you'd ben there
only six months, that the wimmin had larnt what their
'rights' was, and put on the pantaloons."</p>

<p>Miss Parsons looked at me with the greatest astonishment,
and says she, "You don't seem to understand the
subject, Miss Magwire."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't," says I, "for I confess it's an onaccountable
mystery to me how you can be willin' to give up
your own children so."</p>

<!-- page 349 -->

<p>"I never regarded 'em as my own," says she; "I look
upon 'em as only lent to me by the Lord."</p>

<p>"So much the worse, then," says I. "If they belong
to the Lord, and He's only lent 'em to you, of course
you'd ought to be all the more careful of 'em, so's to be
able to give a good account of your stewardship."</p>

<p>"But you know," says she, "Scripter commands us to
leave all and foller the Lord."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I never s'posed that meant we was
to give away our children and go off to heathen lands,
though I don't pretend to be much of a hand at interpretin'
Scripter."</p>

<p>"But you know," says she, "the great work of convertin'
a world lyin' in wickedness has got to be done.
The Apostles was commanded to go preach the gospel to
every cretur."</p>

<p>"I know it," says I, "but the wimmin wa'n't commanded
to go. We don't read that the Apostles took
wives along. And them seventy that was sent out&mdash;s'posen
they'd all had wives with 'em, how much good do
you think they'd 'a done? And after a few years what if
they'd 'a sent home eight times seventy children&mdash;granting
they'd each had your number&mdash;for the church to take
care of? I guess they'd 'a had to found an orphan asylum
to put 'em in."</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "I can truly say that I'm perfectly
willin' and resigned to part with every one of my children,
trustin' that the Lord will take care of 'em."</p>

<p>"It's time enough to exercise resignation when the
Lord calls for 'em," says I; "but as long as He spares
'em to you, it seems to me you'd ought to consider it your

<!-- page 350 -->

greatest duty and privilege to stay with 'em, and do for
'em as nobody but a mother can."</p>

<p>"I see," said she, "you don't understand the subject at
all, Miss Magwire."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't," says I.</p>

<p>Whether Miss Parsons was mistaken or not, I know she
meant to do right, for she was a good woman, a good,
pious woman, enough better than I be, though I wouldn't
'a done as she did for all the world.</p>

<p>But I was gwine to tell about Deacon Fustick's daughter
gittin' married. I was surprised, and, I must say,
amused, at the performances. Her mother's a dreadful
manuverin' woman, you know, always figurin' round to
get beaux for her daughters, in an awful hurry to get 'em
married off. Sing'lar, ain't it, that any mother can feel
so? Why, when Nancy was married and left me, it eny
most broke my heart, though she was only an adopted
child. I didn't want to oppose it, you know, for she got
a very likely young man. But Miss Fustick don't seem
to care much who nor what her girls get, if she can only
marry 'em off. Amanda wa'n't but sixteen when she was
married; her mother made the match entirely, and the
man's a miserable stick. There's no tellin' the trials poor
Amanda's underwent since she took him. But it didn't
seem to be no warnin' to Miss Fustick at all. She went on
manuverin' and flourishin' round, pokin' her girls forrard
into the face and eyes of all the young men, till she succeeded
in gettin' rid of 'em all but Ann Eliza, and she
done her best for her too; but somehow she didn't seem to
take. She's ruther a pretty-lookin' girl, but she was so
lazy, and so fond of dress, and so etarnally in the streets,
laughin', and hollerin', and bawlin' at everybody she met,

<!-- page 351 -->

and doin' everything she could to attract attention, that she
overshot the mark. Nobody didn't seem to take a fancy
to her; the young men seemed willin' enough to beau her
round, but they didn't want her for a wife. At length,
her mother begun to get discouraged about her; so last
fall she packed her off to spend the winter in Gambletown,
where they've got some rich elbow cousins. The theological
siminary's located there, you know, and I s'pose she
thought 'twould be a good place to try her luck.</p>

<p>She called to our house one day in the winter, and told
me she'd had such a gratifyin' letter from Ann Eliza, she
wished she'd a thought to fetch it along with her and read
it to me. Ann Eliza had become so very much interested
in the cause of foreign missions, and felt to regret that she
hadn't hitherto entered more fully into her ma's views and
feelin's on that subject. "You know," says Miss Fustick,
"that's a cause that lies very near my heart."</p>

<p>I was surprised enough to hear it of Ann Eliza; but I
knowd there was something behind the curt'in, and waited
patiently to see what 'twas. The next time I saw Miss
Fustick she told me that Ann Eliza had got so exercised
in view of the dreadful condition of the heathen, especially
the Muffletegawnys, that she'd made up her mind to go
on a mission to 'em if pa and ma was willin'. "Of
course we esteem it a privilege to have her go," says Miss
Fustick. Well, I was surprisder than ever, and couldn't
help tellin' her so; but she didn't seem to consider it anythin'
strange at all. And it never once entered her head
to think but what Ann Eliza was a very suitable person
for such an undertakin.</p>

<p>"Law me!" says I, "if she's in such distress to go on
a mission, send her up here to Puddenbag Lane; 'taint

<!-- page 352 -->

far off, and she couldn't desire to see a more heathenish set
than the folks that live there; 'twould be a first-rate field
of labor." Miss Fustick gin me one of her looks, and
walked off without sayin' another word.</p>

<p>A few weeks after that, Ann Eliza got home, and then
the mystery was all explained. She'd got a beau! a Mr.
Simpson, a missionary to the Muffletegawnys (I guess
that's the name). He'd lost his wife about six months
before, and come back to get another, and fetch his six
children over to make this country a present of 'em. He
was edicated at the Gambletown Siminary. So he
went there to look round, got acquainted with Ann Eliza.
She was wonderfully interested in his accounts of Muffletegawny,
and he was wonderfully interested in her. In
short, they got engaged about a week after they first saw
each other. He was to sail in a few weeks, and Ann
Eliza came home to make preparations for leavin'.</p>

<p>I declare I couldn't help laughin' to see how hard she
tried to look dignified and solemn. I called to see her a
few days after she got home. Jeff went with me; he and
she was old cronies; they'd had many a frolic together.
She was wonderful stately to us, had her face drawd down
about half a yard long.</p>

<p>"So, Ann Eliza," says Jeff, "it seems you're O P H
for Muffletegawny!"</p>

<p>"Yes," says she, with a doleful kind of a look, "I'm
about to enlist in the cause of missions. Oh, Jefferson!
how rejoiced I should be if you'd become a missionary!"</p>

<p>"Should!" says Jeff, says he, "do you think I could
cut out Mr. Simpson?"</p>

<p>Ann Eliza skrewed the corners of her mouth and tried
to look dignifider than ever, but she had hard work to
make it out.</p>

<!-- page 353 -->

<p>"I've a notion to try," says Jeff, cockin' up his eye.
"You hold on a spell and give me a chance."</p>

<p>Ann Eliza snickered out, and says she, "Git along,
Jeff Magwire! you make me laugh in spite of myself."</p>

<p>The next day Deacon Peabody's wife come to our house
and told me that the congregation was gwin to make up a
box of clothin' for Ann Eliza, and said she s'posed I'd
esteem it a privilege to contribbit my share towards it.
Well, I didn't view it as any great privilege to be sure,
but I thought I'd ought to give somethin', so I said I'd
send a piece of bleached muslin. Miss Peabody said that
Ann Eliza had received a good many presents, articles for
housekeepin' and so forth, from her friends in Gambletown,
and she hoped there'd be enough contribbited in
Scrabble Hill to make up her outfit. She said that the
ladies that wished to avail themselves of the privilege of
assistin' in this great object would meet at Deacon Fustick's
the next Friday afternoon and sew for Ann Eliza;
of course I wouldn't miss of comin', and I might fetch
my contribution along. I told her I'd come if I could.
And she went home.</p>

<p>I'd gin up attendin' the sewin' society since Parson
Tuttle was sent off, for I'd made up my mind there was
more hurt than good come of 'em. I held a meetin' at
home, alone by myself, went into a committee of the hull,
and past a unanimous resolution of disgust at sewin' societies
in gineral, and the Scrabble Hill sewin' society in
partic'lar, and detarmined never to attend it agin.</p>

<p>But after Miss Peabody went away I thought it over,
and concluded to go, for 'twan't a reg'lar meetin' of the
society, and, to tell the truth, I had some curiosity to see
what would be done. So when Friday came, I takes my

<!-- page 354 -->

piece of muslin and starts off for Deacon Fustick's. I
told Mr. Magwire to come after me in the evenin', but he
said he'd be hanged if he would; so Jeff asked if he
mightn't come. "You may if you'll promise to behave,"
says I. "Of course I'll do that," says he.</p>

<p>When I got there, I found quite a number of ladies
collected, old and young. The old ones were knittin'
stockin's for Mr. Simpson, and the young ones was makin'
all sorts of things for Ann Eliza&mdash;capes, collars, cuffs,
and what not. The Skinners was workin' a pair of foot-stools
with woosted. Liddy Ann Buill was makin' a
fancy head-dress. Polly Mariar Stillman was embrawderin'
a mornin' cap. Jo Gipson's wife and Miss Brewster
was sewin' lace on to a number of pocket-han'kerchers.
Ann Mariar Lippincott was workin' a pair of slippers for
Mr. Simpson. Gloriann Billins was makin' him a green
velvet smokin'-cap, figurin' it all over with gilt cord.
And Ann Eliza herself was workin' him a pair of fancy
suspenders. The Peabody girls was makin' a blue muslin
sack. Miss Samson Savage was there, too, pickin' her
teeth, and exercisin' a gineral supervision over the rest,
orderin' this one and commandin' that; as for sewin', she
said they needn't expect her to do any, for she'd eat such
a hearty dinner she couldn't. Miss Fustick and Miss
Peabody had gone over to Harristown to buy Ann
Eliza's carpets, and engage a dressmaker to come over
and make her new dresses. She's got three very nice silk
ones, and a number more, and there want no dressmaker
in Scrabble Hill that was fashionable enough to rig out a
missionary's lady.</p>

<p>For a spell after I got there, I sot and looked with all
the eyes I had. I didn't know what to make on't. Thinks

<!-- page 355 -->

me this ain't much such an outfit as Miss Parsons had.
How the times is altered! I guess they mean to astonish
the natives. After a spell, Miss Samson Savage spoke
up and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Magwire, do you want some work, or do
you calculate to set and hold your hands all the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No," says I, "I want to help if there's anything I
can do, but I aint no hand at fancy work. I fetcht along
some muslin I thought would do for shirts and such;
if there was some things cut out of that, I could sew
on 'em."</p>

<p>So I went into the hall and brought it in. Ann Eliza
got up and examined it, and said 'twas altogether too
coarse for such purposes, but she guessed 'twould do for
very common kitchen-chamber sheets. If I was a mind
to, I might tear off some and make 'em. I was kind
of hurt, for I'd took pains to pick out what I thought was
a nice fine piece. But I didn't say nothing. I tore off
the sheets and went to work at 'em; Margaret Pettibone
took hold and helped me. She kept a-tradin' on my toe
all the afternoon. Mag's pretty keen; there's a good deal
of the "white horse" in her; she's a good hearted-girl,
too.</p>

<p>Bymeby Miss Fustick and Miss Peabody got back.
They was in high spirits, for they'd made some first-rate
bargains in carpets and hearth-rugs. The marchant had
throw'd off considerable when they told him the things
was to go on a mission. "I says to him," says Miss
Fustick, "that no doubt, under the circumstances, he'd
esteem it a privilege to let us have 'em as low as possible.
He said, 'Certingly,' and I think we got 'em very reasonable
indeed,"</p>

<!-- page 356 -->

<p>In the evenin' there was several young men come in.
And the new minister, Parson Pulsifer, he was there too.
He's a single man; ben here since about the middle of
winter. Cappen Smalley, and a few more of the richest
men in the congregation, after they'd got rid of Parson
Tuttle, detarmined they'd have a single man; they come
cheaper than married ones, you know. Of course all the
wimmin that had daughters to peddle off, and all others
that was willin' to dispose of themselves, fell in with the
plan, and so they gin Mr. Pulsifer a call. He was
preachin' in Punkin Hook on trial at the time, and accepted
the call. He's wonderful popilar with 'em all, more so
than any minister they've had before. He's quite a young
man, and very good lookin'. He was brought up a few
miles out of Boston, I forget the name of the place. They
think he's terrible eloquent here, especially the young
folks. But, for my part, I don't consider him nigh so
deep a man as Parson Scrantum was; and in p'int of
plain, practical sarmonizin' he doesn't come up to Parson
Tuttle by a good deal. I try to make the best of him
though.</p>

<p>I always try to like my minister, for I do hate to hear
folks, especially wimmin, forever findin' fault with their
minister, complainin' about his style and manner, or his
want of this, and too much of that, saying they aint edified,
and all that sort of stuff. I don't often see a minister
that I can't larn something from, if I'm a mind to be teachable
and take home to myself what they say. But, somehow,
Mr. Pulsifer puzzles me. I listen just as close as
ever I can; I give my hull attention to him when he's
preachin', but I can't make head nor tail on't. His language
is so kind of double-and-twisted, that I can't for the

<!-- page 357 -->

life of me make out what he's drivin' at. He might as
well preach in Dutch, for all the good it does me.</p>

<p>Once in a while he has a sentence that sounds some like
other folks, and I begin to feel encouraged, and hope he's
a comin' down to the level of my comprehension. But
the next minute he's away in the hyasticks ag'in, stringin
it off about the "great All-soul of creation," and so on,
and I give it up in despair. But I never say nothing about
it, for I won't talk about my minister, nor discuss his qualities
with nobody; 'taint right.</p>

<p>It's amusin' to hear the remarks made about him by the
young folks, especially the girls. "What a delightful
preacher!" says one. "Did you ever hear such a sermon?"
says another. "How animated!" says another.
"I never could go to sleep under <i>his</i> preachin'." The
Skinners come up aside of Jeff and me one Sunday as we
was gwine home from meetin'. "Don't you think Mr.
Pulsifer treated the subject in a very original manner?"
says Almira.</p>

<p>"Very!" says Jeff, "entirely original"&mdash;</p>

<p>I hunched him, for I saw he was gwine to say somethin'
he hadn't ought to.</p>

<p>"Don't you think him very sublime?" says Sophrony.</p>

<p>"Well," says Jeff, "it's a great deal to call a man
sublime, but I think we may safely say our minister ain't
but a <i>step</i> from it; for you know Burke says"&mdash;</p>

<!-- I assume this quote was meant:
"It is thus with the vulgar, and all men are as the vulgar
in what they do not understand" -->

<p>I gin him another hunch, and so he stopt short; for I'd
heard him quote that remark before. Jeff's quite inclined
to make fun of Parson Pulsifer, but I never encourage him.
When we got home, I told him never to say nothin' disparagin'
of his minister, and he promised he wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulsifer writes poetry, too, and the girls go into

<!-- page 358 -->


fits over it. To my mind, it's dreadful singular poetry. I
never saw nothin' to beat it. Full of wrong-end-foremost
words, and goes hitchity-hitch along. Sounds to me like
sawin' through a board full of rusty nails. Jeff says the
minister's got a high-dutch muse, but I tell him to hold his
tongue. You'd laugh, though, to see what a time there is
a-settin' caps at him. The young girls have all got to be
wonderful stiddy, go-to-meetin' characters since he came.
They wouldn't miss the Wensday evenin' lecter for nothin'.
The Skinners think Polly Maria Stillman acts like a fool
over Mr. Pulsifer; and Polly Mariar thinks the Skinners
are desperit pious all of a sudden. Charity Grimes thinks
Liddy Ann Buill's conduct is ridicilous for a person of <i>her
age;</i> and Liddy Ann thinks Charity Grimes had better
get a <i>wig</i>, if she wants to ketch Mr. Pulsifer. And so
they have it, back and forth, all over town. I can't help
bein' amused, and Jeff has lots of fun out on't.</p>

<p>But I was tellin' about the meetin' at Deacon Fustick's.
Well, in the evenin' Miss Samson Savage said she wanted
to see the rest of the presents that Ann Eliza'd received;
so Miss Fustick brought 'em out, and spread 'em on the
table. Grammany! it a'most dazzled my eyes to look
at 'em. There was a dozen silver forks, presented by a
rich lady in Gambletown; a splendid tea-pot from another;
a lot of napkin-rings from some young ladies in that village&mdash;Miss
Fustick said that the Gambletown folks was deeply
interested in the cause of missions; then there was a couple
of elegant butter-knives from Miss Samson Savage&mdash;she
launches out once in a while, and does somethin' grand&mdash;and
quite a number of articles for the table that I don't
know the names nor the use of; and there was no end to
the capes, and collars, and neck-ribbons, and flummydiddles
of all sorts that had been gin to her.</p>

<!-- page 359 -->

<p>While we was a-lookin' at the things, Jeff came in. He
jest glanced at 'em, and then sot down by the stove and
went to talkin' with Deacon Fustick. I felt relieved, for I
was afraid he'd be makin' some of his speeches. There
was a number more young men come in, and after a spell
Mr. Pulsifer arriv. When he made his appearance, we
all sot down, and there was a gineral time of puckerin'
and primmin' among the girls. Almira Skinner draw'd
her chair up to the table, and went to readin' in a Bible
that laid there, as if there wan't nobody in the room but
herself. The conversation turned on to the subject of
missions before long, and Miss Fustick said she hoped
Ann Eliza'd have grace to sustain her in her great undertakin'."</p>

<p>"I hope so too, ma," says Ann Eliza. She sot twirlin'
a napkin-ring on her fingers.</p>

<p>The deacon remarked that " 'twas a great thing to give
up all for the sake of carryin' the Gospel to heathen lands&mdash;a
very great thing."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," says Ann Eliza, glancin' at the butter-knives.</p>

<p>Parson Pulsifer said something about "heart devotion
and world-wide influence," and then Charity Grimes begun
to talk away about the duties and responsibilities of a minister's
wife, both at home and in foreign lands; she's got
a long tongue. Miss Samson Savage winked at the Stillmans,
and the Stillmans winked back agin. Liddy Ann
Buill was settin' beside me, and says she, "Did you ever!
that's to let Mr. Pulsifer know how well <i>she</i> understands a
minister's wife's duty."</p>

<p>Polly Mariar Stillman said she intended to propose to
the ladies, at the next meetin' of the sewin' society, to pay

<!-- page 360 -->

for the eddication of one of the Muffletegawny boys, to be
named "Jeremiah Pulsifer." Mr. Pulsifer bowed, and
thanked her for the compliment. I couldn't help pityin'
the poor little savage, whoever he might be, that had got
to have such a name.</p>

<p>Jeff spoke up, and says he, "I don't know much about
these Muffletegawnys; desperate heathen, I s'pose, though,
ain't they, Ann Eliza?"</p>

<p>"O yes," says she, "they're victims of idolatry."</p>

<p>"Poor benighted barbarians!" says Jeff, with a groan,
"how I pity 'em!"</p>

<p>Miss Fustick was sittin' t'other side of Liddy Ann Buill,
and she reached acrost, and hunched me, and says she,
"Has Jefferson experienced religion?"</p>

<p>"Not in particular," says I.</p>

<p>"I didn't know but he had, from the way he spoke,"
says she. "Thought perhaps they'd had a special effort in
Coonville, and he'd ben brought in."</p>

<p>"Hereafter," says Jeff, very solemnly, "I shall take a
great interest in the Muffletegawnys."</p>

<p>Miss Fustick reached acrost agin, and says she, "Depend
on't, Miss Magwire, he's exercised in his mind, anyhow.
I shouldn't wonder if Ann Eliza's mission had set
him a-thinkin'."</p>

<p>Jeff groaned agin. "Poor critters!" says he; and he
lookt at the wall and shook his head. You'd 'a thought
his hull soul was wrapt up in the heathen. The young
men stared and didn't say nothin'; Parson Pulsifer lookt
surprised, and I confess I wondered myself what Jeff was
up to.</p>

<p>"It's a great work, Brother Pulsifer," says Deacon
Fustick, "a great and glorious work, this mission to

<!-- page 361 -->

Muffletegawny, and I feel to rejoice that a daughter of
mine is about to take her life in her hand and go forth to
engage in it."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" says I, "I don't see how you can bear
the idea of partin' with her to go so far off; like enough
you never'll see her agin."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Magwire," says Deacon Fustick, "you
hain't got the right kind of feelin' about it; we'd ought to
rejoice"&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Fustick interrupted him, and says she: "For my
part, if I had half a dozen daughters left, I should esteem
it a privilege to have 'em all devoted to such a work."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I can't feel so, nor I can't see how
anybody can."</p>

<p>"Mother," says Jeff, very seriously, "you don't understand
it all; you don't view it in the right light."</p>

<p>"You're right, Jefferson," says Ann Eliza; "your
ma's views are peculiar; I hope you'll convince her of her
error."</p>

<p>"I shall try," said Jeff, and he gin another dreadful
groan.</p>

<p>Miss Fustick poked over to me agin, and says she,
"Take my word for't, Jeff's under consairn, and he'll
come out before long."</p>

<p>"Mother," says he, "jest consider the condition of the
Muffletegawnys; think how deplorably ignorant they are.
Why, they never saw nor heard of <i>napkin-rings, butter-knives,
silver forks, and so forth!</i> and I don't s'pose they
know a smokin'-cap from a stage-driver's jockey! Now,
ain't it important that they should be taught the use of
such articles as soon as possible, and learn how Christians
live? It's a great work, mother, a very great work,"

<!-- page 362 -->

<p>For a spell after Jeff had freed his mind, there wa'n't a
word said by nobody. Deacon Fustick ham'd and haw'd,
Miss Fustick lookt perfectly stumpt, and Ann Eliza didn't
seem to know what to make on't. Bymeby, Margaret
Pettibone whispered to me, and says she, "I guess Jeff's
come out ruther sooner than Miss Fustick expected."</p>

<p>After a spell, Deacon Fustick requested Mr. Pulsifer to
"address the throne of grace." Somehow I don't like to
hear that; it sounds too much like sayin' "make an oration
to the Lord!" When the prayer was ended, we all
went home.</p>

<p>After Jeff and I got out of hearin', I scolded him
soundly. "Jeff," said I, "I'm ashamed of you. How
could you sarve me such a trick, after promisin' not to cut
up?"</p>

<p>"O, no, mother dear," says he, "you're mistaken; I
didn't promise so. I said I'd <i>behave</i>, and didn't I?"</p>

<p>Ann Eliza was married a few weeks after. They had
quite a weddin'. Husband and I was invited, <i>but Jeff
wasn't</i>; and, on the hull, I was glad on't, for if he'd 'a
ben there, like~enough he'd 'a let out another link. Husband
went with me; he was cur'us to see Mr. Simpson,
and so was I. He was quite a spruce, good-lookin',
youngerly man, with big whiskers and gold spectacles.
His ringin' throughout was all in the latest fashion. The
girls all thought his manners was very polished, but there
was ruther more bow and scrape about him than I like;
I'm old-fashioned, though.</p>

<p>Parson Pulsifer married 'em, and I tell you he did it
high snuff. After the cake was past round there was a
great time about a ring that they pretended was in it, and
the one that got it would be married next. Of course

<!-- page 363 -->

'twas all hurraw boys, and giggle and titter for the rest of
the evenin'. But Ann Eliza sot still on the sofy, and
lookt as interesting as she could. I didn't see her stir all
the evenin'. A short time before we broke up, Miss Fustick
went round and brought 'em to order, and we had
several "addresses to the throne of grace." Deacon Fustick
led, Deacon Parker and Deacon Peabody follered,
and Mr. Pulsifer closed. After that they sung "From
Greenland's icy mountains," for a windin' up. Then we
bid Ann Eliza good-by, and went home.</p>

<p>They left the next day. There was quite a number of
waggin loads of young folks went over to Harristown with
'em to see 'em take the cars. Jeff went too; he didn't
lay it up not being invited to the weddin'. Margaret Pettibone
said that when Jeff went up to bid Ann Eliza good-by,
he gin her a good smack, and says he, "Now, Ann
Eliza, if Mr. Simpson don't use you well, let me know,
and I'll come over." Mr. Simpson didn't know who Jeff
was, and he stared over his gold specs in perfect astonishment.</p>

<p>Parson Pulsifer writ a piece of poetry on the occasion,
'Twas printed in the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> and copied into the
<i>Scrabble Hill Luminary</i>. I saved the paper that had it in.
I'll get it, and you may read it; read it out loud, and see
if it doesn't kind of make yer jaws ache.</p>

<p>T'OTHER evenin' the Deacon and I was a settin' by
the stove ('twas ruther a chilly evenin'), I a nittin'
and he a readin' the Paris Hill Dimocrat (my
husband's a terrible dimocrat, it's all there is agin
him), when lo and behold, our Zebidee cum in (he's the
deacon's son, my step son) a clappin' his hands, and kickin'
up like all possest.</p>

<p>"What's to pay now?" interrigoried I.</p>

<p>"Hooraw," says he; "I've ben warned."</p>

<p>"The dragon," says I, "who's had the audackity to
warn you agin sin and temptation, when yer father's ben
deacon risin' twenty year?"</p>

<p>"Don't ye know nothin'," says he, "I've ben warned
to train, and I've got to go down to Skeeterburrer next
Monday to muster."</p>

<p>"O, grandfer gracious," says I, "I dident make no
fuss when Jabez had to train, 'cause there warn't no signs
o' war then; but seems to me in these ere days it's awful
dangerous to be a trainer."</p>

<p>"What for," says the Deacon, says he.</p>

<p>"Why," says I, "my fust husband use to say how't if
Van Buren ever got to be President, ther'd certing be war.
So now he's appinted, I suspect ev'ry day when the storm

<!-- page 368 -->

o' war'll bust over our heads; and O, dear suz it's awful,
to think of Jabez and Zebidee a fightin' in the midst of
combatlin' hosts."</p>

<p>"O, 'shaw," says Zeb, "what do you know about
war?"</p>

<p>"Or pollyticks, eyether," says the Deacon.</p>

<p>"About war, you sarsebox!" says I to Zebidee. "I
ruther gess I know as much about it as you do, for my
grandfer fit in the revolutionery tussle, and I've heern him
discribe it time and agin. As to pollyticks," continyd I,
glancin' at the deacon; "I know as much about 'em as I
want tew; my fust husband was quite a pollyticker, and
what's more, he was on the right side. He hated old
Jackson, and all the dimocrats, like pison, and I gess if
he'd a lived a spell longer, Van Buren never'd a ben president,
for he wouldent a voted for him, even if he'd a ben
sure o' bein' made supervisor for't."</p>

<p>"Missis Gorum," says the Deacon, says he, "I hope
you don't mean to cast no reflexions."</p>

<p>"O, dear," says I, "do you s'pose you'd a ben made
supervisor if you hadent a quit the whigs, and jined the
dimocrats?"</p>

<p>"Permilly," says the deacon, says he, edgin' his cheer
up to me, and tappin' of me under the chin. "Permilly,"
says he, "don't never say no more about that are,
that's a purty creetur."</p>

<p>"Lemme alone," says I, shovin' off. "What do I
know about pollyticks?"</p>

<p>The deacon he lookt kinder grieved, and took up his
paper and went to readin' agin. Zebidee he cleared out,
and we tew was left alone by ourselves. Arter a spell, I
begun to feel ruther unpleasant, and thinks me, I show'd

<!-- page 369 -->

ruther tew much spunk about that are speech o' the Deacon's
seein' it's the fust dizagreeable thing he ever said to
me. Well, we sot so much as an hour, and feeling myself
intirely onable to indure the hidins of the Deacon's
countenance any longer, I jumped up all of a sudding,
run up to him, huv my arms round his neck, and bust into
a terrible flood o' tears. The Deacon was dretfully affected;
he imbraced me tenderly, exclamagatin,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Milly, darlin', you do know suthin' about pollyticks;
certingly ye know enough to cum over onto the right side,
when you've ben on the wrong. Don't ye, blessin'?"</p>

<p>"O, Deacon dear," says I, "don't never illude to the
dizagreeable subjick of pollyticks in my presence agin."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't," says he.</p>

<p>Jest that minnit sumbody knockt to the door, and says
I, "Walk in," and in cum Squire Jones.</p>

<p>"Hooraw! hooraw!" says he, and then he up and
danced a jig in the middle o' the floor.</p>

<p>"What in natur's to pay," says the Deacon and me,
says we.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "the President's a guayne to be to
Utica day arter to-morrer."</p>

<p>"You don't," says the Deacon, says he.</p>

<p>"Jest so," says the Squire; "and we're all a guayne
down to meet him; all the dimocrats of this ere stiff dimocratic
town; and you must go 'long, you know the
papers tells about the staunch yomandery of the kentry;
the back-bone o' the nation turnin' out to meet the president
in their lumber waggins, in rael republican stile.
Well, that's jest the way we're a guayne. He's suspected
to Whitestown about ten o'clock, and there he's a guayne
to got off the cars, and the hull town of Utica's a cummin'
up to carry him down to their place."</p>

<!-- page 370 -->

<p>"On a rail?" says I.</p>

<p>"No, by jolly," says the Squire. "On a fust rate
hoss."</p>

<p>"Massy sakes," says I, "if they don't have a rail,
seems to me they'd or'to have a jackass, or sum sich creetur
for him, so's to look republican, and corrispond with
the flambergasted waggins that's a cummin' to meet him
from all directions."</p>

<p>"Oh, shaw!" says the Squire, "what do you know
about"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop, Squire," says the Deacon. "Don't talk up to
my wife that way."</p>

<p>So the Squire dident eend what he begun to say, but
says he: "My wife's beset to go long, and I tell'd her
how't if your wife would go, she mut go tew, so what do
ye say to't?"</p>

<p>"Why, it depends on circumstences," says I. "Sha'nt
I have to hooraw nor nothin'? 'cause 'twould go awfully
agin my conshence to hooraw for Van Buren."</p>

<p>"The old boy!" says the Squire, "who ever heerd of
the wiminin's hoorawin' on sich a 'casion?"</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I dident know but what they did,
'cause I never went to no sich doin's. Well, Ile accompanate
ye."</p>

<p>"That's you," says the Squire, and then he went hum,
and jest then Zebidee cum hum, and right arterwards my
Amandy. Malviny returned from singin'-school, and Kier
Simpson with her. (Kier's ben takin' arter her risin' tew
year.) Well, Amandy and Zebidee was beset to go, so
we concludid to let 'em. And Kier said he'd take Amandy
in his surveyance. Well, the Deacon, and me and Zebidee,
we went into the kitching and left Kier and Amandy alone,

<!-- page 371 -->

(weve ben in hopes he'd cum to the pint and ax her to have
him, for sum time; and it's high time he did for he's went
hum with her from singin'-school and conf'rence meetin'
visin' tew year, and I'm sure I don't know what the creetur
means by puttin' off so, for he's ividently very much besmitten
with her, and no wonder, for she's an oncommon
interestin' young woman, looks very much as I did when I
was a gearl; there ain't a feller in our place but what
would be glad to git her. But she's ividently more pleased
with Kier, than with ary other feller, and I wish to
gracious he'd suppose himself to her.) Well, the next day,
we was all day a gittin' in a state of reddyation, and the
Deacon he tell'd me to dew up his ruffled shirt, for he said,
"seein' he was a guayne to eat dinner with the President,
'twas recumbent upon him to look as slick as possible."</p>

<p>"So," says I, "yer a guayne to eat dinner with him, hay?"</p>

<p>"Certingly," says he, "what else should I go to Utica
for."</p>

<p>Well, thinks me, if the Deacon wants to eat dinner with
the creetur, he may, and I won't say nothin' agin it, tho' I
druther be hanged than to go long with him, but I will
neverstandin'.</p>

<p>Well, the next mornin' we all got reddy very airly.
Zebidee he harnessed the hosses, and Amandy and me we
habiliated ourselves as follers. She put on that are yaller
figgerd silk gownd o'hern, and her black silk mankiller
with white fringe round it, and her pink slurred bunnit
with a master sight of artifishel roses and chany asters on't,
and if she dident look purty it's no matter. I put on my
cinnamon colored canton crape, 'cause I reckon it's more
becomin' to my figger than ary gownd I've got. Then I
wore my red meryno shawl, and my green silk bunnit surmounted

<!-- page 372 -->

by one long black ostridge fether; and I must
say I lookt uncommon well. But goody grievous! how
Missis Squire Jones <i>did</i> look! Missis Jones is a master
nice woman and persessed of considerble intellectitude, but
she haint no more taste in the arrangement of her attire
than an old cow. But I can't spend time to discribe her
twilight.</p>

<p>Well, Kier he cum in his one horse waggin, and
Amandy got in with him, and the Deacon and me, and
Zebidee, we got into our surveyance and purty soon all the
rest of the folks cum along, and by seven o'clock the hull
sivilcade sot out. Well, by ten o'clock we arrove to
Whitestown and druv up to Capting Clapp's Hotell, and
arter takin' sum pie and cheeze we sot out to go to the railroad,
the Deacon and me and Zebidee fust, Squire Jones
and lady next, Kier Simpson and Amandy next, and arter
them the rest of the remainder of our townsfolks; and in
that monner we plummenaded down to the railroad, and I
swonny, I b'l'eve we extracted as much attention as the
president himself. There was thousands and millions o'
folks in the streets and they did stare at us consairnedly, at
me pertickilerly, for I must say I was the most extinguished
individyal in our party in pint o' looks. I never was in sich
a crowd in my born days.</p>

<p>Me and Amandy and the Squire's wife, was the ony shemales
to be seen. And arter a standin' there as much as an
hour, and the President dident come, I says to the Deacon
says I, "Deacon, dear, I feel kind o' timersome about
standin' here among sich a mess o' men folks."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," says Missis Jones, "I ain't afeard of
their bitin' of me." (Missis Jones is awful bold.)</p>

<p>"O Kier," says Amandy, "I wish Ide a wore my vail,
the men folks stare so."

<!-- page 373 -->

<p>"O," says Kier, "that's 'cause they ain't use to seein'
sich honsome faces." "O lawful suz!" says Amandy says
she, "yer a blaggardin' of me." Jest then the folks hollerd
out "the cars is cummin'," and sure enough purty
soon the injine cum a smokin' and buzzin' and clatterin'
along, and the Deacon and Zebidee they hysted me onto
the fence so I could see over the folks.</p>

<p>"Do ye see him?" says the Deacon.</p>

<p>"No," says I.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "that are gentleman with gray briches
on that they're jest a hystin' out's him."</p>

<p>"O," says I, "do ye mean that are short old feller,
ruther corputent, with gray and yaller hair a stickin' out
so consairnedly."</p>

<p>"That's him," says he.</p>

<p>"O lawful sakes," says I, "we might a seen enough
better lookin' men without cummin' so fur."</p>

<p>"True," says the Deacon, says he, "but they wouldent
a ben all presidents."</p>

<p>Jest that minnit there was a pussy man cum puffin' and
blowin', through the crowd, leadin' a very 'rantic hoss, for
the President to ride on; and a number o' men took hold
and boosted Marting up. As soon as he was fairly surmounted,
he spied me, and he took of his hat and begun a
bowin' to me at an all killin' rate. I no doubt he was very
much struck with my appearance, for it did seem as if he'd
stare me thro'. Well, he kept a bowin' and I kept a curchyin'
on the fence, till I begun to feel ruther flustrated.</p>

<p>"O dear," says I, "I feel tumble dashed to be stared
at and bowed at so, line a blushin' like all natur. Deacon
dear, do take me off this ere pre-eminence."</p>

<p>"O lawful suz," says Missis Jones, "I wouldent be
afeard o' the face o' Clay."</p>

<!-- page 374 -->

"Nor me nyther," says I, "for I don't bleve Clay's
got sich plagy sharp eyes as Van Buren has."</p>

<p>Well we went back to the tarvern to reassume our
waggins and perceed to Utica. It had bid fair to be rainy
all day and jest as we got to the capting's, it clouded up
wuss than ever, and lookt as if 'twould pour every minnit,
and Missis Jones said for her part she want a guayne a
step furder, she'd no notion o' gittin' as wet as muck
for all the presidents betwext here and Passamaquoddy
Bay.</p>

<p>"Me nyther," says Amandy Malviny, "I aint so
anxious to ride behind the President as to spile my bunnit
for't."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I aint no frind o' Van Buren. My
fust husband was a stairn, uncountermisin whig, and he
always endeevord to distill his sentiments into me, but
neverstandin' that, Ime a guayne to Utica, and it's jest to
gratificate my dear husband the Deacon. I aint afeard of
a little rain. Ime nyther sugar nor salt, and Ime a
guayne to Utica, I don't ker if the Dragon stands in the
door."</p>

<p>"That's you, wife," says the Deacon, squeezin' my hand.
So he and me and Zebidee, we got in our waggin and rid
off, leavin' Missis Jones and Amandy and Kier to the
Capting's, where they said they meant to stay till the
shower was over.</p>

<p>We had to drive amazin' tight to ketch up with the
republican rottenow, but at last we got tew 'em and druv
into the citty at the hindmost eend of 'em. Instid o'
stoppin' at the hotell, Van Buren went hum to eat dinner
with the gentleman that brung up the hoss for him, and
I heerd (tho' I dident see it) that when he rid up to the

<!-- page 375 -->

door, there was a couple o' very ginteel young wimmen
cum out o' the house and carried him in on a lady's cheer.</p>

<p>"Well," says the Deacon, says he, "I aint a cummin'
clear to Utica to eat dinner with the President, and then
be cheated out on't," so we left our surveyance to the
tavern, and the Deacon and me and Zebidee, we walkt
over to the man's house. Well we knockt to the door,
and nobody dident 'cum, so Zeb he gin a thunderin' kick
and then there was a nigger wench cum.</p>

<p>"Is the President here?" says the deacon.</p>

<p>"Yis, sir," says she.</p>

<p>"Well then, show us into yer settin'-room, we've cum
to dinner." The nigger stared and dident offer to stir.</p>

<p>"Don't ye hear, you black creetur," says I, "show us
into yer settin'-room."</p>

<p>So she opened a door and rushered us into a turrible
nice room. "Now," says I, "go tell yer Missis to set
three more addtitional plates to the table." So she went
off and purty soon the man that fetcht the boss up to
Whitestown, he cum in mighty fierce with a wonderful
ginteel lookin' woman behind him.</p>

<p>"What's the meanin' o' this?" says the man.</p>

<p>"Why, we've cum to eat dinner with the President,"
says the Deacon, says he.</p>

<p>"Have hay," says he. "Well, Ile tell ye another
story. My house aint a tarvern."</p>

<p>The Deacon he was bethunderstruck and darsent say
another word. So I up, and says I, "Mister, I gess if
you knowd who you was a-talkin' tew, you'd be ruther
perliter; this ere's Deacon Gorum; and he's not ony
deacon, but superviser to boot, and Ime his pardner, and
this ere's our son, and we've cum bettern fifteen mild a
purpose to eat dinner with the President."</p>

<!-- page 376 -->

<p>"Have hay," says he. "Well Ime sorry to say we
can't accommerdate ye. My wife haint cookt more'n
enough dinner for she and I and the President, and Mr.
and Missis Boneset, have ye, my dear?" says he, turnin'
to his wife. (She stood there with her honkercher up to
her face a-gigglin'.)</p>

<p>"My! no," says she, "and Ime ferful we shall cum
short as it is, if Mr. and Missis Boneset is very hearty to
eat."</p>

<p>"Whose Mr. and Missis Boneset?" says I.</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes!" says she. "Don't ye know, why
it's the Secretary and Secretaryess of War."</p>

<p>"There, Deacon," says I, "dident I tell ye there'd be
war? Now I reckon the sooner we git hum the better."
Jest then I happened to spy Van Buren a peekin' thro' a
crack in the door, so thinks me, Ile giv him a stirrin' up,
"so," says I, castin' a look of suvering contemp at the
man and his wife, "Ye may go to the Dragon with yer
dinner. I don't want nun on't. I aint no Vanburenite,
and my fust husband wouldent a wiped his old shoes on
Marting. He was as stiff a whig as ever trod shoe
leather, and so be I and so was the Deacon, till Satan
tempted him to go over to t'other side. I s'pose the evil
one reckoned they needed one decent man among 'em."</p>

<p>"Git out o' my house," says the man.</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure on airth," says I, makin' an all
sufficient low kurchy, and walkin' off with oncommon dignitude,
the Deacon and Zebidee follerin'. Well, it was a
rainin' considerable smart, so we went as fast as we could
to where we left our waggin, and got in and rid over to
Elihu Slocum's (he's an intimit frind o' the Deacon's,
moved from our place five years ago; his wife's a very

<!-- page 377 -->

ginteel woman). Well, we went there, and they was terrible
glad to see us; got dinner for us, and treated us
very perlite. But the Deacon was dretful sober&mdash;he felt
awful cheap about bein' used so by that dimocrat and
his wife. But he didn't say nothin' about it afore Mr.
Slocum, and he winked to me not tew, 'cause Slocum's a
whig, and the Deacon know'd he'd bother him to everlastin
about it if he heerd on't. Well, arter dinner Zeb he
went out, and purty soon he cum back, and says he,
"Father, the President's down to the hotell a shakin' hands
with his frinds, don't ye want to go down and see him?"</p>

<p>So the Deacon he said he'd go, and he axt Mr. Slocum
to go. Slocum said he wouldent give a darn to shake
hands with the President, but seein 'twas the Deacon axt
him he'd go. So they went, and byme by they cum
back, and the Deacon lookt considerable chirker'n he did
afore he went; and thinks me, I wonder what's the reason.
Well, it slackt up rainin', and arter urgin' Missis Slocum
to cum and see us, we started for hum. And arter we
was in the waggin and fairly agoin, the Deacon he says to
me, says he, "Well, if I dident eat dinner with the President,
I've had an uncommon perlite reception from him.
We went into the hotell, and purty soon we war introducted.
As soon as the President heerd my name, he
says, says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Ah, Deacon Gorham, I'm delighted to see you; set
down here a minnit.' So I sot down, and he whispered
to me, and says he, 'Deacon, that was a scurvy trick they
sairved ye at my frind's down here. I hope ye don't think
I had any hand in it. Realy, when I peeked into the
door and see how they used ye, and reflected that sittyated
as I was, it was unproper for me to interfere, my sufferins

<!-- page 378 -->

was intolerable. You must cum to Washington next
winter and eat dinner with me at my own table, and bring
yer wife. By the way, she's a splendid woman, I was
very much struck with her appearance; and that son o'
yourn, smart feller that, he'll make a man one o' these
days, and no mistake. Sorry I can't convairse a spell
longer with ye, but I've said more to you than I have to
ary one individdyal to-day. Good-by, Deacon,' 'Good-by,
President,' says I; then we shook hands agin, and I
cum off." Well, we went home, and I tell ye, the Deacon
never told nobody about tryin' to eat dinner with the President,
but he's told more'n a hundred times how he had a
lung conversation with him, and what he said about me
and Zebidee. For my part, Ime a whig, my first husband
was a thoro' guayne whig, and I don't think I shall
ever be anything else; but arter all taint in natur for me
to feel so hard agin the President sence what he said about
me, as I did afore; and I haint made up my mind yit
whether I shall oppose the Deacon's votin' for him next
election or not.</p>
