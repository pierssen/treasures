<p>I had the pleasure of attending a morning soiree at the house of the
celebrated Sir Lytton Edward Bulwer, last week, at which I met several
literary personages, whose names may be familiar to the American public,
and I propose to give you a slight sketch of their persons and peculiarities.
Bulwer has acquired considerable reputation in this country by his novels
and other works, and as he may be known, by reputation, to some of your
readers, I will begin my gallery of daguerreotypes by a slight allusion to
him. Returning to my apartments in the Commercial road, after spending a
delightful evening with a choice set of spirits, at the house of my friend
the Countess of Candelabras, in Rosemary Lane, I found lying upon the
centre table of my apartment a pink card, with a gold border, and looking
at it rather curiously through my eye-glass, by the uncertain light of an
expiring candle, which I had borrowed of my landlady, my surprise may
be judged of, when I inform you that I discovered the name of Sir Lytton
Edward Bulwer in German text. I had no previous acquaintance with Sir
Lytton, excepting having met him once as he came out of the shop of my
eminent friend, the great publisher in Conduit street, whose son, I hear, is
at present in New York. On that occasion I dogged the steps of Sir Lytton,
until I saw him enter the Atheneum Club room, on the border of Oxford
street and Picadilly; and although I waited in the rain more than an hour,
hoping to renew my acquaintance with him when he came out, I was
unfortunately compelled to 'move on,' by the peremptory order of a policeman,
and consequently missed an opportunity of ranking one of the most

<!-- page 103 -->

celebrated men of the day among my intimate friends; and probably wishing
to be presented to the generous-hearted and most credulous people or your
great country, has left his card for me, hoping to get into one of my letters.
It was under these most favorable auspices that I jumped into a cab on
the night of the 1st day of April, a night which will ever be memorable in
my history and hastily ordering the cab-man to set me down at No. 46
Portland Place, the town residence of my friend, I leaned back in the
cab, and tried to compose my mind for the tremendous event, which it
was my fate to encounter. I was roused from my deep reverie, by hearing
a sharp, double-knock at the hall-door of a stately mansion. Collecting my
scattered senses, I sprang from the cab, and rushing with wild impetuosity
up the marble stair-way of No. 46, in the first landing encountered the most
remarkable vision that ever lighted upon the steps of a fashionable mansion.
I need hardly say that this vision was the remarkable author who had
kindly invited me to his house. It was in fact Sir Lytton Edward Bulwer. 'O,
my covey,' said the Baronet, 'how are you?' Having satisfied him on this
head, he immediately overwhelmed me with the most perfectly dazzling
scintillations of his genius that can be conceived. I can only remember distinctly
that he said he had read my letters in the Atlas, and esteemed it the
most fortunate moment of his life when he first became acquainted with me.
I was astonished to find him perfectly familiar with my name, and quite
<i>au fait</i> in all American affairs. He said he had long contemplated a trip to
Boston, and had great admiration for your glorious institutions. He enquired
after all the principal literateurs of America, and was very anxious to know
something about Prof. Ingraham and the celebrated critic Mr. Poe. Sir Lytton
is about thirty-one years old; he is rather stout, slightly pock-marked, and
notwithstanding an impediment in his speech talks with considerable fluency.
Sir Lytton it is well known is the oldest son of a Shropshire baronet, who
lost his life in the battle of Blenheim, under the celebrated F. M. the Duke
of Wellington. Taking me by the arm he ushered me into the drawing-room,
where the greater part of the guests, whom he had invited to meet me, were
already assembled. Here a scene of great brilliancy presented itself to my
view, and I am only sorry that all my Boston friends were not there to
enjoy it. Step for a moment into this richly draperied room, while l sip a
glass of lemonade, with my celebrated host, and take a few notes of the distinguished
company assembled. You see that elderly gentleman, with long white
hair, a rather flushed countenance, and a turquoise ring with the initials
S. R. cut upon the stone, on his forefinger, dancing the cellarius polka, with
a young lady wearing a crimson spencer, and a sea-green robe; see how she
leans her cheek upon his shoulder, while he, on hospitable thoughts intent,
smiles graciously upon her. Well, that gentleman is my friend, the celebrated
poet Sam Rogers, author of the Pleasures of Hope; the young lady is my intimate
acquaintance Miss Joanna Bailie, the daughter of a celebrated Scotch
physician, and the authoress of several agreeable poems. The little man in a
brown coat, who is whispering in the ear of a lady, wearing a sky-blue

<!-- page 104 -->

mantilla, is the celebrated Thomas Moore, author of a volume called Moore's
Melodies; the lady is the Hon. Mrs. Norton, a distant relative, I believe,
of the excellent Governor Norton of Massachusetts. I had made these few
notes, and was just preparing a sketch of the Countess of Blessington, who
I perceived was waltzing with my friend Leigh Hunt, when a gentleman
approached me, and giving my shoulder a most terrific slap, said: 'O, my
boy, how are you?' Looking up, I discovered it was the celebrated William
Wordsworth. He wore a light blue&mdash;But the postman calls, and I must close.</p>

Devonshire Terrace, August 4, 1846.</p>

<p>DEAR F.&mdash;I find that your <i>Mirror</i> answers exactly the purpose which
Burns sighed for, namely, it affords an opportunity for men to see themselves
as other see them. This is the highest and best office of a <i>Mirror</i>.
If some of your great men do not see themselves very accurately reflected,

<!-- page 142 -->

it is because they do not look into your paper. If I were a great man and
an American, and you know I am neither, I am sure I would never look into
your <i>Mirror</i> for fear of seeing myself reflected there. Just turn the surface
of your reflector in an easterly direction, and if the smoke of this great city
is not too thick, you shall catch some likenesses <i>en buste</i> of some of our
celebrities. 'So, steady,' as the mate of the &mdash;&mdash; used to say to the man
at the wheel; 'Keep her so.' Now, what do you see? A <i>neat little cottage</i>,
did you say? Very well. It is a very neat little cottage. Observe, it is neither
white-washed nor painted; the old grey stones of which it is built are
partly covered with moss and partly with ivy; it has a little porch, and square
hooded windows with diamond panes. <i>Where is it?</i> It is on the Edgeware
road, and the spire which you see beyond is St. Cuthbert's-in-the-fields,
where the occupant of this little rustic gem, hight Douglas Jerrold, was
christened and wedded. He loves the old cottage, although he was not born
in it, and the old church, and these are the only old things, saving his venerable
mother, that he does love. You need not enter the cottage to catch a glimpse
of the company within, because the window is swung wide open, and the
perfume of these stock flowers and geraniums is much pleasanter than the
fumes of cigars which the happy looking company are smoking. <i>How many
are there?</i> Five. <i>Who are they?</i> Wait, and you shall know. That rather stout
gentleman with a loose cravat and turn-over collar, with a satin vest, and
a glass in his hand, looking as though he were sitting for a portrait of the
hermit of Bellyfull, is a gentleman whom you know already, although
you see him now for the first time: it is Gilbert Abbot a Beckett. <i>Enough
said?</i> Of course. Sitting at his right is a small ill-natured person, at least
ill-natured in his looks, with greyish hair, a restless black eye, and closed
lips, who rejoices in the name of Douglas Jerrold. He is smoking a pipe,
and the liquid in the silver tankard before him is Barclay &amp; Perkins'
entire; the laughing youth in the sporting coat and satin stock is Horace
Mayhew: you may have heard of him before, or you may not. But whether
or no, you will hear a good deal of him hereafter. He is a rising genius. The
rather coarse-looking person, with chestnut curls and a blue coat, at the
foot of the table, if I may so call any part of a round one, is Mark Lemon.
<i>You don't say so?</i> I do say so. Look at him again as he turns round: now
you see his face; should you think so good-looking a person could have
written so many ill-natured squibs? It is true, however. He is about forty-five
years old, and one of the pleasantest companions you could meet with.
There are some remaining traces in his broad face of his former calling. You
remember he was a publican. I have eaten many a chop at his house in
Oxford street. His thick snub nose, plethoric lips, heavy eyebrows, and
paunchy front, certainly indicate more of the publican than of the wit. But
looks are often deceptive, and they never were more so than in this case.
As he shakes his head and tosses the heavy ringlets from his brow, you see
in his forehead the causes of his power, and why is it that from being an
indifferent publican, he has risen to be one of the most influential editors

<!-- page 143 -->

in England&mdash;for Punch wields more authority than the Times. <i>Who is the
other one?</i> That's I, and I shall say no more about I.</p>

<p>If I had not already taken a place in the steamer for Antwerp to-morrow,
I would not venture to imitate your former partner, so far as to write a public
letter about a private party; for these wags read the Mirror as regular as
though it were printed in Cheapside, and I would not like to brave their
wrath for exposing them. But before I return, they will forget all about
it, and welcome me as heartily as ever. It is Sunday afternoon, always a
holiday with the slaves of the press, and we have been dining on a haunch of
South Down mutton, which was sent to Jerrold by a Sussex squire, as a token
of his admiration for the author of Clover-nook. It was an appropriate
present, and I can testify to the richness of its flavor. Our host is in particularly
good humor, for his weekly newspaper has met with a tremendous
sale. He is one of the most fortunate literary men in England, whatever he
puts his name to succeeds, and the secret of his success is his sympathy with
the middle classes, and his fearlessness in uttering his opinions. You call
yourselves free, in America, and you are so, compared with some nations, but
the freedom of our press would not be tolerated in New York. Jerrold's
Magazine is alread a good paying property, and the contributors to it are
handsomely remunerated. In some instances, I have known twenty guineas
to be paid for a short article. Nothing need be said about Punch; its profits are
enormous. Bradbury and Evans are capital fellows, and they treat their
writers like princes. I had the good fortune to be present at a dinner given
by Mr. Evans, at his villa in Kent, a few weeks since, when I met the whole
corps of artists, engravers and authors engaged on Punch, Jerrold's Magazine,
and the Almanack of the month.</p>

<p>Tom Duncombe and Macready were present, but otherwise it was a strictly
professional party. Some of the gents, knowing I had been in America, chose
to call me a Yankee, and I was quizzed unmercifully, but I stood the fire
manfully, and made a speech in favor of repudiation and slavery. Jerrold
toasted his friend, the author of Puffer Hopkins, whose writings he reviewed
in the Illustrated Magazine, whereupon I was called out to say something
about American literature. The greatest man present, physically at least,
was the incomparable Michael Angelo Titmarsh, the best fellow in the
whole world; he told me that he intended visiting the United States the next
winter, but that he meant to go incog. If he should visit you, he would give
such a work about America, as the old world needs. I was told by a gentleman
present that Titmarsh, whose real name is Thackeray, as you know,
realized an income of about fifteen hundred pounds for his writings. Bradbury
&amp; Evans pay him well for his contributions to Punch, the best of which was
Jeames' Diary. He illustrates his own writings, and is, of course, doubly
valuable on that account. Albert Smith was also of the company; he is a
gentlemanly man in his manners, but his writings are extremely gross and
sketchy. Mrs. Jerrold was there&mdash;the original of Mrs. Caudle. She is a sister
of the celebrated Anna Thillon, the famous violinist. By the by, I must not

<!-- page 144 -->

forget to mention that Jerrold told me that he wanted to engage a New
York correspondent for his weekly newspaper; there is a chance for some
of the unemployed wits who saunter up and down Broadway. He said nothing
about terms, but being an author himself, he of course has a fellow-feeling
for the brethren of the press, and will pay liberally.&mdash;There is nothing new
in literature, but I hear that a young American has just received an appointment
as sub-librarian at the British Museum.</p>

<p class="right">Yours, F. M. PINTO.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;But I forget the news, which is in fact that there is nothing new.
The Cobden memorial has not yet reached the hundred thousand mark, but
it will in the end. There is a growing demand among the common people
for Indian meal, and I hear that slap-jacks and hoe cakes are seen every
morning on the breakfast table at Buckingham palace. Cotton remains about
the same, and the money market is tight in some quarters, and in others, St.
James' st., for instance, rather loose. The new Premier finds favor in all
quarters, and the news from the continent is peaceful, and affairs wear a
pacific aspect, even Palmerston is said to be strongly averse to anything like
a manifestation of a war spirit. Our manufacture and warehousemen are
anxiously looking for news of Sir Robert Walker's tariff. The Queen is not
<i>as usual</i>, but we are momently expecting an interesting announcement in the
Morning Post.</p>

<p class="center">From our London Correspondent.</p>

<p class="right">No. 8, HAGLEY CRESCENT,<br/>

City Road, Aug. 20</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;Your present of hominy and corn meal came safely to
hand by the St. James; Captain M. is a great favorite at the Custom house,
and so he contrived to smuggle it in free of duty. The receipts for cooking,
which were furnished by the professor, were luckily found in the box, for it so
happens that during my short stay in America, I never once saw a dish
composed of Indian-meal, and I was, therefore quite at a loss how to prepare
my trans-Atlantic delicacies. Living as I do in bachelor's apartments, I could
not make up a little party to partake of my luxuries, so I sent the box and
the professor's recipes to my friend Mrs. S. C. Hall, who invited a few
friends to an Indian-corn feast at her delightful cottage in the Oval, Puddleford
common. We had a merry-time, you may be sure. The guests were few,
but choice. To impart an American flavor to the re-union, Charlotte Cushman
and her sister Susan were invited, and they, happily, aided our accomplished
hostess in serving up the meal. A card was sent to Macready, but he was
prevented from coming by the illness of his youngest child. When I arrived
at the cottage, I found Mrs. Hall, <i>tete a tete</i> with a pleasant-looking lady of
middle age, dressed rather gaily for an Englishwoman, but withal having a

<!-- page 145 -->

quiet stateliness of manner, which at first seemed like pride, although after
a few minutes conversation you could discover that it was only the remains
of an early habit of restraint. This was Mary Howitt; her husband, whom I
had not then seen, was absent in Lincolnshire, with his brother James.
Mrs. Howitt, I was gratified to find, knew me very well, by report, and we
were soon conversing with as much freedom as though we had been reared
together. She was wonderfully curious about America, and asked me a
thousand questions about the L's and D's, which I was unable to answer. In
fact, I found that she knew more about America than I did, and in the space
of five minutes, she uttered more American names, than I had heard in a
month; it was quite delightful to hear her. She talks very rapidly, and pronounces
her opinions without the least hesitation, and sometimes says things
that would sound ill-natured from a less amiable person. In a short time after
my arrival, the Cushmans came in a cab; directly on their heels followed
Mrs. Gore, accompanied by R.H. Horne. These were the only literary people
present; when Mr. Hall came home, he brought with him, in his carriage,
Maclise, the Irish artist, George Cruikshank and Edwin Landseer. Maclise
and Hall are inseparable friends, which will account for the extravagant
praises which the Art-Union, of which Mr. Hall is editor and proprietor,
bestows upon this popular artist. I was disappointed in not seeing Leslie, but
I understood from Mrs. Hall that he and her husband had not spoken together
since the Art-Union contained a rather severe criticism on his fresco painting
in the Queen's summer-house, Buckingham gardens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall's cottage is unique in the interior. It is literally crusted with
ornaments of the finest workmanship, the choicest specimens of the manufactories
of Sevres, Dresden, Sheffield and Paris. Every nook and corner
is crammed and jammed with vases, bronzes, scroll-work, medals, pictures,
engravings and statuettes. These are mostly gifts from the manufacturers;
the book-shelves and tables are loaded with the costliest editions of the
most sumptuous books that have been issued in Europe during the present
century; and gift-books from nearly every living author, of any reputation.
Among them I was happy to see a gorgeously bound copy of Puffer Hopkins.</p>

<p>But let us leave all these perishable gim-cracks, and return to the immortal
minds in whose society we find ourselves. Maclise is a serious Irish-man;
if it were not for a slight brogue you could never imagine that he was
a native of Cork. He has large black eyes, and a prodigious development of
his perceptive faculties, which imparts a very marked expression to his
countenance. He talked but little, and seemed to take great delight in listening
to Susan Cushman, who was as full of prattle as a young child. Her sister
was very quiet and gloomy; she wore a bright red sash and a scarlet mantle,
which made her look exceedingly like Meg Merriles, in which character I
saw her a few nights since. Her acting is melo-dramatic and showy, but she
has not impressed me with so high an opinion of her genius as she has done
others. Mrs. Gore is simply an elegant woman, fashionably dressed and easy
in her manners; she talked but little, although she asked me a great many

<!-- page 146 -->

questions about New York, and I fancy got material enough to write an
American novel. She is a smart woman, as you would say, but I cannot
look upon her as a woman of genius. She appeared to entertain a higher
opinion of Mrs. Child, than of any other of our authoresses. Miss Sedgwick
she quite sneered at, but she was enthusiastic in her praise of Mary Clavers.
In fact there is considerable resemblance in the manner of the two ladies,
but I consider the American greatly the superior of the two. Horne enquired
after Mr. Poe, and said that he had received from him a review of 'Orion,' in
some wishy-washy Magazine&mdash;the name of which he had forgotten. I asked
what he thought of Poe as a critic? He replied, 'He is a very good critic for a
lady's magazine.' Cruikshank and Landseer were as full of fun as boys just
from school.</p>

<p>I find that I have already written more than I intended to do, and I shall
have to say more about our pleasant company in my next. I forgot to say that
Horne was very particular in his enquiries about Tuckerman, and expressed
great admiration of that gentleman's thoughts on the Poets, a copy of which
he had in his pocket, and read to the company the paper on Shelley, which
was highly praised by Mary Howitt.</p>

<p>But what has become of the Indian meal?&mdash;Why here it is, smoking hot on
the table; and the merry company are looking at the dish with watery mouths.
How do they like it? O, don't ask. Either the professor made some mistake
in transcribing the recipe, or Mrs. Hall gave her cook wrong directions, for
the mess was voted intolerable by all present but Charlotte Cushman, who
vowed with a grand air, which could become Lady Macbeth, that as it came
from America, she would eat it if it were the deviled tail of an alligator.
And eat it she did. But the rest of us finished with a pudding <i>a la reine</i>, after
a receipt sent to Mrs. Hall by Mons. Soyer, of the Reform Club.</p>

<p>I did intend to give you a description of the latest fashions, a synopsis
of continental news, some reflections on banking and the state of trade, a
little private scandal, and some stale literary news, which has already reached
you in the magazines, after the manner of other London correspondents, but I
have filled up my sheet, and have only room to subscribe myself, unalterably
and truthfully yours,</p>

<p class="center">From our Correspondent.</p>

<p class="right">BRIERLY HALL, England.<br/>

September 15th, 1846.</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;We have had quite an addition to the guests at Brierly,
since my last. The most important arrival was that of Macaulay, last evening.
Lord John Russell was here for a couple of hours, yesterday, but I was
unluckily out with Michel Chevalier, pheasant shooting, and did not see
him. Michel is a <i>first rate</i> shot, as you would say in America. We bagged no

<!-- page 147 -->

less than fifty-four brace of pheasants, besides smaller game. The reporter of
'Bell's Life' was in the neighborhood, and he has sent an account of our
performances to that sporting paper; so that I have had the honor of seeing
my name in a place where I little dreamed of ever encountering it. Michel
has the same <i>Joe Manton</i> with him which he took to America, and says he
values it the more highly for its having been his companion in that <i>magnifique</i>
country. I find that he has a more intelligent admiration of the United States.
than I had supposed him capable of, from reading his work on your country.
If it were not for the fear of giving offence to certain families in New
York, I should be happy to give you an account of his remarks on certain
social parties which he attended here. Perhaps I may, in some future letter,
for lack of more important matter. Michel is a prodigious dandy, and he
wears, on all occasions, and probably in his <i>robe de chambre</i>, the cross of
the legion of honor. But dandyism is very pardonable in a man of wit and
genius. Who ever thought the less of D'Israeli, Bulwer or D'Orsay, for their
fine clothes, or the more of Macaulay, Carlyle and Tennyson, for their
carelessness in dress. Perhaps you would like to hear something of Macaulay,
but I have never been infected with the <i>lues Boswellion&aelig;</i>, and am but an
indifferent hand at retailing other people's sayings. In fact, I hate gossipers,
and the recklessness of some of the letter-writers, who have come on here
from America, in betraying the privacy of social life, has very nearly closed
the doors of every desirable house in Great Britain to American authors.
Being aware of this fact, I furnished Miss F. with letters to Moore, my
friend the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Francis Egerton, and a few others,
that she might not suffer from the indiscretions of her countrymen. However,
I will say a word or two about Macaulay, because he was very anxious in
his enquiries about New York. He was quite surprised to hear of the popularity
of his reviews there, but he did not seem to attach much importance
to them. He said that he wrote in the Edinburgh for money only, having
no thought that his essays would be collected into a volume. I asked him
what he thought of the North American, he replied that he really had
never thought anything at all about it: he had read one number only, and
had an impression that it was rather a faint shadow of the Quarterly. He
asked me what compensation your writers receive for their contributions
to reviews. I told him that I believed they depended mainly upon posterity
for a recompense. To which he merely ejaculated, 'Fools!' He said that he
received fifty pounds for the first article which he contributed to the
Edinburgh Review (that on Milton) and one hundred and fifty for the
last, which was a review of Lyell's travels. He said he had read one of two
numbers of the American Review, and liked it much better than the editor's
Life and Times of Henry Clay, which had been sent to him by the publishers.</p>

<p>His admiration of Webster is unbounded; he said that Webster and
De Berryer are the two greatest forensic orators in the world, and that
Webster excels De Berryer as much as the French advocate excels other
men. His opinion of the great American as a philosophical statesman, however,

<!-- page 148 -->

is rather small. But, confound statesmen, said he, suddenly, do you
know anything of my friend Inman? When I told him of the artist's death
he appeared greatly shocked, and said that he had never made any pretensions
as a critic of art, but he considered Inman as the greatest portrait
painter who had ever visited England. Notwithstanding his immense erudition,
he showed a marvellous ignorance of American affairs. He knew that Mr.
Polk was the President of the Union, but he said he was a good deal puzzled
to find out what office Col. Polk held in the nation. He also asked me if
General Morris had distinguished himself in the Mexican war, and whether
or not Col. Webb had left his editorial chair to join his regiment. He
remembered seeing him once at the house of a friend, and thought him
a fine specimen of a soldier. But the most amusing thing in the world is
to hear Sir Charles, our hospitable host, talk on American affairs.  As he
was an old Pittite, and never misses the annual dinner of the Club, and
always sings the 'Pilot that weathered the storm,' when he is called upon
for a song, which is generally every day after dinner, he feels himself
privileged to talk down all opposition in political debates; but as he has
not read a newspaper, nor been in Parliament since the death of his great
patron, he is, as you may conceive, ludicrously ignorant. He thinks that Mr.
Madison it still President, and when I talk of Polk or Clay, says sneeringly,
'who the &mdash;&mdash; are they?' He has some recollection of the battle of New
Orleans, and says if Packenham had marched his army direct from New
Orleans to Washington, the union jack would now be flying from the top
of the Capitol. When Morpeth or Chevalier attempts to correct his blunders,
he turns upon them and says it is a fine time to be sure, if youngsters like
them pretend to tell him any thing about America. Wasn't he in Parliament
before they were born?</p>

<p>Last night there was a ball at which most of the gentry in the neighborhood
were present. I danced with the dowager Countess of Coalpit, who invited
me to Coalpit Hall, to meet some literary friends she expected from London
the next week; as Mrs. Norton was among them I shall not fail to go.</p>

<p>Elihu Burritt the learned blacksmith, is here distributing receipts for
cooking Indian meal. I have not seen him, but learn that he passed through
this country last week with a knapsack on his back, on foot. Great curiosity
is manifested to see him.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER'S CLUB, LONDON, Sept. 20, 1846.</p>

<p>DEAR F.&mdash;Although there's not a soul in London one cares to associate
with, I have run up here to spend a few days, and attend to some pressing
business. The country houses are all crowded with guests, and the moors are
filled with Peers and members of Parliament, shooting grouse. To-morrow I

<!-- page 106 -->

shall leave for the north, having promised to visit the representative of
McCullum More at Inverary. You shall hear from me in the Highlands. My
friend, the Earl of Eglintoun, will accompany me in my northern tour.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of attending a grand banquet, given by the bankers of
London to the editors of the 'Times,' at the London Tavern. Mr. Joshua Bates,
the father-in-law of M. Van de Weyer, introduced me to Sir Thomas Bering,
with whom I went to the grand banquet. The Lord Mayor presided at the
dinner, and Mr. Walter sat on his right hand. If you have ever dined at the
London tavern, there will be no need of describing the banquet. The highest
idea of a Cockney heaven is a dinner at this famous tavern. On this occasion,
the dinner was of unprecedented elegance. As I cast my eye down the table,
I was gratified to observe an Indian dumpling on a gold dish opposite to
Mr. Bates, who must have thought of the old colony, as he looked upon it.
I had the honor of sitting between Baron Rothschild and Mr. Fonblanque,
of the Examiner; the latter gentleman having read my letter in the Mirror,
asked me some questions about the American press, upon which the Baron
turned round, and asked me if I had ever been in New York, and if I knew
his agent there, Mr. Belmont. I was sorry that I did not, for the great banker's
sake. However, he took a liking to me, and invited me to dine at his villa.
Mr. Fonblanque, out of compliment to me, gave as a toast&mdash;the New York
Mirror and the American Press. I replied in a short speech, giving a few
hints on the ability, independence, high moral character, energy, tact,
enterprise, liberality, and so forth, for which the New York press and the
Mirror in particular is distinguished, and concluded by proposing the press
of London and the 'Examiner.' This brought Fonblanque to his feet, and in
a truly eloquent speech he alluded to the press of New York, as being an
honor to the age and to the nation; and to the Mirror he gave the praise of
being the raciest and pleasantest daily in the world. Sir George Larpent and
some other gentleman present, were very desirous to become subscribers. I
referred them to my friend, Mr. Putnam, who will forward their names to you.
After the dinner was over, Mr. Walter, Fonblanque, and myself went to
Fumigo's divan in St. James st., to enjoy a cigar and talk politics. Fonblanque
and Walter are better informed on American affairs than you could conceive
possible. They understand all the points of difference between the old
hunkers and barnburners, and Greeley-Whigs and Express-Whigs.</p>

<p>Walter said, 'You Yankees may go on conquering province after province,
and talk of extending the area of freedom, but we English will reap all the
benefit.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Fonblanque, 'and for that reason we shall not disturb you in
your course of empire.'</p>

<p>'If you had been content,' said Walter, 'with your original territory and had
liberated your slaves, England would have been shorn of half her greatness,
for she has existed by the folly of your people. You are spending a hundred
millions to open a market for British manufactures in Mexico and California.
You are educating the half-civilized inhabitants of those countries, that they

<!-- page 107 -->

may read English books and newspapers. We are grateful for it. As for your
retaining possession of all your acquired territory, it is impossible. The
boundaries of empire are limited by natural laws, which neither your Col.
Polk nor your General Taylor can overcome. When your Yankees go to
Mexico they will become Mexicans, just as our English become good
democrats when they emigrate to America.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so,' I replied, as I lighted my third cigar.</p>

<p>'And then will come the dismemberment of your States, inevitable from
your form of government.'</p>

<p>'That's a fact.' said Fonblanque.</p>

<p>'But that matters nothing to us.' continued Walter; 'while you are employing
the energies and wealth of your country in your ridiculous way, we will be
manufacturing your broadcloths and sheetings, and writing your novels and
poems.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Fonblanque, 'and I will be enlarging my editions of the Examiner
to supply your market with political essays.'</p>

<p>By this time I had finished my cigar, and throwing the stump into the
grate, I replied&mdash;'That all sounds very plausibly, but you forget that America
advances in wisdom more rapidly than England; that she has long been
in bondage to you from the prejudices of education, but that now she has got
an indigenous population who have learned to trust in themselves. Talk of
reading your books! I perceive that you have no knowledge of American
authors. Who do you think read the works of our Lester, our Ingraham,
and our Poe? As to your political essays, what are they to the leaders in
the Tribune? and have we not, too, a journal which calls itself the Times at
America, and another that calls itself the American Punch? Then, sir, we
have an American Scott and an American George Paul Rainsford James,
besides our Father Matthews of the copyright club.'</p>

<p>These gentlemen, finding that I was getting the best of the argument, pretended
to be in a great hurry to get home, and went off, leaving me alone
with my cigar. But I will write a letter to the editor of the Times, in which
I shall expose his fallacies.</p>

<p class="right">RED LION INN.<br/>

Tamworth, Oct. 10, 1846.</p>

<p>MR DEAR F.&mdash;On going to my lodgings from the Club, last evening, I
found upon my dressing table an invitation from Sir Robert Peel to come
down to Drayton Manor, and spend the shooting season in Staffordshire.
This placed me, as you Yankees say, in a fix, for I had already sent my
travelling baggage on board the Leith smack, Sovereign, intending to embark
the next day for Inverary. But plain Sir Robert Peel is of more consequence
than any Duke whatsoever, so I resolved, after a moment, to cut Argyle, and
devote myself to the great minister. As ill-luck would have it, this was an
unfortunate resolution, but I have the consciousness of reflecting that I acted
for the best, and had no other object in view than to secure my own happiness,
which should be the aim of every reasonable being.</p>

<p>I have no wish to injure Sir Robert, or his accomplished lady, in the
estimation of my countrymen, but truth has ever been my polar star, and I
am resolved never to compromise my integrity, by suppressing a fact. No!
men may call me wayward, fickle, sarcastic or mercenary, neither of which I
am, thank Heaven! but my word shall not be impeached. On that I stake
my hopes of renown.</p>

<p>Before going to bed, I dispatched my <i>valet</i> for my portmanteau, and the
next morning took my departure for Tamworth. It was quite dark when I
reached the elegant mansion of my illustrious friend, but as I was expected,
I found the great hall at Drayton lined with servants in splendid livery, and
I was ushered to my room between a row of lusty fellows, who seemed to
have made it the study of their lives to preserve their good looks, and I
could not help saying, with Sir Andrew Aguecheek in the play, as I looked
at the flunkey who preceded me, to my room, with two wax candles, 'I would
give a crown and I had the fool's leg.'</p>

<p>However, I have generally observed that men with ill-developed heads, are
blessed with very fine calves. There is some comfort in that, for a man
might lose his legs, and still depend upon his head, while the loss of one's
head would leave his legs of very little consequence, let them be ever so fine.</p>

<p>After making my toilet, I descended to the drawing-room, where I found a
foreign-looking gentleman with whom I was quite charmed. It happened
that Sir Robert and Lady Peel had gone to an agricultural dinner, and were
not expected back until after supper. So I talked an hour or two with the
foreign gentleman, and thought him the most entertaining person I had ever
encountered. I found that he knew everything, and could talk me blind;
he wore the cross of the Legion of Honor, from which I inferred, rather than
from his tongue, that he was a Frenchman. Perhaps it is Thiers or Guizot,
I thought. But he was much too good looking to be either of those statesmen.
I asked the butler if he knew him. But he only knew that he was 'one of

<!-- page 109 -->

the big nobs from France.' Big nobs were so common at Drayton Manor,
that the servants never troubled themselves to remember their names. It
might be Count Mole, and the Duc de Fitzjames, or M. Berryer. I could
not discover from his conversation who or what he was. He was very good
looking, full of life and humor, and rather showily dressed. His jewelry I
thought rather profuse. We supped together, and then I retired to rest,
before the return of Sir Robert. The famous <i>chapeau de paille</i> of Rubens,
for which Sir Robert paid $15,000, hung in my room. It is a good painting;
the flesh tints are unsurpassable but take it as a whole, I assure you that
your countryman Page has painted better pictures. But this famous painting
lost all attraction in my eyes, when I discovered hanging by the side of
my bed a portrait of General Jackson, and a copy of the Declaration of Independence.
These had been hung there out of compliment to me, by Lady
Peel. I slept very sound that night, dreaming of freedom and my country.</p>

<p>At breakfast I experienced another proof of the delicate hospitality of
my distinguished hostess; she had served up for me a dish of hominy, and
a plate of Indian slap-jacks. The cook, it appears, had followed a recipe
sent to Sir Robert by Elihu Burritt, for cooking Indian meal, and dreadful
work he made of it. The truth is I could never endure corn-meal in any
shape, but I tried hard to swallow these abominable preparations, for fear
of being thought ungrateful. The English think that Americans can eat
nothing but hominy and slap-jacks. But my hostess attempted to make me
swallow something more unpalatable than this. At dinner I met the agreeable
foreigner with whose conversation I had been so completely charmed
the night before. 'Allow me,' said Sir Robert, as the graceful stranger entered,
'to introduce you to Alexander Dumas.' 'To whom?' I exclaimed,
rising from the table, and assuming an air of proud dignity. 'To my distinguished
friend, Alexander Dumas,' repeated Sir Robert, with his bland
smile.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Sir Robert,' I replied, striving to speak with a calm dignity.
'Is not your <i>friend</i> the descendant of the Marquis de Pailleteir? Sir, I am an
American, a citizen of that free and happy country, and I cannot consent to
degrade myself by sitting at the same table with an African.'</p>

<p>As I uttered these words, this insolent descendent of an African slave
smiled scornfully, and seated himself at the table. Remembering what was
due to myself and my country, I withdrew from the dining-room, followed
by Lady Peel, who begged that I would return. 'Consider,' she said, 'it is
not Dumas, but Sir Robert, that you offend by refusing to sit at table with
one of his friends.'</p>

<p>But this was a point which I could not and would not concede. No, my
country, I love your glorious institutions too well! I wished by my conduct
to convince Europe and Sir Robert Peel, that our National feelings are not
to be tampered with. I accordingly immediately left Drayton, and took lodgings
at the Red Lion Inn, where I am writing this letter. Sir Robert will be
cautioned by this never again to insult an American.</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>I shall start in the morning for London&mdash;having just received a letter
from my friends, Bradbury &amp; Evans, who wish to consult me as to the
most feasible means of putting down the American Punch. There has been
the most tremendous excitement among the Punch writers since they heard
of this American rival. Mark Leman, John Leech, and Goodwyn Barmby
are frightened out of their wits, and think their day is gone by. All the
talk in May fair and among the news venders is about Yankee Doodle. I
shall write to you again from Inverary.</p>

LATER THAN THE STEAMER.</p>

<p class="right">INVERARY, Scotland,<br/>

Oct. 25, 1846.</p>

<p>DEAR F.&mdash;My last letter was dated at the Red Lion, Tamworth, which I
left the next morning after I wrote, and came directly to this place, having
met my friend, the Earl of Eglintoun, at Leith. Before leaving Tamworth, I
was waited upon by the Mayor of the town and some of the civic authorities,
who wished to entertain me at a public dinner. But, good heaven! think of
your friend stuck up at a country dinner, among a set of beer-drinking,
beef-fed Staffordshire farmers, and replying to their touts in a set speech
about Indian corn, for these honest fellows had no other object in view than

<!-- page 111 -->

to hear something upon that subject. But although they had amazed me by
their request, I was determined not to <i>a-maize</i> them in a speech, so I thanked
them for their hospitality, pleading a prior engagement with my friend
Argyle, and left them. As they had set their thoughts upon a dinner, I have
no doubt that they called next upon Sir Robert's friend, Dumas, who probably
would feel flattered by such a compliment, and accept their invitation.</p>

<p>I suppose that you are perfectly familiar with the Highlands and know
all about Inverary. If not I have no intention of enlightening you upon the
subject, for you have only to step into any cheap book-store, and procure
more information for a shilling, than I could write you in a week. McCullum
More, as I call his Grace, the Duke, has a fine estate, a fine castle, and a
fine family, and is, himself, a fine fellow; added to these things he has some
fine company at the castle just now, of whom more anon, and you may
conceive without any very great effort, that I am having a real fine time of
it, and, as you say, no mistake. The first fortnight after my arrival I spent
every day shooting red deer and black cock, of which the forests belonging
to his Grace are full. The weather is getting cool, or rather it is cold, for I
believe it never was warm in the Highlands, but the air is clear as a bell;
the nights are long, blustering and dark; the black rain-clouds settle down
upon the towers of the castle after sunset and envelope us in vapor, which
the closed casements and large fires hardly dissipate. We are literally
children of the mist. But there is a zest to mere animal life here which I
never experienced before, and time passes away with too great rapidity.</p>

<p>The Duke himself, although he has the finest game preserves in Scotland,
never fires a gun. He is a man of great humanity and kind feeling, and takes
more delight in rendering his tenants happy than in killing grouse. Kit
North has been here the past ten days; Jeffrey took his departure yesterday.
Among the uninvited guests who have strayed into the enclosures of the
castle, who should appear yesterday but the Miss F. and her two friends
whom I met at the Howitt's in London. They had a little boy with them
who said he wanted to see the man that Walter Scott put into his novels.
The Duke good-naturedly patted the child on the head, and laughed heartily
at the joke. But thinking that his precociousness was rather too marvellous,
I said, "My little fellow, who told you to say so?" "Mamma." he replied.
I begged his Grace not to think hard of my country on account of the
<i>niasiries</i> of any of the sight-seers, who called themselves Americans, and
added, all is not gold that glitters. To which his Grace replied, "I have seen
nothing yet from that quarter which I should be likely to mistake for gold."
Now this was more than I had bargained for, and I didn't like it; but it won't
do to quarrel with a Duke, particularly when one is eating his game and drinking
his wine, so I merely bowed, and resolved to have my revenge when I
publish my "Scraps from Scotland." The Duke asked Miss F. and her friend
to spend the night at the castle&mdash;I believe on purpose to mortify me, and
they accepted his invitation. There happened to be more company than
usual at the castle, so dinner was served in the banqueting hall, a room of

<!-- page 112 -->

majestic proportions, and grandly ornamented with a multitude of family
trophies, consisting of banners, helmet, swords, armor and lances, interspersed
with family portraits; the display of plate was regal, and the
spectacle of pine apples and oranges on the side tables reminded me of the
stage banquets in Macbeth. But the fruit at McCullum More's was genuine,
rich and juicy. It was all raised in the conservatory at Inverary; every pine-apple
must have cost a small fortune. The guests at the dinner exceeded two
hundred, and at the back of each chair stood a highlander, in the original
costume of the clan, while two grey-headed pipers, paraded up and down
the hall, in full dress, during the repast. Some of these highland servants
were models of manly beauty; Miss F. fastened her eyes on a lithe young
Gael at my back, and seemed to be quite enamored of his beauty. After
dinner, we retired to the library, and I soon discovered Miss F. in earnest conversation
with Kit North, who had drank two or three bottles of claret,
and was as full of mischief as in the palmiest times of the Noctes.</p>

<p>I trembled for my countrywoman, but she appeared to be quite unconscious
of her danger, and I discovered, to my dismay, that she had
opened upon his criticisms on Goethe.</p>

<p>Old Kit's eyes were full of fun and fire; they emitted a laughing light
out of their corners which penetrated to one's heart, and seemed to warm
it; his iron grey locks hung over his broad shoulders, and his cravatless neck
and overturned collar gave a strangely wild aspect to his countenance. I was
not near enough to hear what Miss F. was saying to him, but I was amused
in watching the varied expression of his countenance as he listened to her.
At first he opened his eyes wide, and held back his head in unaffected
astonishment, then he smiled, and at last burst into a roar of laughter which
would have startled the deer in Lochabar, if the wind had not been so
high at the time.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the confusion to leave the Marquis of Breadalbane,
who held me by the button, and contrived to slip into close neighborhood
with the two great critics.</p>

<p>"Then that is your opinion of me?" said old Kit.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Miss F.; "I have long thought so. I have discovered a unity
of feeling, a profound depth of design in your articles, which seem to soar
upward to the aloofish position of my own, like two birds mating in the air."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Kit, "Ah!</p>

<p>"And when that beautiful prattler, Tennyson, whom I introduced to my
countrymen, called you crusty Christopher, I said no, he is trusty Christopher."</p>

<p>"Very well, very well," said Kit; "but pray tell me in what particular things
you have discovered this agreement, for I have never suspected myself of
being an ass; but Donald alone knows what I have done after my mutchkin
of whiskey."</p>

<p>"Your sentiments on Lowell, the poet, fully coincide with my own." said
Miss F.</p>

<!-- page 113 -->

<p>"Ah! and are we the only critics who agree in our opinion of that, youngster,"
said old Kit.</p>

<p>"We are." said Miss F.</p>

<p>"No!" I exclaimed, for I thought it time to interfere, "there is one other
person in the world who has spoken ill of that true poet; namely, the
author of Puffer Hopkins, and a precious trio you are."</p>

<p>"True, very true," said Miss F., "there are three of us; my friend, the
author of poems on man, and other humorous writings, makes up the third."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Pipers were introduced just at that moment, and the
company began to caper and dance strathspeys. Old Christopher leaped into
the floor and caught Miss F. by the hand, and swore she should dance a
Highland fling with him. The Pipers struck up their wild music, and these
distinguished critics began to cut the most extraordinary capers that ever
were witnessed in the Highlands. They danced so wildly, and with so little
regard to the feelings of the spectators, that the Duke was at last compelled
to stop the pipers to put an end to their extravagances.</p>

<p>What happened after this I will put in my next letter.</p>

London, November 1, 1848.</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;You will he surprised to see my letter dated in London, of
course; when I wrote last, I was at Inverary, where I intended to remain at
least a fortnight longer. But I was compelled to quit that ducal retreat for
a similar cause to that which drove me from Tamworth. My object in
coming to England, you very well know, was neither to eat corn bread, nor
be bored by my own country people. But a different impression appears to
exist in the minds of all my friends. At the very first dinner party to which
I was invited, after my arrival in London, at Devonshire House, I was
horrified at the sight of an Indian dumpling, placed directly under my nose,
and which I ate because it was meant as a compliment. Then a friend in the
city, Mr. Wigglesworth, must take me to see the great American dwarf, and
another insisted upon carrying me to see Charlotte Cushman the American
actress. I left my card with the American minister, of course, and there
hoped that the matter might end. But England is completely Americanized
as well as <i>amaized</i>; and Yankees may adopt for a motto,&mdash;<i>c&aelig;lum, non animum,
mutant qui trans mare current</i>, when they visit this country, as the English
do when they visit ours. Wherever I went during the summer I could hear
of nothing but the Hutchinson family; or the American blacksmith, who
could speak fifty-two languages and was on a mission of peace scattering
'olive leaves' and receipts for making Indian corn bread; in all the towns
were placards announcing the Virginia melodists and the great American
singer Mr. Henry Smith. I called upon Jerdan, of the Literary Gazette,
and found him trying to read 'Poems on Man, by Cornelius Matthews,'
which he said he had just received from that distinguished author; on
visiting the Howitts I met the new American celebrity, Miss F., whom I
also encountered in Scotland, where I thought myself secure from interruption
by any of my wandering countrymen.</p>

<p>But the very day after writing my last letter, on returning from a hard
day's sport with Eglintoun and half a dozen German princes who had but
recently arrived at the castle, I met the Duke's <i>valet</i> in the hall, and asked
what arrivals there had been, in our absence. He told me that one of the
Douglasses, from America, a very famous gentleman, was then in the library
with his master. Well, said I to myself, as I dressed for dinner, a Douglas
has a right here to be sure, if he <i>is</i> an American. I couldn't call to mind
any celebrity of that name, but had a glimmering recollection of rich family
of Douglasses on Long Island, and made up my mind to have a regular
agricultural lecture on Indian corn. I knew that the Duke took a lively
interest in the subject, although it is not possible to introduce the culture
of it in the Highlands. However, I like to appear well before my countrymen,
so I took unusual pains with my dress, and being a little longer than I
should have been, I did not get down into the library until the guests had all
been seated at dinner. I took my seat at the foot of the table, so far removed

<!-- page 115 -->

from the head, where the stranger sat, by the side of the Duke, that I
could not clearly distinguish his features, for you know that I am near
sighted, and I said to a jolly-looking Scotch Doctor of Divinity who sat near
me, 'Pray, who is this Douglas that I hear has just arrived from America?'</p>

<p>'I do not preceesely know who he is,' replied his reverence, 'but he is dark
enough to be a relation of the family, and a lineal descendant from the black
Douglas himself.'</p>

<p>'Indeed,' I replied, 'doubtless he is a relative of his Grace. I remember
his family very well;' for I saw from the attention paid him that he was a
person of consequence, whom it might be desirable to know on my return.
A relation of the Douglas family was not to be slighted, if he was an
American, and I meant to know him.</p>

<p>'Well, sir,' said the divine, 'he is no better than a Phillistine, he has made
a division in our Chaarch, and he is trying to make us send back the money.
But we have got hold of the siller, and mean to keep it.'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course,' I said, not understanding the drift of the venerable
old file's speech; and to prevent his discovering my ignorance, I turned the
subject, and began to talk about red deer.</p>

<p>When he joined the ladies in the drawing room the duke approached me
and said, 'Mr. Pinto, I am proud to have the privilege of introducing you
to your distinguished countryman, Mr. Douglas.'</p>

<p>'It gives me great pleasure,' I replied, 'to meet an American Douglas in
the halls of his ancestors.'</p>

<p>Judge of my surprise and indignation, when I reached out my hand to my
distinguished countryman, to find him a dark mulatto. In two words, it
was no other than the notorious runaway slave, Frederick Douglas, who has
had the assurance to deliver lectures here against the institutions of his own
country; and who drove several venerable Doctors of Divinity out of Convent
Garden Theatre by his harrangues, when they had come all the way from
America to attend some World's Convention about something or other.
My blood was at boiling heat, in a moment, and drawing myself up at my
full length, I said with a proud air to his Grace, before all his noble guests;
'Sir, as the representative of a free and enlightened country&mdash;as a republican&mdash;I
resent this insult. I find that the days of exclusiveness and gentility are
gone, and in their place those of reformers and abolitionists and amalgamations
have come. The glory of Europe has departed. I will return to
my own country.' This cut them to the quick, and to disguise their feelings
they set up a loud laugh. But I was determined to mortify them still more,
and immediately walked grandly out of the castle, with the intention of going
directly to the inn. I took nothing with me but my hat, and stalked proudly
across the lawn towards the road which leads into the village. The night was
dark and cold, and soon a thick fog set in, and I lost my way. But I scorned
to cry for assistance, and walked straight on, and presently found myself
nearly up to my middle in a bog. With great difficulty I got upon firm
land again, and being completely bewildered, and enveloped in mist, I sat

<!-- page 116 -->

down on the wet grass, and tried to see some Ossianic forms sweep by,
it being a very suitable night for them, but without success. Then remembering
the cause of freedom, for which I had deserted a lordly castle, I
chaunted Smollet's ode:</p>

<p class="small">Thy spirit Independence let me share,<br/>

Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye,<br/>

I'll brave the tempest, with my breast all bare,<br/>

Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.</p>

<p>It was very appropriate to my situation, and gave me considerable comfort,
but still I was wet, and cold and sleepy. In similar exercises I spent the
whole night, and reached the 'Duke's Arms,' the name of the inn at Inverness,
in time for breakfast.</p>

<p>The next morning, I sent for my portmanteau, and started immediately
for London, where I arrived in safety, a wiser and better, but not a sadder
man.</p>

<p class="right">Yours, &amp;c. F. M. PINTO.</p>

<p>N.B. I have not yet decided where to spend the Christmas holidays. I
have a dozen or two of invitations, and shall wait until they all come in,
before I make a decision.</p>

Kent, Nov. 4. 1846.</p>

<p><i>My dear F</i>.&mdash;I am spending a week or two at the parsonage of my
bachelor friend, W&mdash;&mdash;, for the sake of retirement and quiet. Here I find
nothing more disturbing than a few volumes of old sermons&mdash;which, by the
way, disturb nobody, for nobody disturbs them&mdash;a cup of tea and a slice
of toast in the morning, a boiled fowl and a glass of port for dinner, and
a cup of tea and a muffin at night. W&mdash;&mdash; is so much engaged in his

<!-- page 117 -->

parochial duties, his incumbency being but six months old, that I am left
to follow my own inclinations, which are by no means violent. I walk a
little, talk a little, write a little, and sleep a good deal. So wags the world
with me at present.</p>

<p>A few days before leaving London I called at Wiley &amp; Putnam's, which I
have found a very pleasant lounge since I have been here&mdash;Putnam being a
capital good talker, as well as a good fellow every other way&mdash;and there
I found a note lying for me. I did not recognize the hand writing at the
first glance, but upon opening it found it to be from an old friend. As such
letters are not received every day by every body, I will copy it for your
benefit:&mdash;</p>

<p>'25, CURZON ST.</p>

<p>'<i>Dear Pinto</i>,&mdash;I am going to be married, privately, to-morrow morning.
Don't say a word about it. A few friends will be present, and you must come
and see me off. The ceremony will take place at Finsbury chapel, at 10
o'clock; and there will be a little collection at my lodgings afterwards: no
stuffing, though&mdash;but a few bells and pomegranates.</p>

<p>Yours, R. BROWNING.'</p>

<p>'Browning married!' said I, in amazement&mdash;'what can it mean?' There
was nothing unusual in a gentleman of five and thirty getting married, but I
had never heard that my friend had any flame in his thoughts, and I was
of course all anxiety to know who was to be the poet's wife, or where a
man of his fastidious fancy had found a Pippa to match his 'passes.' So I was
on the ground at the appointed hour, you may be sure. It was one of those
dismal dripping November mornings, when all London is hid in a dense yellow
fog, and sentries are posted to guard every convenient place for hanging
one's self. As I got out of my cab I discovered several other cabs at the
door of the chapel, and quite an assemblage of dripping umbrellas. The
chapel was so dark that the gas burners had been lighted, and the place
looked as dismal as though preparations had been made for a funeral. How
English poets can ever have the audacity to introduce such bright immortals
as Cupid and Hymen into their epithalamiums is a puzzle to me.
Their absurd practice of performing the marriage rites in some mouldy old
chapel ought to be the death of poetry. However here was a poet's marriage;
but it looked prosy enough. There was quite a crowd of people around the
chancel, whose faces I did not take the trouble to inspect very closely, not
expecting to recognise an acquaintance among them&mdash;for although 'Toris
and I' had long been friends, I knew nothing of his family. Presently the
unhappy gentleman whose appointed hour had come, walked up the aisle
with a lady leaning on his arm who was so closely wrapped up that I could
not distinguish her features. 'Poor fellow!' I said to myself as I heard him
say, in a faltering voice, 'I, Robert, take thee, Elizabeth.' &amp;c. &amp;c. It was
soon all over with him, and as I rushed up to congratulate him and take a

<!-- page 118 -->

glance at his bride, judge of my surprise in beholding Elizabeth Barrett
in the person of his wife! She was pale and agitated, but apparently
well pleased. I now perceived that the friends who had come to witness
this extraordinary union were all old acquaintances. There was Miss F., to
begin with, who made quite a speech&mdash;the only part of which I could
distinctly hear was something about 'deep significance, aloofishness, union
of immortals, woman's rights, &amp;c. &amp;c.' Wordsworth, who had come from
Rydal on purpose to be present at the ceremony, and who said to me in a
whisper that he hoped Bob and Lizzy understood each other better than the
world understood them&mdash;Hunt, Horne, Proctor, Tennyson, Goodwyn
Barmby, and the everlasting Howitts. Besides these, Mr. Rogers, and Bancroft,
our new minister, arrived just as the ceremony was ended.</p>

<p>We all hurried out of the chapel as quick as possible and drove to the
bridegroom's lodgings, in Curzon street. Horne, having come afoot, took a
seat in my cab, and told me the particulars of the courtship. The bride, you
probably know, has been an invalid from her youth, and during the
greater part of her life has been shut up in a dark room, with a few choice
old gallants named &AElig;schylus, Homer, and Euripides. These she was sufficiently
partial to, but having a wish to see something of living men, she
took a ramble last summer through Wales, and stopping one night at the
little village of Gwddrr, she found Browning with a Welsh rabbit before
him, making the outlines of a soul's tragedy, on the table cloth. What followed
was simply the old story of nature and art. They fell in love with
each other, and at last are married, in spite of their friends, who have
done all they could to prevent it. She has the advantage of him in point
of years, to a considerable extent, exactly how far, I do not know, and
therefore refrain from stating, as I wish to be exact in all the facts which I
put into my letters.</p>

<p>We found a pleasant apartment and a showy table set out, with plenty
of water and flowers, and some seed cakes. It would not be generous to
give a description of a poet's wedding feast, and I am averse to entering
people's houses to detail their modes of living to the world.</p>

<p>We had a good deal of quiet merriment, and a great many quotations,
and I suppose that it was the nearest approach to the flow of reason and
the feast of soul that has ever been witnessed on this earth. Not being
a poet myself, I am not ashamed to acknowledge that I would have been
very glad to exchange some of the scraps of poetry, which were so freely
handed round, for a mutton chop, or a broiled herring.</p>

<p>After we had sat at the table some minutes, Mr. Rogers filled his tumbler
with water, and proposed the health of our 'distinguished visitor, the American
Ambassador.' All eyes were immediately turned towards the distinguished
historian, when, to our amazement, up jumped Miss F., and said she
thanked the gentleman for his good intentions; her health had been pretty
well, excepting a cold, which she caught while spending the night on the
top of Ben Lomond; she was rather surprised at the notice which had been

<!-- page 119 -->

paid her, because from her aloofish position she could not hope to attract
the attention of common minds. In returning the compliment, she begged
leave to propose the health of her friend, the author of "Puffer Hopkins."</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft immediately left the table, muttering something about asking
Mr. Polk to be recalled, and the morning being far advanced, we all left, in
a flurry. The happy couple leave for Italy, to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right">Your's truly, F. M. PINTO.</p>

<p>P.S. I begged the autograph of Mrs. Browning, for L.G., which you will
find enclosed.</p>

<p class="center">From our Travelling Correspondent.</p>

<p class="right">MYTTON HALL, DORSET,<br/>

December 5th, 1846.</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;I informed you in my last that I should leave Birkenhead
the next morning on pedestrian tour, with the design of familiarising myself
with the habits of the lower order of the people of England. I left my hotel
with a small carpet and an umbrella, and made at once for the hedges and
cottages. My spirits expanded at every step, and the peasantry of Cheshire
appeared to me in very charming condition, as I saw them in the grayish
light of a winter morning going to their daily labors. You who are used to
the dry, barren look of an American winter, with a keen northwest wind
screeching through the leafless trees of the forest, can have no idea of the
green and mellow aspect of December in England. What do you think of my
gathering a bunch of yellow field flowers in December? You don't believe it, I
know. But it is true that I did: and any John Bull of your acquaintance will
assure you that I might have done so. Well, I walked, and walked, and
walked, my spirits expanding, as I said before, at every step until they had
swelled to that degree that in the enlarged state of my mind I grew ambitious,
and resolved to write a hook of travels for Wiley &amp; Putnam's American Series,
to be called "<i>Peeps by a Pedestrian, or England seen with an Umbrella and
a Carpet-bag</i>." But presently I grew hungry, and then I grew tired, and being
overtaken by a wagoner, I begged a ride, and found that the wagon was
going to Chester, and as the wagoner seemed by his dress to belong to that
class known as the people, I thought it would be a good opportunity to
study his character while relieving myself by a ride in his vehicle. This
individual wore a coarse brown linen blouse, very elaborately stitched with

<!-- page 120 -->

blue thread about the shoulders, corduroy small clothes, grey woolen stockings,
and a round drab hat. I asked him if he had ever heard of America&mdash;he
replied in his uncouth dialect that he had, and wished he could go
there himself, as he had understood it was the best part of England, and
that every man had a plenty to eat there. To my inquiry whether he suffered
from hunger himself often, he replied that he was hungry then, for he had
eaten nothing for his breakfast but a quartern loaf and a couple of pounds
of cheese, with a mug of ale. The ignorance of this man was frightful. I
asked him how he liked the Queen. He said the Queen was a tidy body,
but he should like her better if she didn't put so much water in her beer.
"Put water in her beer!" I said. "Aye." replied this specimen of the people,
"her half-and-half is no better than swipes." "Pray what do you know about
the Queen's beer?" I said. "As to that," he replied. "I have drank enough
of it&mdash;I always sleeps in the Queen's Arms in Chester." The Queen's Arms,
you must observe, is the name of the inn at which the man lodged, and the
landlady was the only queen he knew anything about. On my asking him his
opinion of Prince Albert, he said, "I suppose you mean him that's King of
America." It was no use talking to such a loon, so I rode the remainder of
the way in silence, and when I alighted at the "Victoria," in Chester, I
popped directly upon the Marquis of Westminster, whom I had seen in
London, and he insisted upon my going with him to Eaton Hall. Being by
this time heartily tired of foot-travelling, and having seen enough of the
lower orders, I very gladly accepted his lordship's invitation, and jumped
into his brougham with my umbrella and carpet-bag. The hall is but a very
short drive from Chester, and we arrived there just as the lamps were
lighted. I had but time to dress when dinner was announced, and as I had
swallowed nothing since breakfast, I enjoyed my first meal in this Eat-on
house with an unusual relish.&mdash;It was, in truth, the best dinner I have eaten in
England. I do not know the name of the Grosvenor cook, but I am sure
that he is superior to Soyer, as an artist.</p>

<p>Eaton Hall is one of the chief shows of this part of the country, and
being easily come at from Liverpool, is probably visited by a greater number
of Yankees than any other house in England. It is a very large mansion,
built of a whitish kind of stone in what is called a Gothic style; and if it
were possible for wealth to make amends for the want of taste, it would be
a fine building, for it has cost an enormous sum. The captains and mates
of the New York packets go out to Chester of a Sunday for the purpose of
seeing Eaton Hall, and return thinking they have seen a Gothic castle. But,
with all its magnificence, it bears very little more resemblance to a Gothic
Castle than any of the chapels in the 5th Avenue do to Gothic churches.</p>

<p>The next day after my arrival at Eaton Hall, Lord Robert Grosvenor, the
only son of the Marquis, came down from London, bringing with him a
celebrated literary gentleman, whom I had a strong desire to see. Sauntering
into the library, after having taken a stroll through the conservatories, I
saw a slender gentleman, dressed in a rather jaunty manner, with a light blue

<!-- page 121 -->

coat and silver buttons, with a green shade over his eyes, examining an
illuminated copy of Froissart.  There was no other person there, and as I
entered he looked up from the book and said: "Ah! I presume this is the
celebrated Mr. Pinto, from America? "The same," I replied with an honest
blush, at hearing myself called "celebrated" by a stranger. "Well," he said,
"I am the celebrated Mr. James, the novelist. I am happy to see the countryman
of Cooper, Ingraham, and Hopkins."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed, grasping him by the hand, "do I behold the real
G.P.R. James, the author of that prolific novel which has appeared under so
many different names?"</p>

<p>"The same, sir," he replied, embracing me warmly; "pray, Mr. Pinto,
are my works read in America?"</p>

<p>"Your work, I presume you mean," I replied: "why, my dear sir, it is
published once a month regularly by one of our great publishers, and always
with a new title. The last time I think it was called Morley Ernstein. Can
you tell me what it will be called next?"</p>

<p>"I have already chosen the name of Beauchamp," he replied, "don't you
think it a good novelesque name?"</p>

<p>"Admirable," said I. "Now let me ask you, Mr. James, where you obtained
that brilliant idea of beginning your novel by describing elaborately a
horseman and so forth, who might have been seen at the close of an autumnal
day? and also allow me to enquire whether or not anything of the sort ever
was seen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," said the great author; "why that is a trick of my
confounded amanuensis, who is a shocking mannerist. I observe that your
distinguished countryman, Mr. Simms, has copied that, as well as the other
little faults of my novels, very faithfully. Do you know that my publisher once
accused me of issuing one of my novels under the name of Simms? Fact.
Somebody sent him a copy of Guy Rivers, and he swore I wrote it. But, by
the way, did you ever seen such a piece of malice as this?&mdash;(<i>taking a copy of
Yankee Doodle from his pocket</i>.) Some stupid fellow has been trying to
injure your country by issuing this thing as an American reality. But the hoax
is too transparent. It is Cockney all over. Don't you see how entirely English
the whole thing is, and what a palpable fraud it is?"</p>

<p>To hide my morfification and blushes at the sight of the dreadful affair,
I pretended to be choking; and very happily Lord Robert came in the next
moment, and relieved me by changing the subject.</p>

<p class="center">From our Travelling Correspondent.</p>

<p class="right">TRAVELLER'S CLUB,<br/>

<i>London, Jan. 5</i></p>

<p>MY DEAR F.,&mdash;After spending my Christmas at Slashford Hall, the family
seat of my friend, the Marquis of Bloomsbury, I am again in London, and
at my favorite club, the Traveller's, as you will see by the date of my

<!-- page 149 -->

letter, where I find myself quite at home. There was a house full of good
company at Slashford, and among them two men whom you would like
to meet, Hallam and Lockhart. The first of those gentlemen was rather
shy of me at first, on hearing that I was an American, and treated me with
a degree of hauteur that I was determined to overcome, and which I finally
succeeded in doing, by quoting a passage from his constitutional history.
After we had become thoroughly acquainted, he said to me, 'I will frankly
confess to you, Mr. Pinto, that I was determined before meeting you, to
cut every American that I might encounter.'</p>

<p>'On account of the Pennsylvania bonds, I suppose?' said I.</p>

<p>'Not at all.' said the great historian, 'I have always condemned the
disposition of my countrymen to visit the sins of a nation on an individual
citizen, and even Sydney Smith and I had a quarrel on this very subject,
but a week before his death. No, Sir, the cause of my dislike to your
country is more personal. It originated in the reading of an essay entitled
'A few Homeric Nods in Mr. Hallam,' written by a pains-taking, prying
countryman of yours, Mr. William A. Jones, whose essays were presented
to me by the Bishop of Oxford.'</p>

<p>'But was not Mr. Jones right?' I said.</p>

<p>'Yes.' said Lockhart, who had been listening to the conversation, 'he was;
but my friend Hallam is like all authors, and hates those who tell him of
his mistakes.'</p>

<p>By the way. Lockhart himself hates every thing American, and since
they have begun to use our bread-stuffs so generally, he will eat nothing
but Scotch oat meal, lest he should by accident swallow some American
bread. One day at dinner there was a dish of remarkably fine pippins on
the table, and Lockhart was so delighted with their appearance and flavor,
that he ate three of them. Upon enquiring of his noble host if they were
raised upon his own estate, the learned reviewer was informed that they
were Newtown pippins, which had been ordered from Mr. Pell, of Pelham,
in the State of New York. The looks of the poor wretch, who was as much
chagrined as though he had been praising the wrong book in his Review
by mistake, caused us all to laugh at him; but the next day he had his
revenge, by writing an abusive article on the speech of the pure-minded
and consistent Daniel Webster, which he published in the Times. Mr. Walter,
the editor of the Times, told me that he was unwilling to admit any thing
into his paper derogatory to the character of so great a man as Mr. Webster,
but he was afraid of offending Mr. Lockhart, by refusing.</p>

<p>There has been an outburst in indignation in all the literary circles
against America that I fear will not very soon subside. When Miss F.
visited Stratford-upon-Avon, she spent a night in the house in which
Shakspeare was born. The inhabitants were all greatly delighted with
the enthusiasm which she displayed for their celebrated townsman, and
on being asked if his works were read in America, she told them that all
her countrymen, excepting only the cannibals, made it a religious duty to

<!-- page 150 -->

read his works four hours every week-day, and to devote the whole of
Sunday to the same object. But they were to have a still further realizing
sense of the devotion of America to Shakspeare, for it was discovered after
her departure that she had purchased Shakspeare's house of the corporation
of Stratford for the purpose of shipping it to America. Workmen are now
employed in removing it to Bristol, whence it will be shipped to New
York, where it will probably arrive in the spring, and be set up in the
Park like the <i>Maison de Lorette</i>. The price paid for this inestimable relic
was &pound;1,350 10s. 6d. sterling. The poker which Geoffrey Crayon used was
sold with the house, but I have had the good fortune to secure one of
the cinders of the fire which he stirred, and you will find it in the box
which I send marked 'G.C.'</p>

<p>The English, who profess to have a great admiration for Shakspeare,
although nothing can induce them to go and see one of his plays acted,
are very much excited about this sale of his house, and very active measures
have been taken to prevent its removal. Nothing else has been talked about
at the clubs for some time, and the Home Secretary has been appealed to,
but he refuses to interfere. I met Forster, of the Examiner, yesterday at a
dinner party at Mr. Fonblanque's, who told me that Macready, Payne
Collier, Charles Knight, Kenny Meadows, and the whole body of the
Shakspeare Society had resolved to follow the house across the Atlantic and
share its fate. But when they hear that it is to be inhabited by its purchaser,
perhaps they will think better of their rash resolve.</p>

<p>Last night I had the pleasure of meeting my old friend, Dr. Lardner, and
his accomplished lady, formerly Mrs. Heaviside; it was at the house of
a nobleman of high rank; (<i>the only houses, by the way, at which I visit</i>)
and while I was practising my gouty toe in the Polka with the daughter
of an unmarried Earl, (<i>I never dance with any girls less than Earls' daughters</i>)
that excellent and fashionable prelate, Bishop Luscombe, approached me
with Mrs. L. on his arm to introduce her to my partner. I immediately held
up my hand to <i>Cellarius</i>, who was leading the band, as a signal for the
music to stop while the introduction took place, and as an expression of
good feeling on the part of the Bishop, I was presented to Mrs. L., and
thus became acquainted with that estimable lady who had the heroism to
desert her husband and children for the man she chose to love. Of course
no one will misinterpret my readiness to be presented to Mrs. L., who knows
my admiration of virtue in the abstract, and how zealously I have always
defended the character of women when aspersed by the public.</p>

<p>By the way, speaking of Bishops, Luscombe and I are on the best of
terms with each other; we are quite hand-and-glove friends. I met him
first in Paris, where he forms the centre of aristocratic and fashionable
society (<i>in which I always move, entre nous</i>)&mdash;he reminds me very much
of my pet Bishop in America, O&mdash;&mdash;, to whom he bears a strong resemblance.</p>

January 21.</p>

<p>MY DEAR F&mdash;The Queen having opened Parliament earlier than usual
this season, every body has left the country and come up to town, otherwise
I should have remained a few weeks longer at Chesterfield House, where I
dated my last letter, and where I enjoyed myself exceedingly with D'Orsay,
Maidstone, Dr. Lardner and one or two Earls' daughters, unmarried, of course.
They say there is great distress among the people for lack of corn, but I
have seen nothing of it. The dinners were never better than now, and as
for corn, I should be much distressed if I had to eat it. I dined at the Reform
Club yesterday with Tom Duncombe and two or three other fashionable
radicals, and I never sat down to a better table, excepting once, and that
was at your New York Hotel; <i>entre nous</i>, Monnot may not be able to
write so good a book as Soyer has done, but he sends up quite as good a
dinner. Soyer, you probably know, is the presiding genius of the Reform
Club; although he is only <i>chef de cuisine</i>, he is the chief prop of the
concern. By the way, Tom Duncombe intends paying a visit to New York
this coming summer, for the express purpose of eating a canvas-back
duck, and drinking the Saratoga water. I shall not let him know that canvas
backs don't fly in summer, for fear that he should not go over. He is a
terrible radical in his politics, but I hardly think he would figure to advantage
in Tammany Hall. On going to my lodgings in Harly street a few nights
since, I found the following note lying upon my dressing table: '<i>Lady Morgan's
compliments to Mr. Pinto, and will be proud of his company at her house in
Baker street to-morrow night, to meet half a dozen distinguished friends</i>.'
Although I was already three invitations deep for that very night, and
among the rest an invitation to dine with Mr. Bates, at whose house I
should have met his charming daughter, Madame Vandever, yet such was
my regard for the 'wild Irish girl' that was, the brilliant authoress that is,
that I gave up all other engagements for her sake. She has a very pretty,
but a rather small house in Baker street, and, as you might expect, from
the taste she displayed in her 'Italy' and 'France,' it was furnished to a
charm. However, I did not go there for the sake of the upholstery, but for
her sake, and to see her distinguished guests. The latter I could have well
spared. The first and second lions were our Minister, Mr. Bancroft, and
his Secretary, Mr. Broadhead. There were, besides, Mr. Jerdan, the editor
of the Literary Gazette; an Irish author of whom I never heard before, named
Blaney; a Polish refugee, whose name I could neither speak nor write; an
Italian, ditto; two Spaniards; a Unitarian clergyman; Goodwyn Barmby, who
writes for Douglass Jerrold, and Mr. Lockhart. There were some ladies
whose names I have forgotten, but not their looks. I think that they must
have been unmarried daughters of Earls, for they are the kind of girls
which one meets most frequently. Lady M. received me with great kindness,

<!-- page 152 -->

and was very particular in her inquiries respecting a young relative of her's
living in New York, whom I have not the happiness of knowing. I found
that she was quite <i>au fait</i> in American literature, and much better acquainted
with some of our authors than I was. She is a subscriber to the Mirror, and
thinks that Mr. Willis still edits it. Her ladyship is very chatty and pleasing
in her manners, and resembles very nearly in her person, Mrs. Child, except
that she is older than that accomplished lady. During the evening Mr.
Wickoff came in. I was glad to see him because he was the most recent
importation from America that I had seen, excepting a grisly bear which
has just been added to the collection of the Zoological Society, in Regent's
Park.</p>

<p>Although Jerdan and Lockhart are both Scotchmen, and brother critics
by profession, they are not on good terms, and avoided each other the whole
evening. Mr. Bancroft and Lockhart were greatly taken with each other,
and talked some nonsense or other about history, all the time they were
there. Lady M. is a small woman, of most fascinating manners, and just
such a free impulsive talker, as you would imagine her to be from reading
her works. She has abandoned her pen entirely, which she can well afford
to do, after having used it so long and to so good a purpose.</p>

<p>There was a person at Lady M.'s, who was introduced to me as a gentleman
of the press, gentlemen at his profession not requiring any particular
name in London society. I have frequently met such persons at dinners
and <i>soirees</i>, and have never heard them spoken of in any other manner. It
is a very convenient plan, which might be still further carried out, a
'gentleman of the bar' a 'mercantile gentleman,' &amp;c., &amp;c., only other professions
are not yet sufficiently elevated to enable their members to pass current
without some other evidence of their worth than their calling affords. This
gentleman of the press had just returned from Arundel Castle, where he
had been to make notes on the doings of the Royal party. He assured me
that he knew, of his own personal knowledge, that the Countess of Beggartown
changed her dress forty-two times in three days, and that the Duke
of Starveborough wore lace night-caps, which cost &pound;3 l0s. 4d. each. The
Queen, you know, makes visits to the castles of the nobility, who show her
all their plate, cut glass, &amp;c. At Arundel Castle, among other curiosities, the
Duke engaged the Ethiopian Minstrels to amuse her Majesty, who was
graciously pleased by their banjo playing. On her return to town, happening
to hear that the Irish were in great want of food, she and Prince Albert
generously sent them &pound;2,500, which they could but ill afford from their
limited incomes; and considering the great number of poor relations they
have to take care of in Germany, I think they were very generous.</p>

<p>DEAR F.&mdash;The whole of May fair was yesterday thrown into a state of
the most profound grief. Every house in Park Lane has a mourner in it. Calling
at the Dutchess of C.'s yesterday morning, I was refused admittance to her
Grace, and hearing sobs from the <i>boudoir</i>, I supposed that some member of
that illustrious family had suddenly died. But such was not the fact; from C&mdash;&mdash;
House I hurried to Gore House, the residence of my friend the Countess of
Blessington. Here too, to my great amazement, I found the head of the House
in tears, with her ladyship's maid having a supply of dry handkerchiefs on a
silver salver which, I observed, was ornamented by some beautiful chasing,
evidently the work of that great genius Count D'Orsay. As I entered her
ladyship's drawing-room she motioned me to a divan, and raising her hands
exclaimed. 'O! Mr. Pinto!&mdash;'</p>

<p>You know it is a principle in the best circles of English society never
to show any emotion, whatever may be your feelings, (at least I learned as

<!-- page 124 -->

much from reading the letter of your former partner in business, Mr. Willis,
although I must  that I have never observed any thing of the
kind myself,) so I merely said in a careless manner, 'Ah, indeed.' But I was
almost dead with curiosity to know what had occasioned such universal grief
among the aristocracy. Has the cholera broken out among the lapdogs, thought
I, or what can it be. At last the cause flashed upon my mind. The Countess
is an Irishwoman, as you know, and the daughter of a not very exalted father.
Of course her ladyship was weeping over the distresses of her starving
countrymen. And as for the Dutchess of C., nothing could be more rational
than her grief, for her estates lie chiefly in the North of Scotland, where
the famine is dreadful, and the prospects of collecting rent for the next year
are very gloomy. No wonder that May fair was in mourning when the incomes
of the nobility are in such imminent danger of suspension, to say nothing of the
awful drains upon the purses of the rich by Government, to promote drainage
in Ireland. I could sympathize with the distressed nobility, for I know of
nothing that touches one's feelings more severely than touching one's income.</p>

<p>And the countess looked very amiable to me as she sat weeping over the
calamities of her native Isle. I had arranged a very pretty compliment to her
ladyship in my mind, comparing her to the Genius of Ireland, lamenting the
distresses of her children, which I began to prepare the way for bringing
out.</p>

<p>'Ah! Countess.' said I, taking my handkerchief slowly from my pocket and
unfolding it carefully, lest I should discover too much emotion for the high
toned manners of Gore House. 'It <i>is</i> dreadful.'</p>

<p>The Countess again said 'Oh, Mr. Pinto!' and took a dry handkerchief from
her waiting woman.</p>

<p>'Poor creatures!' said I.</p>

<p>'Poor craytur&mdash;' said he ladyship, who has not got rid entirely of her
native brogue.</p>

<p>'What will become of them if the next crop should fail!' said I.</p>

<p>'The next what, Mr. Pinto?' said her ladyship.</p>

<p>'The next crop,' I replied, more distinctly.</p>

<p>'Crop!' said she, 'crop of what?'</p>

<p>'Crop of potatoes, of course,' said I.</p>

<p>'Potatoes!' shrieked her ladyship, 'what <i>do</i> you mean, Mr. Pinto, by naming
such things in my hearing!'</p>

<p>'Was not your ladyship lamenting over the distresses of your countrymen?'
said I.</p>

<p>'My countrymen!' said she, indignantly, 'no, it was your countryman
Mr. Pinto, that darling little Tom Thumb, who has gone back to America,
and we never shall see him again, never!'</p>

<p>Finding myself in rather an awkward position from the strange blunder
I had made in thinking that the aristocracy cared enough about the starving
Irish to shed a tear for them, I hastily bade the Countess good morning, and
drove to the house of a friend in Bloomsbury whose family had no connexion

<!-- page 125 -->

with the nobility. But judge of my astonishment on entering this plebeian
mansion to find the mother and her two daughters with their handkerchiefs
to their eyes. However, I happily knew the cause of their grief, and could
seem to sympathize with them, for the middle classes love to copy after
the higher. So says I, 'The loss of that interesting little fellow is really
dreadful, ladies.'</p>

<p>'Isn't it dreadful?' said Mrs. Crimples, 'just as we were looking forward
to fifteen months more of pleasure with him.'</p>

<p>'Just as we had become so attached to his dear little old fashioned ways,'
said the Misses Crimples.</p>

<p>'Oh. I dare say he will come back again one of these days,' said I, for I
thought they were piling up the agony a little too high, considering the
smallness of the subject.</p>

<p>'Come back again!' exclaimed Miss Mary Ann Crimples, looking me in
the face, 'come back again, Mr. Pinto, what <i>do</i> you mean?'</p>

<p>'Why,' said I, 'Mr. Barnum is one of our most enterprizing citizens; and
as he has made a good deal of money by his first visit, of course he will
bring the little fellow back again.'</p>

<p>'What <i>are</i> you talking about?' exclaimed Mrs. Crimples 'how can the dear
child be brought back again when he is dead?</p>

<p>'Dead!' I exclaimed in astonishment, 'is my celebrated countryman General
Tom Thumb deceased!'</p>

<p>'Tom Thumb!' exclaimed the daughters simultaneously, 'it is dear little
Paul Dombey that is dead, Mr. Pinto.'</p>

<p>Sure enough, Young Dombey in dead, and the news of his death and the
departure at Tom Thumb both occurring on the same day, have thrown all
London into tears. The death of little Paul is a mystery to every body except
the initiated. Dickens says that he put an end to the boy's life to spite the
Americans, who were writing to him by every steamer, begging him not
to kill the child too early, as he had done by little Nell.</p>

<p><i>My dear F</i>.&mdash;You see that I am still in town, notwithstanding my hatred
of bricks and mortar, and my love of green hedges and cottages. But this
is the top of the London season, and as everybody is in town, and I have
lodgings in sight of the Green Park, I make out to exist. As I got through
the winter months without hanging myself, I may hope to pass the ordeal
of an entire season in London. But I am not so badly situated as you may
imagine; the Countess of Ellsmere sends me a bunch of violets from her
conservatory, every morning, and a rosy-cheeked girl from Somer's Town,
who keeps a short-horned cow under the shadow of the brazen Achilles,
in Hyde Park, brings me at 10 o'clock a cup of warm milk. And I have
been twice to Edmonton, with a party of literary friends, to see the room
in which your countrywoman and namesake Miss F. danced a Yankee jig.
The good people of the little inn, who had never in their lives seen one of
the literati before, tell the most marvellous stories of her performances.
Blaskett, the inn-keeper, when he heard the object of our visit, was as
voluble as a parrot, and told us a good many things about the strange party
that visited his house and insisted on dancing in honor of John Gilpin.
He thought at first they were a party of lunatics, and had arranged a plan
for putting straight-jackets upon them, but finding that they had money
to spend, concluded to make all the profit out of them he could. In his
ardor to oblige us, he made his wife get into the floor, and dance like
Miss F. If there was any resemblance in her breakdown, I do not wonder
that Blaskett thought he had been visited by a party of Bedlamites.</p>

<p>I went yesterday morning to breakfast with Mr. Rogers, the Banker-poet.
I had been often invited; but as these breakfasts are growing very common,
I had always declined going. But I thought it would be well enough to
go once, merely to have it to say that I had been there, just as one goes
to Court or to the top of St. Paul's. As it happened, I am glad that I went,
for I saw a number of notorieties, whom I could not have seen elsewhere.
Mr. Rogers is now a very old man&mdash;some say that he was one of the pages
at the coronation of George the Third, but the truth is, he was eighty-seven
on the l8th of last month, as I learned by inspecting the register of the
parish church of St. Pancras, in which he was christened. Such is his
passion for breakfasting the literati, that he has bequeathed a large part
of his fortune to be devoted to this purpose.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock when I arrived at his house, and soon after we were
summoned to the breakfast-room. There were ten or twelve guests, and
the only ladies present were the Hon. Mrs. Norton and Miss Rogers a
venerable young lady verging upon four score years. She sat at the head
of the table, and poured out the tea. The breakfast was a substantial meal&mdash;consisting
of tea and chocolate, toast, omelettes, Yarmouth bloaters and

<!-- page 154 -->

mutton chops a 'la Maintenon, with green peas. I suppose I ate a guinea's
worth of the vegetables. There were also some new potatoes raised in a
hot bed, which must have cost about five shillings each. Of these I devoured
four. They were rather waxy. Besides the tea and chocolate, there was some
capital ale on the table, and after the cloth was removed, some excellent
port was produced, which was the only wine I saw. But people don't go
to Mr. Rogers' to gormandize and guzzle. The company furnish the real
refreshment at his breakfasts. The part which he contributes from his menage
is the smallest item in the entertainment. Among the guests were the Duke
of Wellington, Peel, and Bishop Whately. The merely literary characters,
such as D'Israeli, Bulwer, Horne, and that dandy Tupper, I didn't take
much notice of. They pretended to be very much interested in my conversation,
because they wanted to be mentioned in my letters, which everybody
reads here, but I confined my conversation chiefly to Wellington and
Peel, who were very anxious to hear about America.</p>

<p>The Duke talked about Gen. Taylor, and said he was a good fellow, and
wanted to know if it was true that the President intended to recall him,
and give his command to a lawyer. I told him such was the case. 'Well,
Cottenham,' said his grace, turning to the Lord Chancellor, 'what would you
think, if her Majesty should appoint you a field marshall, and send you to
India to command old Gough?' 'Think?' said the Chancellor, 'why, that
she was a d&mdash;&mdash;.' But what he meant to say I can't tell, for the Bishop,
who sat near him, clapped his hand upon the Chancellor's mouth, and
smothered the words, whatever they were. Judging from his looks, I might
guess that the first and last letters of one word was a pair of d's, and of
the other an <i>f</i> and an <i>l</i>. Peel winked at me and laughed, and said I thought
the same thing of his majesty King Polk. But I looked very serious, and
said that the people in the United States never spoke disrespectfully of their
Executive. Peel then begged my pardon, and said he meant no offence.
He asked me what would be the probable amount of the next crop of
corn in the States. I replied that with the aid of Hunt's Magazine, I estimated
it at 314,837,240 bushels and 3 pecks, which he put down in his note
book, and said the estimate would be of great service to him. He then said,
'By the by, Mr. Pinto, is this Mr. Hunt you spoke of the editor who has
such luminous eyes?' Bulwer, who had been watching his opportunity to
say a word, now remarked that he had just received a copy of the Literary
World from New York, and was happy to see from the booksellers' advertisements,
as well as by the editorial matter, that the Americans still gave the
preference to English books. 'That was an excellent idea,' said he, 'of
establishing a review of your own, to review our books after they have
been noticed in the forty or fifty literary journals of this country. Because
your critic will have the benefit of all the opinions that have been expressed
abroad before he ventures to give his own, if he should happen to have
any. I suppose that your critic, instead of reading the book which he

<!-- page 155 -->

criticises, just takes and reads some half a dozen or more reviews of it in
our journals, and then makes a review out of them.'</p>

<p>I replied indignantly that my literary countrymen were entirely independent
of foreign criticism, and that they put no value whatever on
English reviews in particular. To which he replied 'Walker!' evidently being
very much disconcerted, and not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norton, who had been an attentive listener, said, 'And your name
is Pinto?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said I.</p>

<p>'I thought so,' she replied; but why she thought so I am sure I cannot tell.</p>

<p>Bishop Whately hearing me say something about New York, asked me if
I knew anybody there. I told him that I didn't know anybody anywhere
else. He remarked that he had read in the Mirror the advertisement of Mr.
Kernot, whom he had known in London, and wished to know if he kept
the up-town book store still. I had never known the gentleman he spoke of,
but I knew that his book store was frequented by the literati, and that he
was so celebrated for his knowledge of books and obliging ways, as to be
familiarly called one of the amenities of literature. The Bishop seemed gratified
to hear it, and said,&mdash;'Kernot was always a good fellow.'</p>

Rue Vivienne, No. 29</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;You see by the date of my letter that I am in Paris, and
I suppose, that you will wonder at my leaving my Noble friends in London,
who made so much of me. But, the truth is, England is no longer a proper
place for an American to live in who wishes to preserve his self respect.
I have left it forever, and while I remain in Europe shall reside in France,
where they have not yet been guilty of insulting my country by abolishing
the "peculiar Institution," which, you know, is regarded as the foundation
or our Liberty. There has been a "negro imposter," in London,&mdash;I don't
mean any of the sham darkies who sing Virginia melodies, but a real black
man, named Douglas, who pretends to be a philanthropist and an orator.
But, of course, he is neither, for things would come to a pretty pass if
black fellows were allowed to pass themselves off for philanthropists. This
fellow has been in the habit of calling large meetings of respectable white
people together, and telling them the most absurd stories about my countrymen,
and pretending that he had been nothing but a chattel, and these
people, who don't seem to know the difference between a darkey and a
free citizen of our country, go on in the most absurd manner about him,
and pretend to believe all he says. As I have a real regard for the colored
race, and have done all I could to have the freed negroes shipped off to
the coast of Africa, where I am sure they all ought to go, because they
might be instrumental in converting their brethren to christianity, for it is
well known that they make excellent missionaries, from the fact that their
desire to study the scriptures is so strong, that it has been found necessary
to pass laws forbidding anybody teaching them to read, lest they should
spend all their time in poring over polemical writings;&mdash;as I have a real
regard for them, which is more than any of these fanatics can say, I called
upon this fellow when I heard that he was delivering lectures about the
land of his birth, and said to him:</p>

<p>"I tell you how it is old fellow, I have heard of your slanders about the
glorious institutions of my country, and I will advise you for the future,
to keep dark."</p>

<p>"I shall," said he.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "if you do, I will speak a good word for you to some
of my friends, and I may get you a good place as a <i>valet</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I shall keep dark, for so God has chosen to make me.
And I bless his holy Name, that though he has given me dark skin, he
has not withheld light from my mind; and I bless Him and praise Him that
he has not given me a darkened mind and a white skin."</p>

<p>Such insolence as this, of course I could not put up with, so I was going
to chastise him with my cane, when he had the audacity to take hold of
my arm and threaten to put me out of the room if I raised my hand to him.

<!-- page 128 -->

As this happened at the London Tavern, in the presence of several people&mdash;(I
will not say gentlemen and ladies, for they cannot lay any claim to the
character of such, after refusing to assist me in punishing the fellow) whom
I know, I immediately left with feelings of the strongest disgust, and afterwards
finding that the fellow was countenanced, I entered a protest at
the Home Office against the insult put upon my country, demanded my
passports and left directly for Paris. The truth is, the English have no idea
about true liberty. The manner in which they tolerate blacks is really
distressing to an enlightened mind; and their pretended philanthropy in
freeing their slaves, is well understood by men of the world. When I embarked
at Dover, I shook the dust from my feet, or, to speak more correctly,
I scraped the chalk from my boots.</p>

<p>Paris is quite delightful. There is one drawback, here, however. The most
fashionable place of public amusement is the Theatre de Montpensier, which
was built by Alexandre Dumas, and as that noted person has African blood
in his veins, of course I cannot patronize it, and I am debarred from visiting
a place which all the world is rushing to. But I shall remain true to my
principles, for I think that every man is bound to sacrifice his personal
convenience to the honor of his country, as Captain Slidell Mackenzie said,
when he hung a midshipman and two sailors on board the Somers without
the ceremony of a trial.</p>

<p>I shall take a look at the affairs of Europe, now that I am on the spot,
and give your readers an exact account of their true position. The present
King of France, whose title is Louis Phillippe the First, King of the French,
was placed on the throne by the celebrated revolution of July, not the 4th,
and is immensely rich. His eldest son, the Duke of Orleans, was killed a
few months ago by being thrown from his carriage, and it is quite uncertain
who will be the next monarch. If nothing should happen it is probable that
the successor of Louis Phillippe will be his grandson, the young Count of
Paris; but if there should be an <i>eumete</i> it is probable that some other person
will be chosen. This I had from M. Guizot's own lips. I have been to several
<i>soirees</i> at the hotel of Thiers, who was very inquisitive about America, and
said if he had known that Mr. Headley was writing a history of Napoleon
and his Marshals that he would not have gone on with the history of the
Consulate and the Empire. I have been to the Louvre to see the old masters,
but they are all humbugs, and I don't think much about them. Science,
politics, the fine arts, religion, literature, philosophy and social life are
all in a state of transition. I will write my opinion on those subjects in my
next letter. Everybody knows me here, I find, by reputation; they go to
Caliguani's on purpose to read my letters in the Mirror. I had not been
in Paris twenty-four hours before I had calls from nearly twenty of the
most distinguished savans, philosophers, artists, poets and actors. Among
those who left their cards were Paul de Kock, Jules Jasin, George Sand,
Paul de la Roche, Edgar Quinet, Lamartine, Victor de Lamney, and Rachel.
But the rascals all spell my name wrong. Some directed their cards to

M. Pintot, some to Signor Pinteaux, some to Pinteux, and some to Mons. F.
Pintot. But none to the name which I shall ever be proud to sign, as truly yours,</p>

<p class="right">F. M. PINTO.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Unfortunately I arrived here just too late to see that exceedingly
agreeable editrice Miss F., who has left a trail of light behind her as she
has run through Europe. But I have luckily fallen upon several lively Frenchmen
who had the good fortune to meet Miss F. when she was here and from
them I have heard several interesting stories which you will be happy to hear.</p>

<p>[<i>New York Daily Mirror</i>&mdash;June 21, 1847.]</p>

<p>ANOTHER LETTER FROM MR. PINTO.&mdash;Our readers will be greatly relieved
to hear that we have again a prospect of having frequent letters from our
most popular and highly esteemed travelling correspondent, Mr. Pinto. It
will be seen by the following letter that he was in Paris at the time of the
steamer's sailing, where we fear he has been indulging too much in the
gaieties of that capitol. We once had the misfortune to employ a gentleman
to write letters from Europe, who set a higher value upon his labors than
anybody else, and was more anxious to keep his performances than his
promises, for having taken our money, he forgot that he had agreed to
return an equivalent for it. But Mr. Pinto's honor is as unquestionable
as his veracity, and our readers may be sure that he will redeem his promises
to us and them.</p>

<p class="right">PARIS, June 1, 1847</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.,</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;Since this occurrence (<i>we omit a few lines which relates to a private
matter of no interest to the public</i>) I have met with no disagreeable people
in Paris. The truth is, that rich countrymen who come here seem to think
that there is no other pleasure to be found in Paris than that of spending
money; and the T&mdash;&mdash; family having set the fashion in that respect, the
Parisians turn the cold shoulder to you unless you shell out like a prince.
But that is not exactly a just simile, for all the princes that I have met
here have been meaner than Connecticut clock pedlers. On Friday night
last I supped with the Prince de Witzsnesky, at the Hotel de Chaney&mdash;there
were two beautiful <i>lorettes</i> on the sideboard, apparently of solid gold,
which the Prince offered to sell. I agreed to buy them at a certain price,
and when they were sent to my room in the Faubourg St. Germain the
next day, I discovered that I had been cheated, the gold lorettes proving
to be nothing but gilded copper. I had paid my money for them, however,
and had to pocket the loss. I mentioned the circumstance to the Count
de &mdash;&mdash;, and observed that I should send the Prince a challenge, but
he said,&mdash;"Pooh! pooh! I will put you in a way of getting back your money.
The king is very fond of patronising American artists. Send the <i>lorettes</i>

<!-- page 130 -->

to him with your card, and say that they were made by yourself in the
backwoods of your native State, wherever that may be, and the king will
reward your ingenuity by sending you a check on his private banker for
a hundred thousand francs at least." I flared up at this base suggestion,
of course, and ordered the Count out of my apartments. I would not have
mentioned this circumstance but that I have been informed of the Count's
having been sent to New York by the last packet, by the association which
exists here for obtaining the fortunes of American heiresses. The Count is
furnished with an outfit at the expense of the association, he being as poor
as an author, and one-half of the fortune he may obtain by marrying a rich
girl must be paid to the association. The diamond rings, watch, gold headed
cane, shirt studs, and eye glass which he wears, have already done good
service in New York, and when the Count returns the <i>bijouterie</i> will be
given up to the association, to be used by another of their members. The
Secretary of the society informed me that they had recently declared a good
dividend out of the proceeds of a fortune which one of the associates had
married in Philadelphia. I was very curious to know who the lady was
that had been caught, but the members all being sworn to secrecy, I could
only learn that she was the only daughter of a rich druggist.</p>

<p>This society once drove a very profitable business in London, but they
have of late years confined their operations entirely to the United States,
where titles and distinguished foreigners are held in greater esteem than in
any other part of the world. The members of the association have to pay
a small entrance fee, and produce a certificate of their nobility, unless
they are very good looking, in which case the association furnishes the title
of Count and the jewelry. The members are required to know how to read
and write&mdash;to waltz, to play on some musical instrument, and to have
good teeth. These things are indispensable in all, and then candidates for
admission undergo an examination by a committee, and receive instructions
from some of the older members who have returned from a successful
mission. There has been a rival association formed in Vienna for sending
German barons and <i>savans</i> over to America, and there has been great jealousy
between the two; but the brotherhood of French Counts has thus far been
the most successful. The secretary of the latter association says that they
never keep more than three members in America at a time, allowing one
to each of the three principal cities. At the outset they made some shocking
mistakes&mdash;three or four of their associates having married the daughters
of merchants who afterwards failed, and they had to be taken care of by
the association. Great pains have to be taken to make the young members
fall in love before they leave Paris, so that they may not fall into such a
silly mistake after they arrive in New York or Boston. This surprised me
a great deal, and I said "Pray, Monsieur &mdash;&mdash;, how do you expect these
young rascals are going to get married unless they first fall in love with
somebody?"</p>

<p>The secretary gave me a contemptuous look and uttered the universal

<!-- page 131 -->

"<i>Peste!</i>" which expresses everything that is contemptuous and vexatious with
a Frenchman.</p>

<p>As the Count de &mdash;&mdash; is probably in New York by this time, I will
give you a brief sketch of his person that you may know him when you
see him. He is about 35 years of age, tall, fair-complexioned, with regular
features, a beautifully chiseled mouth and chin, dark chestnut-colored
moustache, good teeth, and perfectly good eyes; although he wears an
eye-glass. He plays on the guitar and sings Italian. The brotherhood, who
keep a register of all the marriageable fortunes in the three American
cities, have formed great expectations of his success, and even went to
the unusual expense of allowing him an extra outfit of a dozen of fine
cotton shirts. He had particular instructions when he left from the executive
committee to make his <i>coup d'essai</i> upon one of the three daughters of a
wealthy tailor whose death in Philadelphia had just been heard of. It is
supposed that if he should be successful in that family, the other sisters
might be brought over to Paris and taken by some of the members of the
association here, which would save the expense of two outfits. The secretary
informed me of a very curious fact in psychology. He says that the families
of Tailors have a stronger <i>penchant</i> for Counts than any other class of
Americans, and that some of the best speculations of the association have
been among those people.</p>

<p>I have been paying a good deal of attention to the affairs of Europe
lately, and shall give you my opinions in relation to the probable duration
of the monarchal principles of government in my next.</p>

<p>I dined with Mons. Thiers yesterday, where I had the pleasure of meeting
that remarkable author, Geo. Sand. He is quite young for so famous an
author, and I understand intends visiting the United States in one of the
French steamers. George Sand, altho a Frenchman born, is of English
descent. His ancestor came over in the train of Henry the Eighth, and was
one of the knights who accompanied that monarch to the field of the cloth
of gold. He showed me a piece of the cloth itself, about the size of a
pocket handkerchief, which has been preserved in his family as an heirloom.
Sand is a very gay, dashing young fellow; he writes his novels between
the hours of eleven and two at night, and is remarkable for the great
number of diamond rings which he wears.</p>

<p>I am not in the habit of making puns, but I made a shocking one in
regard to Mons. Sand, which has caused a good deal of merriment here;
and I was told by M. Guizot, was laughed at by Louis Phillippe.  Sand, as
I said, is a very gay young fellow, and is almost proverbial for his cheerfulness,
which nothing can affect. Leaving him in a warm debate with
Mons. Thiers, on the subject of polygamy, which it is well known he favors,
I came out into the Boulevard Janlieus and there I met my friend Vicompte
de Lamnay, who was sauntering along with an opera-dancer at his side.</p>

<p>"Aha, Pinto," said he, "when did you see Sand?"</p>

<!-- page 132 -->

<p class="right">ROME, August 25, 1847</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;After parting that night with Guizot, and being satisfied
that it would be quite impossible for the government of Louis Phillippe
to do justice to our glorious institutions by withholding the royal sanction
from Dumas, I resolved to leave Paris <i>sur le champ</i>, as the ladies say in
their letters. The next day I received my passports from the minister and
left Paris. But before I came away I sent an indignant remonstrance to
the <i>Debats</i> against the slight put upon my country by the toleration of
such a person as&mdash;(<i>the MS is so imperfect that we cannot make out the
name</i>,) but the editor had not the courage to print it. That withering rebuke
would have caused many a tremor in the Tuilleries. But the truth is,
<i>la belle France</i>, as they absurdly call that shockingly disagreeable place,
knows nothing about liberty or true democratic principles. You may judge
what pretensions it can have to the title of <i>la belle</i> when I tell you that
the manager of one of their theatres is a quadroon, and that they allow
black students in their college. Pah! I hurried out of the kingdom as fast
as I could, and came here where I understood there were several American
<i>editrices</i>. The Pope, you know, is a capital good fellow and a real republican;
my friend, the Abbe Lamennais, gave me a letter of introduction to his
Holiness, which insured me a good reception, an invitation to dinner in
the Vatican. You have heard talk, I suppose, about kissing the Pope's
toe; I had read something about it myself, and I told Lamennais that of
course it couldn't be expected that a man brought up under the influence
of our glorious institutions should debase himself by stooping quite so low
as to kiss the toe of even so great a man as the Pope, and that I, for one,
intended to enter an indignant remonstrance against it. He said that I had
better stay away from Rome unless I intended to do as Romans do, and
I must confess that the old apothegm never before struck me with such
force. However, I was determined not to stay away, for I wanted to see
the Pope and the other curiosities of that celebrated city. Accordingly I left
Paris and came here by the usual route, and besides having my pockets
picked by everybody on the way, I was stopped and robbed in the Appenines
by a splendid-looking Italian bandit who looked as though he had just
walked out of a melodrama. After he had obtained my purse, I asked him
if he would have the goodness to allow me to look at his blunderbuss; he

<!-- page 133 -->

did so, what I immediately levelled it at him and bade him deliver; he
attempted to run, but I fired and he fell. Perceiving that he was dead,
I hurriedly rifled his pockets, not only of the money of which he had
robbed me, but seeing a splendid ring on his finger, I took it off and
found it was marked Mrs. J. G. B. I afterwards learned that he had taken
it from a celebrated <i>editrice</i>, one of my own countrywomen, who was
creating a great sensation among the Cardinals, owing to her having so
many friends among those amiable people the Austrians. I shall have the
pleasure of delivering it to her when I return. I had not proceeded many
steps from where the bandit fell, before he rose and began to curse me
in "very choice Italian." It appeared that he had only been stunned, which
I was glad to perceive, for it would have given me great uneasiness to have
killed such a splendid-looking fellow, for what would Italy be without its
handsome robbers and old pictures.</p>

<p>On my arrival in the city, I immediately called upon Cardinal Gizzi,
who took me to the Vatican in his carriage, and introduced me to the Pope.
I reached out my hand to shake hands with his Holiness when the Cardinal
whispered to me that the Pope never shook hands with anybody, and that
I must kiss his toe. Kneel down, my son, said his Holiness, it will do you
no harm. I replied that I was not under any apprehensions that it would,
but that it might possibly do him some harm, for if I got my mouth near
his toe, I should be certain to bite it, as I had a strange propensity that
way. The Cardinal then whispered to Pius, who said that as I was an
American citizen, and one of the Anglo Saxons, of whose victories in Mexico
he had heard, I should be excused from the usual ceremony of kissing his
toe, and to show what a good democrat he was, he reached out his hand
and gave me a hearty shake. He invited me to dine with him the next day,
and said that he supposed I would like to look at his collection of pictures,
as all the Americans who came to Rome were great admirers of the Fine
Arts. I quite surprised him by telling him that in my own green forest home
in the West, we too had painters; I told him that we had produced a
Whitehorn, a Shegogue and a West; and that we could boast of a Century
Club and a National Gallery. He was a good deal surprised to hear these
famous names, and said that he hoped to see me often at the Vatican, as
he wished to have some conversation with me about the institutions of
America. Cardinal Gizzi then intimated to me that it was time to withdraw.
as there were several princes waiting to be introduced. The particulars of
the dinner at the papal residence, and the curious conversation I had with
his holiness about religion and other matters I shall give you in my next
letter. After we left, Cardinal Gizzi took me in a red-wheeled carriage to
a good many places I wished to see, among the rest to Frascati's, and
then we drove to Mount Algidus to enjoy a real Italian sunset, where I
saw several poor devils of Artists trying to paint the glorious scene, but
they did not succeed very well.</p>

<p class="center">Another Letter From Mr. Pinto</p>

<p>We are happy to present the following interesting letter to our readers,
which we received by the last arrival from our highly valued correspondent.
It will serve as an answer to the many anxious enquiries that have been
addressed us from different parts of the country, respecting Mr. Pinto's
present whereabout. He is still in Italy, where he upholds the honor of
his country under all circumstances with the same noble feeling of patriotism,
which he has displayed since he went abroad.&mdash;Ed. Mir.</p>

<p class="right">ROME, Oct. 1, 1847</p>

<p>MY DEAR F.&mdash;A former correspondent of the Mirror gave you his first
impression of Rome, and a pretty good description of some of the ruins,
which are to be seen here, but I shall not take the trouble to do any thing
of the sort; I send you a half dozen volumes in which you will find
everything set down that is worth knowing respecting the decayed part
of the eternal city; and if you should think your readers are in want of
any information on such subjects, you can occasionally give them a page
or two of authentic details. As to the present population of Rome, I think
that New Yorkers must be tolerably familiar with their personal appearance,
for every American Artist that comes here sends home a dozen or two of
portraits of the beggars in the character of Apostles, or Virgin Maries. A
sturdy old fellow who blacks my boots tells me that he has been painted
twenty eight times in the character of Saint Paul, thirteen times as Joseph, nine
times as Saint Peter, he cannot remember how many times as the "Roman
Father," and as "the Head of an Old Man," at least a thousand times. One
would think that from assuming these pious characters so often, he would have
attained to uncommon sanctity, but he is, in truth, the greatest rogue I have
seen in Italy. When I accused him of his rogueries and told him what a
scandal it was that a man who personated so many saints should be so little
like them, he had the impudence to say to me: "why not, Signor? How can I
afford to be honest when I only get ten cents an hour for sitting as a saint.
If I got as good pay as the Padres do for acting the saint, I could afford to
be as good as they are, and that would be nothing to boast of Signor. I think
I am a very good saint for the pay."</p>

<p>The rascal prides himself a good deal on being sent so often to America,
and the other day he told me that he believed there was not a gentleman's
parlor in my country in which he or one of his family was not hung up in a
gilt frame. He said to me yesterday, "my son and daughter have just been
sent to America again, one as '<i>a Peasant Boy of the Campagna</i>,' and the

<!-- page 135 -->

other as '<i>a Roman Lady</i>.' " Having detected him that week in an attempt to
secrete one of my pocket handkerchiefs, to show his contrition, he said he
and his daughter (who is quite as great a thief as her father,) would sit to
one of my artist-countrymen, for a holy family, if I would promise not to
expose him. "A precious pair you are to-be-sure for a Holy family," said I.
"Why, Signor," said the rogue, "my religious expression is worth two cents an
hour more than that of any man in Rome; and as for my daughter she is
a most excellent Virgin, and if her little boy had not had his face marked
with that rascally small-pox, she would have commanded two scudi an
hour more than any jade in all Italy."</p>

<p>But such trifles as these are hardly worth sending all the way from
Rome to New York. You will be better pleased to learn something about
the Pope, who is the only object now in Rome worth a moment's consideration.
I have already informed you that his Holiness had invited me to dine
with him at the Vatican; the day on which I was to realize this great honor
happened to be the festival of Saint Onofrio, the Egyptian; and as there was
to be some public rejoicings in the evening, it was necessary that the Pope
should be free from any engagements before the illuminations commenced,
because he was to bless the candles; therefore I was instructed to be in
readiness at an early hour in the afternoon. It was just half past two when
the scarlet-wheeled carriage of Cardinal Gizzi stopped at my palazza; the
Cardinal had gone to the Vatican some hours before, he having some private
business to transact with the Pope; so I had to ride alone to the papal
residence&mdash;and I must acknowledge that I felt somewhat flurried at the
thought of dining with such a host&mdash;and the thought occurred to me, as I
am prone to make mal-apropos speeches, that, if there should happen to
be a roast goose on the table, I should infallibly ask for the Pope's nose; and
then a far more disagreeable thought occurred to me. The chances were ten
to one that I should be poisoned, for I knew that the Austrians, the Neapolitan
minister, the representative of the Duke of Lucca, and the ambassador
from the King of Sardinia, had all threatened to take the life of the Pope,
and that there had been repeated attempts to poison his food. I might have
saved myself any fears on this score, for there was nothing on the dinner-table
but boiled eggs and a pitcher of clear water. I had to pass through
several long galleries in the Vatican, which were lined with Swiss soldiers,
before I reached the private apartments of the Pontiff. I found him in a
small octagon saloon, which was furnished very simply and without any pictures,
although the walls were painted in fresco by Andrea del Sarto, the
subject being some rather equivocal story from the pagan mythology,
executed by order of Caesar Borgia when his father occupied the papal chair.
The only persons with his Holiness were the Cardinals Gizzi and Lambuschini.
The latter whispered in my ear when I entered, "Remember, when Pius
comes into his private rooms, he leaves his Holiness at the door." I understood
this as a hint not to address him by that dignified title; and not knowing
exactly what to say, I called him Mr. Pius; but I observed afterwards

<!-- page 136 -->

that the Cardinals called him Papa&mdash;so I corrected my mistake, and did the
same. He received me with great cordiality; and, soon after I entered, we
sat down to dinner. The plainness of the repast surprised me, for I had
anticipated some Roman punch at the very least. However, I did not forget
that I was in Rome, and of course I expected to do as Romans do. But when
Pius remarked that the dinner was a plain one, I could not help replying, "that
in my own country, I thanked Heaven, that under our glorious institutions,
freedom of speech and conscience were enjoyed by every member of the
community, and that there a man might be virtuously great, without being
in danger of eating poison with his food."</p>

<p>Pius looked a little surprised at this remark, and turning to Cardinal
Lambuschini he said, "my son, how shamefully I have been imposed upon by
travellers from America, who have told me stories about the Bostonians
setting fire to a convent of poor nuns, and destroying their property and
perilling their precious lives on account of their religious faith." The Cardinal
merely shrugged his shoulders and said, <i>non mi ricordo</i>: I fear out of politeness
to me; for I think he must have noticed the scarlet blushes in my face;
but as I have adopted for my motto that noble sentiment of my brave countryman,
"my country, may she always be right; but right or wrong, my
country." I wasn't going to acknowledge the guilt of the Bostonians, for the
truth is, I had an uncle engaged in that business of setting fire to that convent,
and I think he was not far from right either. Therefore I did not seem to
take any notice of this observation of the Pope, who, I began to see, was a
good deal of a humbug after all, and I thought I would let him know that I
could see about as far into a millstone as most people of my age, so I said
to him, "How does it happen, Pius, that you do not at once give entire
freedom to the people of your government and put them on a level with my
countrymen, who live under our glorious institutions. What is the good of
dilly-dallying with the poor devils, yielding a little to them to-day, a little
tomorrow, and so on? Make them free at once, and give them a constitution,
like ours."</p>

<p>"My son," he replied, "my will is good to do so, but policy forbids. My
people are not yet prepared for the degree of liberty which you ask for them.&mdash;They
must be prepared for it before it can be safely given to them."</p>

<p>"Prepared for it!" I exclaimed. "Why, did ever any rational being talk so
absurdly before. Prepare a man for freedom by keeping him in bondage! Well,
that is decidedly original. For my part, Pius, I think a man is prepared for
the enjoyment of freedom the moment that he has the capacity to desire it."</p>

<p>"And are you all so perfectly free in your country?" said he.</p>

<p>"As free as the air we breathe!" I replied, exultingly.</p>

<p>"How I have been imposed upon," said his Holiness, turning again to
Lambuschini, "they told me that you had three millions of slaves in the
United States."</p>

<p>"So we have," said I. And I repeated to myself those beautiful lines of
the Wizzard of the North,</p>

<!-- page 137 -->

<p class="small">Lives there a man with soul so dead<br/>

Who never to himself hath said,<br/>

This is my own, my native land.</p>

<p>"What, do they live under those glorious institutions you have apostrophized
so often?" said he.</p>

<p>"Of course they do," said I, proudly.</p>

<p>"Why do you not make them free," said his Holiness, winking to Cardinal
Gizzi. I noticed it and replied indignantly;</p>

<p>"Because they are a set of lazy, ignorant rascals, who wouldn't know
what to do with themselves if they were freed."</p>

<p>"O, ho!" said the Pope, "then of course they never show any desire for
freedom by running away from their masters, because if people are fit for
liberty when they have the capacity to desire it you would give it to them."</p>

<p>It was very evident what sort of people these Italians are, and I saw
exactly what the meaning of liberality is when applied to a Pope of Rome;
they have about as correct a notion of true liberty as they have of true
religion. I had no idea of hearing my country reviled by a Pope of Rome,
who has had his mind poisoned by English abolitionists; so I looked at
my watch, and remarking that I had an engagement to go and see the Coliseum
by moonlight with some countrywomen of mine who had come to Rome
for that purpose, I bade the Pope and his two Cardinals a haughty farewell,
determined never again to darken the doors of such a humbug. The next day I
received a note from Cardinal Lambuschini, which you shall know more
about in my next.</p>
