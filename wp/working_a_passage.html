<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE CAUSE WHY.</p>

</div>

<p>A NEW book is not so great a rarity in these days
as to require an apology for its appearance; but
when an author has a reasonable excuse to offer for
his work, it is better to give it than to put the reader
to the trouble of divining excuses for him. Besides,
I cannot but think, judging from my own
feelings, that the public will be more ready to listen
patiently to any one who challenges their attention,
when the challenger explains his motives for so doing
in the outset.</p>

<p>My motive, then, in writing and publishing this
little book, is to furnish a hint to those young men,
very numerous I fear they are, who sometimes find
themselves suddenly deprived of their accustomed
means of support, and before they become used to
standing alone, fall so heavily to the ground, as to
be unable ever to rise again. I can conceive nothing
more melancholy, than to see one human being
dependent upon another for support, when nature
has not deprived him of the lawful means of supporting
himself. In one sense, men are all dependent
upon each other; and therefore, whosoever receives
anything from his fellow creatures should return
an equivalent, or he is not worthy to remain
among them; he is a useless member in the arch
of society, a block that gives neither ornament nor
strength, and should therefore be removed.</p>

<p>No man should ever hesitate, either to ask, or receive
aid from others, who is conscious of a desire
to aid himself. In working for himself, he has worked

<!-- page 6 -->

for others. The most selfish people do a vast deal
of good to their neighbours without knowing it. The
farmer, who from motives of intense selfishness, tills
his ground so that it produces a double crop, lightens
the burden of his poorer neighbour, who is in
consequence enabled to buy cheaper bread. Society
has nothing to ask of its members, but that each
one should be intensely selfish and provide for his
own necessities.</p>

<p>Though an honest man should never blush to receive
aid, yet nothing can be more gratifying to such
an one, than the consciousness of having extricated
himself from pecuniary embarrassments by the sweat
of his own brow; while the most depressing condition
that an intelligent mind can be placed in, is
that of dependence upon friends, or of indebtedness
to any body. To have eaten the bread of honest
industry&mdash;the industry that causes the sweat to start
from the brow&mdash;is to have tasted, one of the greatest
enjoyments of life. How many miss it, who dream
of having skimmed the cream of human felicities!
Many rich men seek after this enjoyment by boisterous
amusements, and violent exercises in the
open air; but they mistake the negative pleasure of
repose after weariness, for the positive zest of enjoyment,
which is the sure reward of industry.
"Labour for labour's sake is against nature," says
Locke. They mistake fatigue of the body for the
refreshment of mind which only an honest purpose
can give to labour. A man may strengthen the
muscles of his arms by the use of dumb-bells, but
such exercise will enfeeble his mind, as much as
though he wasted his time in toying with a doll.</p>

<p>Many young men, both in town and country, have
disgracefully resorted to fraud and meanness to save
themselves from what they have falsely considered
the degradation of labour; and for so doing they
have not been so much open to blame as the instructors

<!-- page 7 -->

who instilled such pernicious ambition into
their minds. Society should be most lenient to the
vices which its own rules engender; but in an ill-organized
community, everything is distorted from
its right use, and punishments and rewards are
meted out to the greatest extent, where they are
least deserved. Our statute law makes no distinction
between the man who eats his bread by the
sweat of his own brow, and him who eats it by the
sweat of another's. Not so our common law&mdash;our
law of daily habit&mdash;which is read by all men, and
therefore most regarded. The soft hands and the
hard hands are distinct orders in our social constitution;
where all men are very far from being equal.
It was my lot to be reared among the former, and
to imbibe all their prejudices, and be swayed by all
the effeminate customs of the caste. For this I do
not blame those who had the direction of my education.
It would be impossible, by precept, to counteract
the effect which the practice of the world has
upon the minds of the young. The only true teaching
for youth is example.</p>

<p>Happily, I was compelled to learn a lesson in regard
to these things, before my mind had become so
hardened in the mould in which it was first formed,
as to be incapable of receiving other impressions.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">GETTING ADRIFT.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the beginning of July, l832, New-York was
thrown into a consternation by the appearance of
the Asiatic cholera, and all who had the means of
leaving the city, began to make arrangements for
their departure. Being an only son, I was a pet
with my mother, who urged my father to send me
away until the threatened pestilence should be
passed. For my father's occupations were of a nature
that compelled him to remain in the city, and
she refused to leave without him. But where should
I go? Since the terrible epidemic had made its
appearance upon the continent, it was impossible to
anticipate the points of its attack; and there seemed
as much danger in visiting any neighbouring city,
as in remaining at home. A place of safety immediately
suggested itself to my own mind,&mdash;Europe.
At first my father opposed it strongly. I was in my
twentieth year, and it had been arranged that I
should go into business with a fellow-clerk a few
years older than myself, when I reached my majority.
He was apprehensive that I should fall into
loose habits; the very sound of Europe seemed to
alarm him with vague notions of uncertain expenses.
He had an idea that one could not go to Europe
without associating with the nobility and kings and
emperors. But after making some inquiries among
the importers of his acquaintance, he became satisfied
that one might visit Europe without mixing
with such expensive company; and finding that

<!-- page 9 -->

travelling abroad would cost very little more than
travelling at home, he consented to my going.</p>

<p>My father's misapprehension about the kind of
company that I should fall into in Europe, was not
so much out of the way as some may think. He
was a very diligent reader of newspapers, but he
rarely read anything else; and as the health and
doings of princes and the nobility form the greater
portion of the European news dealt out to the public
by the morning and evening presses, these personages
naturally came first into his mind when
Europe was mentioned; just as one would think
of being introduced to the Grand Seignior, if he
should talk of going to Constantinople.</p>

<p>My mother was very anxious that I should visit
Europe, not only for my own improvement, but for
the credit of the family. None of our name had
gone back to the father-land since our ancestors
came over two hundred years before. It was the
2d of July when my going was determined upon,
and a packet, the Philadelphia, was to sail on the
10th for London; I engaged my passage immediately,
and devoted the intervening time to preparations
for my journey.  At first it was determined
that I should go no farther than Paris, and return as
soon as I heard of the disappearance of the cholera;
but as going to Europe was not likely to be an event of
very frequent occurrence in my life, I prevailed
upon my father to allow me to remain abroad a year,
for I had a very strong desire to visit Florence and
Rome. When the day of my departure arrived, I
was half inclined to remain, for the pestilence had
begun to spread to a very alarming extent, and I
took leave of my parents and sisters with a heavy
heart.</p>

<p>We had a tedious passage across the Atlantic, at
least it seemed tedious to me, for I had never been
at sea before and I suffered a good deal from sea-sickness.

<!-- page 10 -->

The ship was new and her accommodations
were excellent, but there was a woful difference
between the narrow state-room of a ship's
cabin, and the spacious chamber I had always occupied
at home. And then the table! capital for a
ship, no doubt; but I thought it a great hardship to
eat my dinner without fresh vegetables, and to drink
stale water; but worse than all, the uncertainty when
I took a cup of coffee or a spoonful of soup in my
hand, whether it would go down the inside or outside
of my throat. These things were the merest
trifles, scarcely worth a passing thought with an old
traveller, but I thought they were very serious matters,
and looked upon myself as quite a hero for
enduring them.</p>

<p>There were some forty or fifty men, women and
children, cooped up in a little hole between decks,
forward of the cabin, called the steerage, who slept
in hanging shelves eight or ten in a tier, and cooked
their own food, when the weather would admit of
a fire being kindled in the galley allotted to their
use, who doubtless looked upon the passengers in
the cabin as enjoying quite a Heaven afloat. But,
never having suffered any discomforts myself, I
could not feel for those who did, and therefore it
never occurred to me that I was enjoying privileges
which were denied to others, who were quite as
worthy as myself. I have since looked back with
amazement when I have thought of the apathy of
feeling with which I regarded delicate looking
women enduring hardships that I should have considered
unbearable in my own case, and wondered
that I could not perceive what a favoured creature
I was. But the fish do not know that there is such
an element as water, until they are drawn out of it.</p>

<p>The life of a passenger, whether in the cabin or
steerage, on board of a packet ship, can hardly be
called life; it is a state of half way existence between

<!-- page 11 -->

dreaming and waking, and, is not the kind of "life"
which I intend to describe in these pages. Eating
and sleeping are the only employments which a passenger
can attend to, and these are never enjoyed
with a zest, because they are indulged in too freely.
The only event which really appears like life on the
ocean, to a mere spectator, is a death. Death is
always so near, so solemn, so positive and thought-compelling,
that wherever he may come he forces us
to remember that we are living beings, and that we
have interests at stake beyond the little affairs which
surround us. I was made fully sensible of the truth
of these trite reflections before our passage was half
made. In the cabin there was a lively young gentleman,
who, like myself, had left New-York to avoid
the cholera. He had been at sea before, and was
almost the only passenger among us who did not
suffer from sea-sickness. One day after dinner he
stood by the fife-rail of the mainmast, smoking a
cigar and chatting with Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, when an
iron marlinespike fell from the hands of a sailor who
was at work at the head of the topmast, and struck
him on the crown of his head. The sharp end of
the marlinespike buried itself two or three inches in
his brain. He died, almost instantly, and was buried
the same evening. It was a calm, moonlight night,
the ship was hardly moving through the water, but
the main topsail was thrown aback according to
sea etiquette; the peak of the spanker was lowered,
the corpse, sewed up in a canvass shroud, with a
heavy weight attached to the feet, was placed upon
a plank with an end resting upon the taffrail. Our
captain read the services for the burial of the dead
at sea, while the crew and passengers gathered round
with uncovered heads; when the last amen was
pronounced, the plank was raised and the body of
our companion plunged into the ocean. I could not
see it, but looking over the taffrail immediately after,

<!-- page 12 -->

I saw a few bubbles rise and burst, which seemed
to say, this is life.</p>

<p>"Hard up your helm; wear round!" cried the
mate, and we were once more on our way.</p>

<p>We arrived at Spithead on the 6th day of August,
and I hurried ashore in the first boat that came off
from Portsmouth, quite as anxious to get something
comfortable to eat and drink, as to step upon English
soil. Some of the passengers remained on board the
ship until she reached London. But I got there a day
or two ahead of her, and when she hauled into
the St. Katharine's dock, I went on board of her
with some such feelings of curiosity as a released
prisoner may be supposed to experience in revisiting
the place of his confinement, after tasting the
sweets of freedom. Disagreeable as my recollections
of the ship were, a few days' acquaintance with
Mivart's, for an inconsiderate friend of my father's
had recommended me to lodge at that expensive
hotel, caused her to appear so very uncomfortable
in my eyes, that I only took one look at my old state-room,
with its narrow berth and blue morocco
curtains, and shuddering at the thought of being
compelled to squeeze myself into such contracted
quarters again, I leaped ashore, and blessed myself
that I was on dry land</p>

<p>I had determined to spend the summer and
autumn in England and Scotland, and not visit Paris
until November, when I expected to receive letters
from home, and a bill of credit on Hottinguer &amp; Co.,
which my father had promised to send me. I had
the good fortune to make some pleasant acquaintances
in Scotland, who detained me longer than I
intended remaining there, so that I did not reach
Paris until the middle of November, when my money
was nearly spent. I called upon Hottinguer &amp; Co.
the day after my arrival, and found letters that had
been lying there for more than a month. They

<!-- page 13 -->

contained no bill of credit, but they informed me of
my father's death. He was almost the last victim
of the cholera. In addition to this distressing news,
I was informed by a letter from the young gentleman
with whom I was to have formed a business
connection, that my father had died insolvent, but
that he would, on my return, complete the arrangements
for our partnership, without regard to the
deficiency of capital on my part, which he knew this
unhappy event would cause. I was touched by his
generosity, but it gave me the bitterest feelings I
had ever experienced in my life, to find myself considered
an object of compassion.</p>

<p>I had no friends in Paris; my money was nearly
gone, and the necessity of taking some immediate
steps towards home, would not allow me to give
way to the bitterness of my grief. I had not sufficient
money to pay for a passage from Havre to
New-York, and I could not think of asking credit,
with a probability of being unable to pay on my
arrival. In looking over a file of English papers at
Galignani's the day before, I had seen in Gore's
Advertiser, the ship Seneca advertised to sail in a
few days from Liverpool for New-York. This ship
belonged to the merchants in whose counting-room
I had served my time; I was well acquainted with
the master, and I determined to return to England
immediately, and go home in her; for I knew that
a passage would cost me nothing. I left Paris the
next morning, and arrived at Liverpool in three
days. But a new disappointment awaited me. The
Seneca had hauled out of dock, was still in sight,
and bound down the river. The wind and tide
were in her favour, and I found it would be impossible
to overtake her with a boat. I returned to
the Star and Garter Hotel in Castle-street, where I
had landed, in a most unhappy state of mind. The
expenses of coming from Paris had left me with a

<!-- page 14 -->

bare sovereign, but little more than enough to defray
another day's expenses at the hotel.</p>

<p>I had but little time for thought; the next packet
for New-York would not leave under a week, and
even though I should get credit for a passage, what
would support me in the mean time? I could sell
my watch. But it was a gift from my father; and
I could not endure the thought of parting with it.
I could go as a steerage passenger; but I had no
money to purchase provisions; and I remembered
how wretchedly the steerage passengers had seemed
to live on board the Philadelphia, how they were
abused by the mate, and jeered by the sailors; my
soul revolted at the thought of herding with such
people. By appealing to some of the American
ship-masters in the port, I could doubtless have borrowed
the money; but as I had no prospect of repaying
it when I got home, I could not entertain
such an idea. It was humiliating enough to return
to my mother penniless; I would not go to her in
debt. Could I work my passage? The thing seemed
impossible, but why should I not? why should
not I work as well as another? was I composed of
more precious material than other men? If not,
why should I be exempt from their tolls and hardships?
The possibility of such a thing gave me
new life, and I went to bed and slept more soundly
than I had done since I heard of my father's death.
I rose early in the morning, paid for my lodging, for
I had not ventured to eat anything at the hotel, told
the clerk that I would send an order for my baggage,
and sallied out, resolutely bent on looking
steadily at Fortune, let her frown upon me as harshly
as she might.</p>

<p>It was the last day of November; a cold, dreary,
drizzling day; a dirty yellowish vapour hung over
the city, so impervious to the sun's rays, that from
any luminous appearance in the sky it was impossible

<!-- page 15 -->

to determine in what quarter of the heavens
the great illuminator of our globe was shedding his
beams. A suffocating stench of coal smoke pervaded
the atmosphere, and everything dripped,
dripped, dripped, dismally with rain; the gutters
poured out never-failing streams of muddy water,
too thick and slow to make a bubble; most of the
shops had gas lights burning; and the fish-women,
with baskets of herrings upon their heads, as they
waded their miserable rounds, seemed too disheartened
to cry their scaly commodities. Everybody
was encased in oil-cloth, as though rain was a matter
of course, quite the natural order of things; and
women stalked securely through the streets with
high pattens on their feet, which showed that long
practice had enabled them to walk securely on those
dangerous-looking stilts. Heavy, dismal, cheerless.
I wonder now that I had the heart, in such an atmosphere,
to keep my resolve. One such a day in
New-York would create a panic, but here it was a
matter of course. If it produced any effect at all,
it only caused a trifling increase in the consumption
of ale. If a traveller were to enter Liverpool on a
clear day, he would be likely to notice the great
number of "ale and spirit vaults," sooner than anything
else; but on a day like this he would not think
there was one too many; although nearly every
other house in the business parts of the town displays
either a bunch of grapes, or an "arms" of
some kind</p>

<p>Travellers pretend to discover a resemblance in
Liverpool to New-York; but the likeness is such as
that of Monmouth to Macedon; there's a river runs
by New-York, and there's a river runs by Liverpool,&mdash;but
here all likeness ends. There are not
two places in the world more unlike.</p>

<p>Having made a cheap breakfast at a gloomy chop-house
in Pool Lane, I went directly to a second-hand

<!-- page 16 -->

clothing dealer's in Dale-street, and exchanged the
clothes I had on for a complete suit of thick sea-togs,
including a varnished sou'wester, a canvass cap lined
with flannel, fitting tight to the head, the hinder part
of it forming a kind of cape for the shoulders to keep
the rain from running down the neck. My clothes
were nearly new, so I received ten shillings besides
the sea-togs, which, added to the remains of my last
sovereign, gave me seventeen shillings; quite a little
fortune, it seemed to me, now that I had got on
a covering which I was not taxed for the privilege
of wearing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE SCATTERGOOD.</p>

</div>


<p>I FELT very sailorish, but a professional observer
would have detected some little incongruities between
my manner and my dress, which would have
revealed the fulness of my pretensions to the character
I had assumed. It would be easier to ape the
port of an emperor than the gait of a sailor. Of all
the shams in the world there is none so easily detected
as a sham sailor. However, regardless of the
rain and the cold, the dismal lowering clouds, and
drooping tendency that seemed to possess everything,
I moved briskly through the dirty lanes and
alleys that conducted me to Prince's Dock, where
the majority of the American ships in port lay. I
went the rounds of the dock, applying to every ship
I found bound home, first for a berth as a sailor, and
then for the privilege of working my passage. I
was on the point of abandoning the pursuit in despair,
when I espied a little dirty-looking bark with
a high poop, which I had at first taken for an Englishman,
with Baltimore painted on her quarter
boards. Her name was the Scattergood, and a full
length figure of her patronymic decorated her cutwater.</p>

<p>Unlike all the other American ships in the dock,
she was a very shabby, disorderly-looking craft: her
rigging all hanging in bights, points and gaskets flying
from her yards, and her side and bulwarks stained
with iron rust, she looked as though she had
been fitted out by the parish. Her decks were in
confusion, and her mates looked like anything but

<!-- page 18 -->

sailors. I stepped on board and asked for the captain;
the cook, a Chinaman, pointed him out to me,
standing upon the poop. He was a feeble little old
man, dressed in a long snuff-coloured surtout; his
hands were encased in a pair of buckskin mittens,
and he was trying to screen himself from the penetrating
mist by holding a faded green cotton umbrella
over his head. The ship, her master, and her
crew, seemed made for each other. But I was not in a
condition to be squeamish; so without taking a very
critical view of the wretched craft, I asked the captain
to ship me as a sailor. He replied in a querulous
piping voice, "No, no, no, I  won't.  I don't want
you. What's your name?" I told him. "Go ashore,
go ashore, go ashore, I won't have you."</p>

<p>To be driven off by such a character rather touched
my pride, and I meant he should have me. So
paying no attention to him, I told him he would miss
it if he didn't take me.</p>

<p>"I won't have you, I can't, I can't, I don't like
your looks; get out of my way, I don't want you."</p>

<p>So far from being intimidated by this unhandsome
repulse, I felt angry with the miserable old skipper,
and resolved he should have me. "If you won't
give me wages," I said, "I will go without pay;
but you must take me; I want to get home to my
friends."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" I told him again.</p>

<p>"Are you a good sailor?"</p>

<p>"No, I am no sailor at all."</p>

<p>"I won't have you. You'll eat too much."</p>

<p>"Shall I go with you?" I said again, pretending
not to hear his last reply.</p>

<p>"Plague on you, yes; if you will only leave me.
The bark will sail after dinner, so bring your kit
right off."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," I replied, and jumping
ashore, I ran to the hotel where I had left my

<!-- page 19 -->

baggage, and delivering an order for it which I had
written myself, the porter gave me my trunk and
carpet-bag, without recognising me, and I took
them upon my back and bore them off to the bark,
where I stowed them away in the forecastle; very
strange looking baggage for a sailor. The forecastle
was a wretched hole. It was even with the ship's
deck, a mere shelter from the rain, called a top-gallant
forecastle. The berths were merely rough
boards loosely nailed together; and, as the chain-cables
led directly through it, warmth and comfort
were utter impossibilities, for the hawse-holes would
admit water in all weathers, when there was the
least motion to the ship, and the bulk-head was too
slight and rickety to keep out the wind. It was not
a very encouraging prospect for a winter passage
across the Atlantic, particularly for me, as I had
but a scanty supply of sea-clothing; but I was not
disheartened by it. Anything seemed better than
getting in debt. Besides, I should have companions,
and I had too much pride to shrink from anything
which more experienced men made no hesitation
in encountering. It appeared, however, that
the ship's whole crew had run away on account of
this very top-gallant forecastle, and a new crew had
been shipped, who shook their heads and looked
very dismal when they saw what accommodations
they had got to put up with. However, it was too
late for repentance, they had received their month's
advance, and were forced to go, but they looked
very grim about it. When all the sailors were on
board, the dock-gates were opened, lines were run
out, and we began to warp the bark out into the
stream. I worked as hard as I could, kept falling
over ropes, and hauling upon everything, and raised
dreadful blisters upon my hands. The two mates
flew about from one part of the ship to the other,
made a tremendous noise, were cursed by the pilot

<!-- page 20 -->

and shook their fists at the dock-gate men, who
laughed at them, and called them Yankees. The
wretched little captain stood all the while in a bewildered
state, holding his cotton umbrella over his
head, on the poop-deck, seemingly quite unconscious
where the ship was going, or what they were doing
with her.  The sailors in the midst of all manned the
capstan, and began to sing a manly air with a roaring
chorus, ending  in "Round the rock to Sally."</p>

<p>The two mates were as great curiosities in their
way as the skipper himself. They were brothers;
one of them wore a bob-tailed pepper and salt coat,
with steel buttons, such as the flashy grocers in
Orange and Mulberry streets wear when they go
down town to buy cheap goods at auction, and the
other, the second mate, sported a blue embroidered
jacket, with large frogs, such as the skippers of
Havanna and Mexican traders wear in New-Orleans.
After an inconceivable waste of noise and ill-directed
exertion, the Scattergood got fairly into the stream,
the sails were loosened and sheeted home, a fair
breeze sprung up, the heavy yellow clouds which
had been all the morning hanging over the city began
to loosen and melt away, and just as we rounded
Black-Rock, the sun, which was fast sinking to the
horizon, suddenly burst out, and illumined our
ship with a ray of cheerful light that was quite
electrifying. I was very willing to receive it as a
happy augury, for I had need of something to keep
my spirits from falling to zero.</p>

<p>The little breeze that had sprung up when we
first quitted the dock, died away soon after the sun
went down, the clouds all disappeared, and as it grew
dark, the stars began to glitter and shine as we lay
becalmed the whole night. And a mercy it was, for
such was the want of order and regularity on board,
that had it chanced to blow hard, we must have gone
to the bottom. It being very still, gave us in the

<!-- page 21 -->

forecastle an opportunity to make the most of our
accommodations. Wretched as they were, my companions
did not appear to regard them as unusual,
from which I supposed they had lived in as uncomfortable
quarters before, and if they had not found
them supportable, would never have sought such
again; and I took heart, determined not to repine at
what others could endure with cheerfulness, although
it seemed to me impossible that I could ever live,
even for one passage across the Atlantic, in such a
hole.</p>

<p>It was quite dark before we were ordered to go
to our supper, and as the matches had not been
chosen, all hands went into the forecastle, excepting
only the man at the wheel, (the helmsman.) A tub
of boiled salt beef, very salt and very hard, resembling
a knotty piece of mahogany, and another tub
of navy bread, biscuits made of wheaten bran, called
middlings, were brought to us by the cook, who informed
us that no small stores, tea, coffee and molasses,
were allowed. Some of the sailors grumbled
a little at this information, and asked for a light, and
the steward brought word from the captain that no
light would be allowed. This caused a more general
murmur of discontent, but one of the sailors had
brought a pound of candles on board in his chest,
and he lighted one and stuck it in an empty porter
bottle that we had found in the forecastle, and good
humour soon prevailed among us. The sailors'
chests served for seats, and we arranged ourselves in
a very small circle, with the beef and bread in the
centre, and helped ourselves in turn, the oldest sailor
taking the piece of beef in his hands first, and passing
it round. I had eaten nothing since morning, and I
had a voracious appetite; repulsive as this manner
of carving seemed to me, I was rather impatient for
my turn at the kid. I believe I ate my share of the
bread and beef, although I could not help contrasting

<!-- page 22 -->

this meal with my last on shore, and thinking of
Mivart's and the Star and Garter. I am not certain
that I ever enjoyed one better. It was the first
bread and meat that I had ever eaten in the sweat
of my own brow. One of the crew had brought on
board a small jug of beer, for rum was too costly a
drink to be indulged in, which he served out to us,
reserving no larger share for himself than he gave
to the others. There was a fraternal kindness in
this little act, that impressed me very favourably towards
my shipmates. A jug of beer is no great
matter on shore, but at the outset of a winter passage
across the Atlantic, in a ship where no drops
of comfort of any kind could be looked for, but a
great many of cold water were certain, it required
a degree of generosity amounting almost to heroism,
to enable one to share such a precious cordial with
others. The generous fellow who dealt out his beer
so freely, proved to be one of the most chivalrous
souls I have ever known. In the little time that we
were together, I witnessed so many acts of true
heroism in him, actions performed in the dark, when
he was not conscious of being seen, that I have ever
entertained a high regard for his memory. He
called himself Jack Plaskett, though I found afterwards
it was an assumed name. He was young,
exceedingly good-looking, and, though a thorough
sailor, well educated, and evidently accustomed to
the society of very different associates from his
present forecastle companions. There was a mystery
about him which I could not unravel. He was
rather an exception to, than a specimen of, the
sailor character. But disinterestedness is by no
means a rare virtue in the forecastle.</p>

<p>Another thing that pleased me among my rude
companions, was their cutting off the best piece
of beef and putting it aside for their absent companion&mdash;the
man at the wheel. I found that sailors were

<!-- page 23 -->

very exact in the performance of certain little
punctilios in their conduct towards each other, and
that they regarded a breach of their code of sea
morals with superstitious fear. I heard one relate
a story of a shipmate who once called the watch ten
minutes too soon, and the next night fell from aloft
and was drowned; a judgment that he seemed to
consider neither doubtful, nor disproportioned to the
offence.</p>

<p>The hardships of sailors are so unmixed with
pleasures; their sufferings are so certain, and their
deprivations so much a matter of course, that they
can never afford to look upon the dark side of their
circumstances. If they should once stop to think,
they would be lost; nothing but the most determined
cheerfulness can ever keep them in heart.
When they do murmur, it is about the most inconsiderable
trifles, as if they did it to keep their thoughts
from dwelling on their real grievances.</p>

<p>When our supper was finished, instead of indulging
in gloomy anticipations, or of wasting any idle
regrets over their past days of joviality, they blew
out the candle, with a praiseworthy spirit of economy,
and began to sing a dismal ballad with a chorus.
It is a great mistake to suppose that vulgar
people have vulgar tastes; at least the uneducated
vulgar. They are always fond of sentiment. The
popular forecastle ditties might be sung by a choir
of nuns. There are a few boisterous songs that
have found their way to the forecastle, but they are
rather tolerated than admired, and I have noticed
that sailors always listen to them with a very apparent
disrelish; but when the ballad is long drawn
out, with the sufferings of some distressed damsel, if
a princess all the better, or the miseries of some despairing
cavalier, they will sit like children listening
to the witch stories of an old beldame; and the sad
strain seems to touch a responsive chord, in every

<!-- page 24 -->

bosom. Dibdin's sea songs are very admirable for
nautical dramas, but they are as ill adapted to the
forecastle as Italian bravuras are for real lovers. A
genuine sea song never contains any nautical slang;
that would be homely and common-place; but in the
theatre it satisfies the sentiment; for sentiment can
only endure what is foreign.</p>

<p>Our songs did not last long, for the mate came to
the door of the forecastle and mustered us all upon
deck to choose watches. There were twelve of us,
and the chief mate had his first choice of men. The
second mate represents the captain, and makes the
second selection. They chose a man alternately,
and by this means the good and bad are equally distributed
in the two watches. The first man chosen
was Jack Plaskett, and the mate showed his discrimination
in selecting him; but his superiority
was so obvious that he would have been a dolt not
to have done so. Fortunately for me, I got in the
mate's watch, for I was anxious to be put in the
same watch with Jack. As I had brought no bed
on board, not knowing that bedding was not provided
by the ship, I was obliged to ask one of the
other watch to allow me the privilege of sleeping in
his berth when he was on deck. I met with no difficulty
in finding somebody who allowed me this
privilege, and I turned in at eight o'clock and slept
soundly till twelve, when we were called up to let
the other watch turn in. It was not very pleasant
to turn out of a warm berth and stand four hours on
deck; but the night being calm, though cold, I soon
coiled myself on deck and fell asleep; but I woke
before the watch had half expired, almost dead with
cold. The wind had changed again, and we were
enveloped in sleet, the decks were slippery, and the
motion of the ship being quick and jerking, owing
partly to the short waves caused by the current running
opposite to the wind, and partly to the dead

<!-- page 25 -->

weight of our cargo, it was with great difficulty that
I could stand upon my feet. My hands were blistered
and cracked, and the salt water, though it
probably had a healing effect, yet gave me indescribable
pain. There was a good deal of work
above and aloft, but I could only haul upon a rope
when it was put into my hands, for I could neither
understand the orders that were given, nor execute
them when explained to me. At four o'clock the
starboard watch was called, and we again turned in,
but I was so wet and cold, and my hands were so
painful, that I found it impossible to sleep; and I
was not sorry when the watch was again called at
half-past seven to turn out. We were called half
an hour before the watch had expired, to give us
time to get breakfast, that the other watch might
have their full time below. Or at least this is the
general practice, but in this case the other watch
was not allowed to turn in after breakfast, as it was
necessary for all hands to work in putting the ship
in order while she was in the channel. Our breakfast
consisted only of the remains of the dry piece
of indigestible beef that had served for our suppers,
and a bit of hard bread. I thought it hard fare, and
when I saw the steward taking the cabin breakfast
aft, consisting of hot coffee and boiled potatoes, I
blushed to find myself following the smoking dish of
humble vegetables with a lickerish eye.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock we discharged our pilot off
Point Linus. There was too high a sea running to
allow the small boat to be lowered, and they threw
a rope from the pilot boat, which the pilot fastened
under his arms in a bowline, leaped overboard, and
in that manner was drawn on board his boat; as the
two vessels neared each other, the cook threw on
board the pilot boat a piece of salt beef. This I
found was the custom when a pilot is taken on
board or discharged. All hands were now set to

<!-- page 26 -->

work, seizing on scotchmen, that is, fastening long
strips of board upon the stays and rigging, where
they come in contact with the ship's yards, to prevent
chafing; so that a ship at sea looks as though
she has been wounded in her rigging, and all the
sore places had bandages upon them. This was
simple work, and I had no very great difficulty in
doing my part; but when I first went aloft I could
not work with that feeling of security which comes
to one after a little practice; my head swam when
I looked down upon deck, and twice I came near
falling; and my sickness increased when I went to
mast-head, but I found that continual exercise helped
to cure me. The sailors soon discerned my
greenness, but were very patient in explaining the
names and uses of the ropes, and in teaching me the
art of making knots.</p>

<p>The wind was ahead, the fog was very dense, and
in consequence of the narrowness of the channel, we
were compelled to tack the ship every two hours,
which kept us very busy, and my arms were so
cramped and lame from continued hauling, it was
painful to lift my hand above my head. As night
approached the wind increased, and we were forced
to shorten sail to close-reefed topsails and a reefed
foresail and jib.</p>

<p>Our miserable little captain walked back and forth
in front of the poop, with his hands behind him,
looking pale and frightened, and every now and then
called one of his mates to him and asked him what
he thought about it. It was plain enough that the
captain thought it a very doubtful prospect. The only
man on board excepting the officers, who had
left home in the ship, was a Dutch carpenter, who
informed us that this was the captain's first voyage.
I was sufficiently startled at this, but much more so
when he said that our captain was a tailor; that six
months before he commanded a clothing-store in

<!-- page 27 -->

Philadelphia: but with a hope of improving his
health and his fortune, he had sold out his establishment
and bought this old ship, worn out in the Canton
trade, and had shipped the two brothers now on
board for his navigators; obtained a freight for Liverpool
in Savannah, and was now returning with a
load of salt for Philadelphia. The ship was leaky,
her rigging was rotten, and her sails old; and to increase
the catalogue of our mischances, the mates
were in the habit of indulging in too strong potations
of brandy. A knowledge of our condition had
a disheartening effect on the crew, for they were all
old sailors, who knew the dangers of the channel,
and the rough time we should have of it on our passage
across the Atlantic. While a sailor can have
confidence in his officers, he dismisses all care for
himself, knowing that there is somebody who will
neglect nothing essential to his safety; but joviality
loves not the companionship of care, and I found
that sailors could be serious and thoughtful, like
their betters, when they felt that self-preservation
depended upon their own exertions.</p>

<p>Instead of songs and long yarns, when we went
into the forecastle, the watch debated the chances of
our getting safe out of the channel; every one had
some dismal tale to tell of shipwreck and danger.
One of the watch was a native of the Isle of Man,
and his intimate knowledge of the reefs and shoals
in that part of the channel where we now were,
added to his apprehension, and many a frightful story
did he tell us of shipwrecks about the coast, which
he had witnessed when a boy. The mates had never
been in the channel before, one of them having
been always employed in the Canton trade, and the
other had only been in the coasting service.</p>

<p>We kept constantly tacking during the night, and
once we narrowly escaped plumping upon a reef of
rocks, called the Calf of Man, The fog was thick;

<!-- page 28 -->

and suddenly a light flashed on our deck from the leeward;
the man on the look out cried out "breakers,
breakers, put down your helm!" The watch jumped
out upon deck, for they had not undressed themselves,
but lay down in their wet clothes on their
chests, and we succeeded in getting the ship headed
round on the other tack. The light seemed close
aboard of us, and it could not have been far off, or
we could not have seen it through the fog. At daylight
the fog lifted a little, like a curtain, just to
show us the Welsh coast under our lee, and then
shut down again, more dense and impenetrable than
ever. The wind continuing to blow, we were not
able to make any sail, so we drifted back towards
the Isle of Man again, and continued, to tack every
two hours during the day. Excitement and hard
work together, had entirely cured my sea-sickness,
and I began to feel myself of some consequence. I
could run about deck without falling, and go to any
rope in the dark that I was ordered to; it still made
me dizzy to go aloft, but soon this feeling began to
wear off. The wind and the fog continued, and
some of the sailors said they had known such weather
to last in the channel more than a mouth.  We began
to calculate the chances of escape in the forecastle,
in the event of the ship getting ashore, and the most
experienced among us agreed that they were very
slender. The sailors tied up their little valuables in
handkerchiefs, to be prepared for quitting the ship at
a moment's warning, for the ignorance of our officers
was now apparent, and we had very nearly the
command of the vessel; the man at the wheel taking
it upon himself to tell the captain when it was time
to tack the ship.</p>

<p>Nothing was further from my thoughts than a wish
to create dissatisfaction among the crew, but I
thought it mould be a wicked deference to the
captain of the ship, merely because he was our superior

<!-- page 29 -->

in office, to allow him to peril our lives and
the safety of his ship, without remonstrating with
him, and I told the crew that it was their duty to
advise him to put back to Liverpool, and provide
himself with suitable officers and a new suit of sails,
before he attempted to cross the Atlantic. The majority
of them shook their heads at the proposition,
for they said it could be construed as mutiny; but
Jack Plaskett was in favour of the measure, and
offered to stand by me if I would make a move.
But seeing that I was the youngest man in the forecastle,
and only a green hand, I thought it would
be rather a bold step, and declined, unless they
would all go aft with me. This they refused to do,
and we had another fearful night. The next day
our little captain appeared quite bewildered and beside
himself; the mates were half drunk, and
acknowledged that neither they nor the captain
knew where the ship was. The storm continued
without abatement, and at four o'clock in the afternoon,
I discovered a very high bluff through the fog
at the leeward, and ran aft and told the captain
that there was land under our lee. "I know it,"
he replied. "Do you know what land it is?" I
said. "Yes, it's Bluemorris." "No," I said, "it is
not Beaumaris; we are on the opposite side of the
channel; this is either the coast of Lancashire or
Ireland; and if you don't put the ship about, we
shall be ashore in a few minutes." "Do you think
so?" he said, looking very much terrified, "then tell
the mate to 'bout ship."</p>

<p>By the time the ship was put upon the other tack,
we were very close in shore, and the land was so
distinctly visible, that our Manxman in the forecastle
knew it to be St. Bee's head.  A very few
minutes longer, and we should have been ashore.
The wind increased as the sun went down, and we
reefed the foresail, took in the jib, and close-reefed

<!-- page 30 -->

the spanker. The mates, seeing that the captain
was frightened, grew frightened themselves, and
drank so much brandy that they were soon stupidly
drunk; the captain retired to his cabin and locked
himself in, and then there was no officer upon deck.
The storm continued to increase, the wind drew
more to the north, and the fog turned to hail. I
now told the men that there was no other course
left for us but to take charge of the ship, and try to
preserve her until morning, and then advise the
captain to return to Liverpool, and if he should
hesitate, to compel him. They agreed to be governed
by my advice. But I was entirely incapable of
giving any in regard to the management of the ship,
and as none of us knew anything about the tides or
the depth of water, or the proper course to be steered,
I told the carpenter, if he would go to the captain's
cabin and get his chart and navigator, I would
try to prick off our course; for I had learned something
about navigation at school, and the captain of
the Philadelphia, in our passage to London, had
taught me how to mark a ship's position on the
chart. The captain had locked himself in his state-room,
and the only way we could get at his chart
was by forcing the lid off his chest. This the carpenter
did, and by the aid of a pair of dividers and
a ruler, I found that we were a few miles southeast
of St. Bee's head, on the coast of Lancashire, and
that the tide was drifting us directly on shore. I
called Jack Plaskett, and told him our situation;
and he said that the only way of saving the ship
would be to make more sail, but he was afraid of
carrying away the spars if we did so. We held a
consultation with the rest of the crew, and it was at
last determined to make sail. We accordingly shook
a reef out of the foresail, hoisted the jib, loosed the
mainsail, and then set the spanker. As we got
aboard the main tack, and  flattened in the jib shoat,

<!-- page 31 -->

the increased force of the wind caused the ship to
leap and plunge like a spirited horse when the whip
is applied to his back. The masts bent like a poplar
tree in a nor'wester, and every time she plunged
into the waves, I thought they would all have gone
by the board. Every man was on deck, ready to
execute an order the moment it was given; and the
carpenter stood at the mainmast with an axe in his
hand, to cut away the masts if we should strike the
bottom; the long-boat was got ready for hoisting
out; and the lead was kept going, to find out whether
we shoaled the water. As I was the least efficient
hand on deck, I stationed myself on the foretopsail-yard,
to look out for breakers, but the cold was so
intense that I could not remain long. Not one of
the crew lay down for the night, and by morning
we were all pretty well exhausted; but as day
was breaking, the captain and mate both came on
deck. It was time to tack ship, for I judged we
were well over upon the Welsh coast, as it proved we
were when it grew lighter, and I told the captain he
had better put the ship about. He gave orders to
the mate to do so, and we wore round. The wind
had moderated a little, and the ship laboured less
than she had during the night; but the press of canvass
that she was still under, made it rather unsafe
and uncomfortable to stand upon deck.</p>

<p>It was now certain that we should have another
such a night as the last, and perhaps a worse one,
unless we carried our resolution into effect, and
compelled the captain to put back. The crew were
faint-hearted, but I called them together and told
them they had nothing to fear; that the captain
would be ashamed to make any complaint against
us, and that if he did so, we could easily prove by
the carpenter and steward, that but for our exertions
the ship would have been lost; and instead of
blame, they would get the thanks of the insurers, at

<!-- page 32 -->

least. I tried to prevail upon the oldest sailor to be
spokesman for us, but he urged that he had no gift
of speaking; and as they all said that I could do it
best, I consented, very unwillingly, to take the lead,
knowing that if any difficulty should ensue, that I
would be singled out as the ringleader. I accordingly
marched aft to the cabin-door, with all the
crew at my back, and asked for the captain. The
mates turned pale as they saw us coming, and retreated
into their hurricane-house, and the captain
came out trembling, and asked what we wanted</p>

<p>I represented to him that the crew were unwilling
to continue the voyage, unless the ship were better
supplied with sails; and that it was their
opinion, his proper course would be to square his
yards and go back to Liverpool, and wait for a fair
wind, before he ventured out to sea again. Two or
three of the sailors spoke up, and said they thought
so too. The captain looked very much puzzled,
but ruminating a minute or two, he said he thought
we were about half right, called out for the mate,
and told him to square the yards and go back into
port. I was rejoiced to hear this, for I was fearful
of being compelled to speak in a harsher manner;
and we all went to work shaking reefs out of the
topsails, and making sail,&mdash;for as soon as we began
to sail before the wind, it seemed comparatively
light. By ten o'clock we were opposite Point Linus,
where we took another pilot, and that evening,
at dusk, we dropped anchor opposite George's Dock,
in Liverpool. As I had neither signed the ship's
papers, nor taken any advance wages, I had a right
to leave the ship when I pleased, and I made up my
mind to do so without delay, and to take the precaution
of inquiring whether the captain of any
other ship I could get on board of were a tailor or
a sailor before I went to sea again. My shipmates
looked upon me as a hero, and said that if I left the

<!-- page 33 -->

bark, they would not remain behind. A wherry
came off from the shore, and they bargained with
the boatman to come back at midnight with a larger
boat to take us all from the ship. It chanced to be
a clear starry night, and one of the mates kept
watch to prevent the desertion of the crew. The
boat was rowed a long distance above the ship, and
then dropped down directly in range of her bows, so
that she could not be seen from the poop, where the
mate was walking. We all passed our dunnage,
chests and hammocks, over the bow without being
discovered, and then jumped into the boat, and
shoved off, leaving only the cook and steward behind.
I felt very happy to be free from such an
uncomfortable and dangerous craft; and now that I
knew what I could endure in the way of work and
hard fare, I felt much better prepared to take the
rough side of things, than I did before I had been
tried. As I was a stranger in Liverpool, I was
compelled to follow my shipmates after we got
ashore to their boarding-house, at the sign of the
Ship in Old Hall-street, where they spent the remainder
of the night in drinking ale, smoking, and
singing. I had some fear of difficulty with the little
tailor captain, and, to keep out of his reach, I went
to live with an acquaintance of Mrs. Collins, the
landlady of the Ship, who occupied a cellar near
the Clarence Dock, and supported herself by washing
for sailors. Her husband was a Swede, who
occasionally earned a trifle as a ship-keeper. Their
entire establishment consisted of two very small
rooms in the cellar of a new brick house, the upper
part of which was occupied by people in the higher
walks of life, as was very proper; two families&mdash;one
the family of a ship-joiner, and the other a block-maker.
Of course, we in the cellar had no communication
with those so much above us. My hostess
was an excellent woman,&mdash;devout, neat, cheerful;

<!-- page 34 -->

her husband was a quiet, intelligent man, and unaffectedly
pious. In the evening, when her work was
done, and her hearth cleanly swept, one or two of
her gossips would drop in with their sewing, generally
some part of a sailor's wardrobe, for it was a
marine neighbourhood, and I used to listen to their
conversation with pleasure and profit. One woman
interested me above all the others. She was a meek,
gentle creature, whose husband belonged to a fishing
smack; she busied herself all the time of his absence,
in mending his clothes, and selling the fish
that he brought; and he repaid her by spending his
earnings at the ale-house, and beating her when he
came home to her drunk. This I learned from one
of her cronies, for she made no complaints of the
brute herself, but when spoken to about her husband,
she would look as cheerful as she could, and say,
"James is doing pretty well, but he will do better
one of these days."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, my host and hostess, indulged
in the luxury of meat only on Sundays; at
other times, bread and butter formed the staple of
our meals; and, Saturday night was quite a gala
night with them, for then, in company with some of
their neighbours, they went to St. George's Market,
and after promenading through long avenues of
vegetables, game, poultry and fruits, and pricing
rounds of beef, saddles of venison, cauliflowers and
oranges, they would come home bringing a small
bit of beef in a very large covered basket; and the
price of provisions furnished a topic of conversation
until the recurrence of another Saturday night. I
never expected to regard a piece of baked beef and
potatoes as a very grand affair, but it was impossible
to sit down with these honest people to their Sunday
dinner without sympathizing with their feelings.
The meat was salted and dredged with flour over
night, all ready for the oven, to avoid unnecessary

<!-- page 35 -->

work on Sunday morning, and placed upon a high
shelf, and covered with a snowy white napkin. In
the morning Peterson took it to the baker's with an
air bordering on grandeur; holding his head higher
than on ordinary occasions, for he had a drooping
habit on other days, as though he had no right to
carry his head erect. But when he brought it home&mdash;that
was the most trying time, for all house-keepers
know that beef will shrink in baking, if not
killed in the right quarter of the moon, and to people
who eat beef but once a week, it is a matter of
intense curiosity whether their joint has shrunk or
swollen in the oven.</p>

<p>"I don't think it has shrunk much, Peterson,"
the cheerful creature would say, as she looked
anxiously at the pan when Peterson placed it upon
the table.</p>

<p>"Shrunk! no, I believe, as I am living, it is
greater as ever," the hopeful Peterson would reply,
smacking his lips as he looked at the unusual
luxury.</p>

<p>"At all events, there's plenty of gravy, and the
potatoes are browned very nice," said Mrs. Peterson.</p>

<p>"They are lovely; I don't believe as the king has
got better spuds for dinner as them," responded her
husband</p>

<p>The little deal table was spread with very humble
appointments, but in the purity of neatness, and
when we took our seats, Mrs. Peterson asked a
blessing, a longer one than usual, not only because
the dinner was better, but to prolong the enjoyment
and make the most of it. Mrs. Peterson not only
said grace, but she carved, her husband being inexpert
with the knife, and made an imposing ceremony
of it. First, the knife must be deliberately sharpened;
then its edge must be felt; then the fork must be
thrust into the beef, and a little time taken up in

<!-- page 36 -->

observing whether the juice were red or not; then
the joint must be properly placed in the dish, and
after a preliminary flourish with the knife, the first
slice is cut; rich, juicy; and altogether delightful;
quite beyond the suspicion of a fault. It is necessary
to eat baked beef and potatoes under such circumstances,
to comprehend their merits, and so eaten,
they are finer, more digestible and healthier,
than any fricandeau that ever came from the hands
of a Parisian cook. Mrs. Peterson was not entirely
free from human weaknesses, and with a vanity that
none but a very pious person could condemn, she
informed me that she and Peterson had often had a
gooseberry tart for dinner in the summer when fruit
was plenty, and that once they had been the owners
of quite a large basket of American apples, which
were presented to them by the <i>sthuard</i> of a liner.
And the fragrant recollections of these rarities served
a long while for a dessert after dinner; and it gave
me greater pleasure to hear her tell of them than it
would to have partaken of them.</p>

<p>It was impossible to remain long in the society of
Mr. and Mrs. Peterson (by the way, nobody but
myself ever applied the Mr. to Peterson's name,)
without feeling conscious that the hearts of these
good people must be buoyed up by the recollection
of some departed glory which had once surrounded
them. There was a mysterious dignity, a solemn
content, which seemed to envelope them, as though
they were not what they seemed, but were willing
that the world should regard them as a childless
couple, living happily on four shillings a week; only,
if the world did but know something which they
knew themselves! Such an air the rebel duke of
Berwick must have had, when he used to sit with his
peasant wife in the company of his rude neighbours,
who never suspected him of being better than themselves,
except in manners; and so Louis Philippe

<!-- page 37 -->

must have seemed, when he earned his bread by
teaching a school. I had partly made up my mind
that Peterson was, at the least, a descendant of
Gustavus Vasa, when the secret of their quiet dignity
leaked out. Their fire-side had once been
blessed by the presence of an angel, a little boy-angel,
a child of their own, who was too bright, too
beautiful for this world, and had been taken home
to Heaven. Little Frederick! There never was such
a child; everybody said so, even Mrs. Briton, the
baker's wife. It was foreseen from the first that
the child would never live to grow up; Peterson, himself,
who of course knew the child thoroughly, said
more than a hundred times, "that child is too knowing
to live." The child died before it reached its
first birth day, and yet, would anybody believe that
there could be people in the world of a nature so
depraved as to doubt, nay, even to positively say,
that there never had been such a child; that little
Frederic was a humbug? To the disgrace of humanity,
it cannot be denied there were such people;
and to the disgrace of the female sex, it must be
owned that one such person was a lady, Mrs. Barker,
the wife of another ship-keeper, who had never had
any children of her own, and was unwilling that any
of her neighbours should have the advantage of her
in that respect. But there were little Frederick's
shoes, as genuine a pair of dear little shoes as ever
were worn upon a baby's feet, and there was the
cradle, and the spoon, and the little cups. How
could anybody refuse to believe in little Frederick?
For my own part, I believe in little Frederick as
firmly as I do in any of my creditors, and were it
not for my sins, I should expect to meet him in
Heaven.</p>

<p>In the family of the ship-joiner above our heads,
lived, as a servant, a pretty black-eyed Jewess.
Her name was Antoinette; her family name I have

<!-- page 38 -->

forgotten. Her father was a wealthy jeweller, with
a house at Everton, and she had been turned out
of doors for joining the established church; and
having received but an indifferent education, and
being shunned by all her tribe, she had been compelled
to go to service for a livelihood. She, too,
was an occasional visiter in Mrs. Peterson's cellar,
and her black eyes and rosy lips gave a tinge of romance
to the homely scene; for Mrs. Peterson herself
was a plain woman, as were all her cronies, the
brightness of their womanhood having faded, or
rather lost its glossiness of surface, and like a
piece of good cloth, showed the fineness of the
material of which it was composed the better for
it. And here the pretty Christianized Jewess
and Jack Plaskett met one evening by accident,
and fell in love with each other directly. He
was too honourable to marry her and leave her to
toil in a kitchen, and she loved him too well to let
him leave her; so, like a fond Jessica, she proposed
to put on the habit of a sailor and follow him to sea.
But he would not consent to it, knowing, as she did
not, the perils and hardships of a sailor's life. Although
her father had turned her from his doors,
and would allow neither her brothers nor sisters to
afford her any relief, she loved them still, and used to
make them stealthy visits by night, always creeping
like a menial into the kitchen door of her father's
house. Once I accompanied her there with Jack
Plaskett, and we stopped at the corner of the street,
while she went in alone. It was a handsome house,
with a large garden in the rear, and from the appearance
of numerous lights and the bustle of servants,
I supposed they must be entertaining company.
She was gone but a few minutes, and returned
to us weeping. She refused to tell what had happened,
but I heard afterwards that she had encountered
her father in the garden, and that he took her

<!-- page 39 -->

by the arm and thrust her rudely into the street. I
know not whether her family were ever reconciled
to her; and as Jack Plaskett was drowned on his
next voyage, I fear that poor Antoinette is still a
patient drudge in some humble kitchen. Perhaps
she is in Heaven.</p>

<p>The Scattergood lay in the river but three or four
days, and then sailed with a fair wind and a new
crew. I believe she reached Philadelphia that
voyage, but was wrecked the next. As soon as she
was fairly under way, I left my troglodytish lodging
and rose into the upper air; and after much trouble,
succeeded in getting a berth on board a New-York
liner, the name of which I must omit, lest I
give offence to somebody in the course of my little
narrative. She was a new ship, I believe it was
only her second voyage, well equipped, strongly
manned, a fast sailer, and a perfect beauty to look
at. She was the handsomest vessel in port. Everything
about her was neat, substantial, and in perfect
order. She had a flush deck, as smooth as a
nine-pin alley, varnished waists, which looked like
a strip of yellow satin, and a gilded billet-head, with
scroll-work, copied from some of Raphael's frescoes,
for it was before poop-decks, painted ports,
and figure-heads had come in fashion. There were
three mates, two stewards, two cooks, twenty sailors,
two boys, and a carpenter. We hauled out of dock
on the 14th of December, and in three days were
out of the channel and past Cape Clear. The
weather was cold and murky, the nights were long
and dreary, but our officers were experienced, the
ship was new, and I had a home in prospect, so I
looked resolutely ahead, and strove to forget my
present discomforts by imagining future pleasures.</p>

<p>Our forecastle was a handsome apartment compared
with the wretched top-gallant forecastle of
the Scattergood. Our fare, too, was comparatively

<!-- page 40 -->

sumptuous; a tin pot full of tea every night and
morning, sweetened with Cuba molasses; it was
not exactly pecco, but it was hot, and quite as wholesome
as Oulong Souchong; and the weather being
very cold, even the hot steam was refreshing.  In
addition to this luxury, we were served twice a week
with a kid of lob-skous, a hash of salt meat and potatoes,
seasoned with a dash of hot water, which
made it very acceptable, after we had worked hard
in the wet and cold all night. And then we had the
very great luxury of a tub of hot mush and molasses
occasionally, very nearly, but not quite so good as
that which is given to criminals in our city prison.
I do not mean, by this comparison, to intimate that
we were entitled to as good fare as prisoners, because
they are frequently gentlemen, who have been
used to better times, and of course are entitled to
more consideration than mere sailors, who are generally
treated as though they were entitled to nothing
but hard work and hard words.</p>

<p>We had the same labour to perform on board the liner
the first few days after leaving port, that we
had on board the Scattergood; for it is the practice
on board of all ships, to strip their rigging and spars
of all superfluous gear, when lying in the dock, to
give them an appearance of neatness and order.
But as we had more men in proportion to the size
of our ship, our work was sooner finished, and we
were indulged with watch-and-watch,&mdash;four hours
on deck, and four hours below, night and day, excepting
when we were making or taking in sail;
and then all hands were kept at work. It is the
custom on board of packet ships, to carry sail as
long as possible, and often when they do attempt to
take it in, they are obliged to let it go altogether.
It sometimes happens that the officer on deck is not
possessed of sufficient judgment to know when to
take in and when to make sail, and thereby the

<!-- page 41 -->

greater part of those disasters at sea, which we read
of in the papers, take place, and are attributed
rather to the violence of storms, than to the ignorance
of commanders. Some shipmasters never
meet with accidents at sea, while others are a continued
drain upon underwriters, by carrying away
spars and sails. But that instinctive prudence which
warns a man when to shorten sail, is a rare virtue
on land as well as at sea.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that our officers, though old
sailors, were entirely deficient of judgment; and
they seemed as thoughtless as children about making
and taking in sail, and I began to feel apprehensive
of danger. The weather was so changeable that we
were rarely allowed to sleep out our entire four
hours below, being turned out continually, either to
make or shorten sail. Hardly would we get warm
in our berths, when there would come a thumping
upon deck above our heads, and the gruff voice of
one of the watch would roar out, "Larboard watch
a-h-o-o-o-y! tumble up, tumble up, and shorten
sail." This at last became so unpleasant, that the
chief mate, in whose watch I was stationed, seeing
a squall to leeward one dark night, swore he would
reef topsails without turning up the other watch,
hoping that they would be induced to imitate the
example. This we could have done without difficulty,
if he had made the attempt in season; but he
delayed it, with his usual foolhardiness, until the
squall struck us, and then tried to carry out his designs,
for he was one of those foolishly resolute men,
who will persist in an attempt when they see that
success is impossible. In order to increase his force,
he called the man on the lookout away from his post,
and placed a boy at the wheel; and, when we had
succeeded in hauling out the reef-tackles of the
mizzen topsail, he sent everybody aloft, thus leaving
the ship, in the commencement of a threatening

<!-- page 42 -->

squall, with nobody on deck but himself to take care
of her. The sailors murmured as they went aloft at
the danger we were unnecessarily incurring, and
vented a torrent of abusive oaths upon the head
of the foolish mate. He was an old sea-dog, who had
been several times wrecked, and received complimentary
silver watches from passengers, and a gold
chronometer from the board of underwriters, for
his fearlessness and faithful conduct in times
of peril, and for getting ships out of danger in which
his own folly had placed them. He seemed never
easy unless the wind was blowing a hurricane, and
the straining masts were threatening to go by the
board</p>

<p>We had but just gained the topsail-yard, and were
beginning to haul out the earings, when we heard
a terrible crash, a loud scream, and at the same time
we were almost thrown from the yard, by a shock
as if the ship had struck upon the bottom. We
could not see what had happened, but thought that
the foremast had been carried away by the squall.
It was very dark, but I saw a streak of foam in the
water like that made by the track of a ship, which I
supposed was occasioned by a whirlwind. We hurried
upon deck, and there found that we had been
run into by a ship sailing before the wind with all
the canvass she could stagger under. The captain
and passengers had jumped upon deck in their night
clothes, and the greatest consternation prevailed for
a short time, until it was found that we were not in a
sinking state. The wind blew so strong that the ship
which struck us soon drifted out of sight; and from
her disappearing so suddenly, we thought she had
gone down, and that all on board had perished. But
we afterwards learned that she sustained but a trifling
injury. Our own damage was very serious;
the ship had struck us on the cut-water, and swept
everything off, bowsprit, head, sails and all. There

<!-- page 43 -->

was a tremendous sea running at the time, and had we
been struck a foot more inboard, the ship must have
sunk before it would have been possible to clear
away our boats. The accident, which seemed unavoidable,
was the effect of pure carelessness and imprudence.
If the man at the lookout had not been
called away from his post, the ship would have been
seen in time to have been avoided</p>

<p>We lay to until daylight, hard at work, clearing
away the wreck, and then squared our yards, and
put back for the Cove of Cork, where we arrived on
New-year's morning.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE COVE.</p>

</div>

<p>HERE we were compelled to discharge our cargo
into lighters, and as our captain and passengers
were impatient of delay, we had to work until midnight
by lanterns, in getting the ship in order for
sea. We had a sore time of it, for it rained nearly
every day, and our work was too urgent to allow us
any rest, except on Sunday, and then but little. But
this little was the sweeter for its rarity; and I enjoyed
one Sunday afternoon ashore at the Cove, and
thought more of the privilege, than I had of all the
time I had spent in travelling at my ease over England
and Scotland</p>

<p>I had discovered in Liverpool, that virtue and
content might dwell together in a cellar and be happy,
with a meat dinner once a week,&mdash;a truth that
had no conception of before; and here I found
that beauty and innocence could grow up in a garret,
and thrive upon potatoes and buttermilk. Although
there were several men-of-war in the harbour,
a New-York liner being a very rare bird, in
these waters, and the most extravagant stories having
been told of the magnificence of our ship's interior
arrangements, caused our crew to be regarded in a
more favourable light than any of the sailors belonging
to the other ships. We were the elect of the
best society, and received many attentions from the
washer-women and small whiskey dealers, which
made us the envy of the other crews on liberty.
One of our crew, who was, in fact, a native of Cork,
introduced us to his relations,&mdash;among the rest, a

<!-- page 45 -->

highly respectable widow, who traded in snuff and
small marine stores. He had boasted a good deal
of his aunt and her store, and he took me there
alone, as if it would not comport with his aunt's pretensions,
to bring the whole crew of common sailors
to her house. We found this excellent lady sitting
at the entrance of her warehouse, selecting out bits
of nails and rusty screws from a heap of scrappy
old iron; she was delighted to see her nephew,
Dennis, and invited us to walk into the parlour
and be comfortable. It was just in the dusk of
the evening, so that the parlour was not very light,
and being illuminated only by such particles of the
sun's beams as could make their way through a little
window of oiled paper, it was not easy at a
glance to discover all that it contained; not that it
was a very magnificent apartment as to its dimensions,
or very much crowded with curious furniture;
on the contrary, the floor was clay, very hard though,
and tidily swept, and the walls were close together.
I heard a singular noise in one corner of the parlour,
and perceiving that the widow seemed anxious
to hide the cause of it, I was not over curious to try
to discover it; but the mystery soon cleared itself
up; a full grown pig started up from a bundle of
straw, and ran squealing past me into the street.
The widow apologized for his rudeness, and said
that he was not in the habit of coming into the
house, but that his companion had been killed the
day before, and he was lonesome, and had come
into the parlour for companionship. Could a better
reason have been given for a pig being found in
one's parlour? I have seen guests in parlours
since, whose presence could not be accounted for in
half so satisfactory a manner. After tasting a drop
of the widow's poteen, and leaving with her a small
package of black tea, we repaired to the house of
Mrs. Donovan, another widow lady; for I found that

<!-- page 46 -->

nearly the entire female population of the Cove consisted
of widows, who lived in a superior manner in
the attic of a tall house, whose chimneys were only
even with the terrace of the hill on the side of which
it was built. Mrs. Donovan was a <i>blanchisseuse;</i>
I dare not speak plainer, and must trust to the
reader being within reach of a French and English
dictionary; and if there is anything in her professional
calling calculated to impart such a sweetness
of temper, such a very tempting complexion, such
dazzling teeth, and so soft a voice as she possessed,
I should recommend all the ladies of my acquaintance
to adopt it in preference, not only to any other,
but in preference to doing nothing. It is true, her
hands were not so white and corpse-like as the
hands of idler ladies are used to be, but they were
more plump and soft for the exercise of her calling.
But what was the widow Donovan, by the side
of her daughter Bridget! A coal droger by the side of
the Queen's yacht; a goose by the side of a turtle
dove; a hollyhock by a moss rose. She was the
widow Donovan, in short, by the side of her daughter
Bridget. Bridget Donovan had budded and
blossomed in the very garret in which I saw her,
probably ignorant of the luxury of a stocking during
the greater part of her life; she was only sixteen,
and as beautiful and bewitching as innocence, youth
and beauty could render her. Although she spoke
English well enough, she could prattle her native
Greek, and sing it too, like a bird; she had a voice
like a bob-o-link, and seemed as happy. We did
not visit without an invitation. No, indeed. Her
mother gave a <i>soiree</i>, expressly in our honour.
All the liners were there, some wearing white shirts
and frock coats, with breast-pins and satin stocks.
O, it was a beautiful time! There were many
other ladies beside the widow and her daughter,
and many beautiful ones, too, but they were nothing

<!-- page 47 -->

by the side of Bridget. I wondered at their venturing
where their charms must be compared with
hers; but it was fortunate they came: else there
would have been fighting, and perhaps bloodshed,
in striving for the honour of sitting by the widow's
daughter.</p>

<p>When we first came in we had poteen, (it was
before Father Mathew's day,) and afterwards
wheaten cakes, with butter and coffee; unusual
luxuries, I fear, in the sky-parlour of the widow
Donovan! Then we had songs, genuine Irish melodies,
not such faint things as you hear in theatres
and concert rooms, nor such words as you find in
Tom Moore, but better, a good deal better. More
poteen and dancing. Reels, three-handed, five-handed,
and seven-handed. And I danced with Bridget
Donovan, set after set, and I felt very happy. I
knew that I ought not to be,&mdash;that I had more cause
for grief than merriment,&mdash;that I was out of my
proper sphere, in a low situation, herding with people
in whose company I should not be seen; but I
could not help it: I never enjoyed myself better;
and when it was time to go, I began to dream how
delightful it would be to stay altogether. I bade
farewell to Bridget, and have never seen her again,
excepting in my dreams.</p>

<p>Dennis, who had introduced us to his aunt, gave
me another instance of his partiality. While we
were reloading one day he called me aside, and told
me he had formed a high opinion of my abilities, and
knew I was a lad he could depend upon, and asked
me if I had a mind to join him in a little speculation.
I asked for an explanation. He said the mate
trusted to him every night to lock up the hatches,
and as we were now taking on board bales of cloth,
he had selected one which he judged, from its size
and weight, must be fine broadcloth, and had hid it
between decks, with an intention of leaving the

<!-- page 48 -->

forward hatch unlocked, and during his watch on
deck taking it up and stowing it away in his berth.
But as he couldn't well do it alone, he offered to give
me half the spoils if I would assist him. I knew if
I refused that he would persuade another of his
shipmates to join him, and if they were detected they
would suspect me of informing against them. So I
listened to his proposition, and without assenting to
it, told him to let me know when he was ready. He
pointed the bale out to me during the day, which
he had rolled aside, and I contrived, just before the
hatches were closed, to jump down between decks
and tumbled it into the lower hold without being
perceived. He went to look after it that night, and
was in a great rage when he found that it had been
removed. The next day he selected another, which
I disposed of in the same manner, and after that I
contrived to give a hint to the second mate that he
had better see the hatches secured himself. Dennis
never suspected that I was not as great a rogue as
himself, for he was very friendly during the passage,
and rendered me many little kindnesses, which I did
not hesitate to accept, for I considered he was indebted
to me for saving him from committing a
theft. But sailors have a very loose morality in regard
to a ship's cargo, which is not owing so much
to their want of honesty as to an instinctive feeling
that they are themselves parts of the vessel, and have
a right to anything on board of her, which the
tyranny of their commander hinders them from enjoying.
But in the case of Dennis I fear that there
was something more than this feeling, and that he
really had an unlawful hankering after other people's
goods, for he had the misfortune, not long
afterwards, to get confined in the tombs for something
or other, I never knew exactly what.</p>

<p>There is a large Roman Catholic church in the
Cove of Cork, which speaks more for the zeal than

<!-- page 49 -->

the taste or wealth of its builders. The poor people
regard it with a good deal of religious pride,
and I heard some very marvellous stories about its
erection. A man with some pretensions to intelligence
told me, that a few years ago there was an
English Admiral on the station who had a residence
on shore, in the rear of the church, and finding that
it shut out his view of the harbour, he threatened to
pull it down. The priest, hearing of his threat,
called upon the Admiral, and found him sitting in
an arm chair in his library.</p>

<p>"I have been told," said the priest "that you
have threatened to pull down our chapel, because it
interrupts your prospect."</p>

<p>"I have," replied the Admiral gruffly, "have you
anything to say against it?"</p>

<p>"I have this to say," replied, the priest, making a
mysterious sign with his finger; "sit you in that chair
until you promise to leave our chapel untouched by
your sacrilegious hand"</p>

<p>The priest looked sternly upon him, and the Admiral
attempted to rise, but could not move a finger.
He found himself fastened to his chair by some unseen
power, and he begged the priest to release
him; but the priest would not, until he had made a
vow not only to let the chapel alone, but never to
commit any act of violence against any of the children
of the holy Catholic church.</p>

<p>My informant had entire faith in this marvellous
story, and I did not offend him by seeming to doubt
it; but I was relating the circumstance to a learned
friend, a short time since, who, instead, of laughing
with me at the simplicity of the credulous Catholic,
reproved my own want of faith, and said he believed
the story himself, and began gravely to explain to
me that the priest was undoubtedly a mesmerizer,
who, instead of making a mysterious sign with his
finger, had mesmerized the Admiral by a few passes

<!-- page 50 -->

of his hand.  But I doubt whether the Catholic
himself would be willing to believe the story on such
scientific terms.</p>

<p>We remained in the Cove of Cork three weeks,
and put to sea again in good order; we cleared the
land with a fair breeze, and I was beginning to
anticipate a short passage, when the want of prudence
and good judgment, that had led to our first
disaster, very soon produced another almost as serious.</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE PASSAGE.</p>

</div>

<p>OUR captain was a rash, petulant man, without
any of the generous roughness of a sailor, but with
all his domineering and unfeeling vices. He prided
himself on his gentlemanly qualities, having been
well educated, and being the son of a rich merchant;
he had no sympathy with his crew, and
neither appreciated their efforts in times of difficulty,
nor understood or cared to alleviate their hardships.
Before leaving Cork some of the men applied to
him for money to furnish themselves with shoes and
other articles of dress, which our stay there had
rendered necessary. One man in particular, who
was very destitute, and had only one pair of thin
shoes to last him the passage home, asked for money
enough to pay for a pair of boots; but he refused
to advance a shilling for any of them. Although he
should have known that suitable clothing was as
necessary for his crew to enable them to do their
duty; as sails and rigging were for his ship. But he
not only refused to advance any money to his crew,
or provide them with proper clothing, but he neglected
to lay in any extra provisions, although the
ship had only enough on board for an ordinary passage
when she left New-York. But he neglected
nothing for his own comfort or that of his passengers,
laying in a fresh stock of provisions, sheep,
poultry, hampers of ale and soda water, and every
imaginable delicacy which the port would produce.
And he was right in doing so: but he was as regardless
of his own interests as of the welfare of the

<!-- page 52 -->

men under his command, in neglecting to furnish
food enough to last the passage.</p>

<p>Although we left the channel with a fair breeze,
in a day or two it changed to the southwest, and we
had repeated squalls, which threatened to blow our
masts away. One night the wind lulled a little, but
the sky still looked threatening, and though the
wind was dead in our teeth, the mate began to make
sail,&mdash;shaking the reefs out of the topsails, and setting
the main top-gallant sail. The men grumbled
at his folly, for they knew it would not be long before
all hands must be called to shorten sail again.
We had hardly set the top-gallant sail, when the
wind began to pipe louder and louder; but as the
mate had but just made sail, he was ashamed to
take it in again before the ropes were coiled up. The
men saw that a squall was coming, and stationed
themselves, without being ordered, at the halliards,
ready to let them run at a moment's warning. The
wind increased so rapidly that the mate was obliged
to cry out, "call all hands to shorten sail;" but before
the order could be executed, whew came the
blast out of a pile of mountainous-looking black
clouds, and the ship was on her beam ends. Crash,
crash, went the jib-boom and maintop-gallant mast;
the topsail halliards were all let go by the run; the
main tack parted, and the ship righted, but the wind
continued as fierce as ever; and what with its roaring
and screeching, the hissing of the sea, the banging
of the broken spars, the flapping of sails, and
thrashing of ropes, such a wild hubbub prevailed,
that it was impossible to hear the orders of the captain,
and we all worked at sixes and sevens on our
own responsibility. Here was another night and
another day spent in clearing away the wreck; no
rest, no refreshment, save dry salt beef and hard
bread; and, at work we went again, getting out a
new jib-boom and a new maintop-gallant mast. Before

<!-- page 53 -->

they were rigged, the wind came out fair, a
light easterly breeze, which for want of sails did us
but little good. It was ten days before we got the ship
in order again, and then we had another change of
wind, and more squalls from the northwest. Three
of our man gave out from sheer exhaustion, and
were compelled to remain below, one of them mainly
for the want of clothes, which the captain had refused
to furnish him.</p>

<p>The day after our jib-boom was rigged we had
another blow, and all hands were called again to
shorten sail. The wind was from northwest, accompanied
with hail squalls; the hail stones were
as hard as pebbles, our hands and faces were sorely
bruised with them, and it was with great difficulty
that we could cling to the yards in reefing and
furling. We were nearly four hours in getting
things snug aloft; and just as the watch was going
below, the captain thought it advisable to furl the
mainsail, and all hands were again turned up.
When we got upon the main yard the sail was stiff
with hail and ice, and not being well hauled up, it
was impossible to furl it. We tried the best we
could do, but we could do nothing: ten minutes
spent on deck in hauling the sail up, would have
enabled us to furl in as short a time. But the captain
and mate stood upon the quarter deck, sipping
hot coffee; and feeling warm and comfortable, they
amused themselves by calling us a pack of old soldiers,
and threatening to keep us there until morning
if we did not furl the sail. It was to no purpose
that we called out to them to haul up the bunt-lines
and leech-lines; they only replied to us by damning
our eyes, and calling us Mahon soldiers. We
had now been more than six hours aloft, and were
nearly exhausted; whether we should have made
out to cling much longer to the yard is doubtful.
The captain went below, and the mate then ordered

<!-- page 54 -->

us down, and told us to haul the sail up snug, which
we did, and went aloft again to furl it. The wind
had increased to a hurricane, and the waves ran
higher than I had ever seen them before. The sun
had gone down, but the sky was clear, and the foam
of the sea made it as light as noon. We mere not
long in furling the sail; but while we were on the
yard a long rolling sea, a huge mountain of brine,
broke upon deck and buried the ship completely
under water; it reared its foaming crest so high as
to wet us on the yard. Fortunately nobody was
washed overboard; but the sea carried away the
cook's galley, filled the cabin full of water, and
washed away the forecastle scuttle, so that they
were forced to nail boards on its entrance to keep
the ship from being swamped; and when we came
down upon deck, frozen, weary and hungry, we
had no place to retreat to&mdash;for such an enormity as
taking a sailor into the cabin of a liner, in the presence
of passengers, was never heard of or dreamed
of. The mate, seeing that we were like to die,
very compassionately gave each of us a gill of raw
whiskey, which I drank without winking; but I
was chilled so thoroughly that I never felt it after it
got down my throat. At another time it would
have taken me off my feet.</p>

<p>I am entirely in favour of temperance, even total
abstinence; but if I were a captain or owner of a
ship, she should never go to sea without whiskey.
Hot coffee, and hot ginger and water, are unquestionably
excellent substitutes for ardent spirits; but
there are occasions at sea when hot water cannot
be had; and some kind of stimulant is necessary, if
not to preserve life, at least to impart enough to
enable men to preserve the ship.</p>

<p>We remained on deck until midnight, when the
watch, whose turn it was to go below, went down
the fore hatch, and creeping over the coal and salt

<!-- page 55 -->

between decks, made out to knock off some boards
from the forecastle bulkhead, and get into the forecastle,
which we found knee deep in water. All
our beds and clothes were soaking wet; and instead
of sleeping, we had to go to work and bale up the
water, and hang up our clothing to dry.</p>

<p>It was now nearly a month since we left Cork,
and we had not made a third of our distance; the
wind was ahead, the weather was cold, and my
clothes were beginning to give out. I had enjoyed
capital health, had an appetite like a horse, and
slept soundly whenever I got a chance. Constant
practice had made me perfectly familiar with my
duty, and I could run about the rigging with any
man on board. Notwithstanding all our buffetings,
we had our songs and stories, and some very good
singers and romancers we had too. We now found
that our provisions were getting short, and we were
put upon a very meagre allowance of bread and
beef, although we were allowed a plenty of potatoes
and salt. But potatoes were watery food for
stomachs that had to endure the cold and toil of our
ship's deck; and many a night when I turned into
my bunk I was too hungry to sleep. Another fortnight
passed without any marked disaster, when we
encountered a gale from the southwest, compared
with which all other tornadoes were mere zephyrs.
Like all southwesters, it gave timely notice of its
approach; and had our officers been possessed of
seaman-like prudence, half its disastrous consequences
might have been avoided. We shortened
sail in good season, leaving nothing set but a close-reefed
fore and main topsail, mizzen staysail, and
fore-topmast staysail; but we neglected to put preventer
braces upon the fore and main yards, in consequence
of which the strain of the topsails sprung
the main yard, and carried away the fore yard in
the slings; we lost our new jib-boom, all three topsails

<!-- page 56 -->

and main top-gallant sail. They had all been
snugly furled, but they were blown into shreds and
ribbons. For seven or eight hours we were at the
mercy of the gale, unable to do more than secure
ourselves to the deck. It was a frightful sight to
see our ship, with her broken spars held by their
chain fastenings, and blown out upon the wind like
feathers, the ropes and sails fluttering, snapping and
cracking, flying before it, now buried between
cavernous waves, and now thrust up into the upper
world, as though she were in the power of some
malicious demon who was wreaking his vengeance
upon her in the wantonness of malice. For the
first time our captain seemed to forget his formal
consequence, and while clinging to the ring-bolts to
save his life, appeared to feel that he was in the
keeping of a power greater than himself. If he had
any such thoughts, they subsided with the storm,
for as soon as we mere able to go to work upon the
wreck, he was as petulant, as trifling, and as ill-natured
as ever. We had now to get up a new fore yard,
a new jib-boom, to fish the main yard, and
bend an entire new suit of sails, and try to make
something out of the remnants of the old ones that
were left. Here was unmitigated hard work all
night and all day; three or four of our sailors were
on the sick list, and our allowance of beef and bread
had grown so scant, that even with all the help of
potatoes and salt, we suffered from hunger. The
mates had their hot coffee every morning brought
to them as soon as the cook got a fire under his coppers,
and our chattering teeth were only set on
edge by seeing them sip it. While we mere working
upon the main yard, I chanced to cast my eyes
down the sky-light into the cabin, and saw the captain
and his passengers at their breakfast. A sheep
had been slaughtered the day before, and they had
mutton chops, fried ham, hot rolls, buckwheat cakes,

<!-- page 57 -->

omelets, tea and coffee, and boiled milk. I had
been on deck nearly the whole night, my clothes
were wet, and I had just come from my own breakfast,
which consisted of nothing more than a kid of
boiled potatoes; for while I was carrying my pot
of tea from the cook's galley to the forecastle, a little
jet of spray had leaped over the bow and fallen
plump into it and spoiled it. I could get no more.
I was very hungry, and for the first time I thought
of my former comforts; the cabin breakfast had
such a natural look, and seemed to belong to me as
a matter of right.</p>

<p>The inequalities of civilized life, where one portion
of the people are privileged to live without
work, and the other portion are doomed to work
without living, are more perceptible on ship-board
than in any other condition of life. Here are twenty
or thirty men, afloat upon the ocean, confined to
a space so small that they cannot get out of each
other's hearing, yet dwelling apart from each other
as though they belonged to different worlds, and had
no wants in common. At one end of the vessel
which contains them live ten men, who are carefully
screened from the cold and wet; their hands are
soft, their sleep undisturbed, and every good thing
which the earth, air or ocean produces is procured
for their appetites; they are the superfine of the
earth,&mdash;gods that have neither cares nor duties,&mdash;birds
in gilt cages, that are not required even to
sing in return for the lumps of white sugar that are
thrust between the wires. At the other end of the
vessel are ten other men, upon whose exertions the
lives and fortunes of the other ten depend; these
are exposed to every danger; they brave the lightning;
their faces are pelted by hail, they are soaked
in spray, they toil unceasingly, their food is
coarse and scant, their hours of rest uncertain; no
kind words are spoken to them; their wishes are

<!-- page 58 -->

never consulted, and they are beaten if they think
or dare to act contrary to the will of those whose
lives depend upon their exertions. Idlers should
be content to be idlers; they should at least allow
those who labour to enjoy an equal portion of the
fruits of their own industry.</p>

<p>Our bread and meat were reserved for dinner;
there was but little of either, and one man was appointed
to divide it into eleven equal parts, the
number of our watch; he was a natural mathematician,
and succeeded in dividing the little bits of
gristle and crumbs of bread into hexagon heaps, as
exactly of a size as the cells in a bee hive. But to
prevent anything like favouritism, after he had made
the division, we blindfolded him, and one of us pointed
to a heap and said, "Who shall have this?" "Donovan."
"Who shall have this?" "Futtuck" and
so on until the whole was disposed of. All this,
though disheartening enough, was made a subject of
merriment, and we had our songs through it all, and
laughed at our miseries. And such stories as we
had! a perfect library of romance. Every man in
the watch was a character, and had passed through
as many strange adventures as Sinbad. They were
all good fellows, without a particle of meanness in
them, and they never hung back to avoid danger, or
work, or wet. But one of our number was constitutionally
heavy; not lazy, but sanguineous; fat and
good-tempered. He wouldn't work if he could avoid
it, and liked sleeping better than anything in the
world. He must have had pleasant dreams, and no
doubt preferred them to the hard-featured realities
of his waking hours. He was not indifferent to eating,
but sleep was his pet enjoyment. Once he fell
sound asleep on the topsail yard, with a shower of
hail beating in his face. What could have tempted
such a man to go to sea I could not learn. His
name was George, a fat, heavy name; he had a

<!-- page 59 -->

broad, good-humoured, ruddy countenance, and the
richest voice for a sentimental song that ever piped
in a forecastle. Nobody disliked him, because he
was always in a good humour, and it was not easy to
think of famine with such a fat subject before you.
Sailors have sometimes been put to strange straits,
and have liked a shipmate the better for being fat.
The world is full of antagonists, and George had his
in our forecastle&mdash;a sharp, bustling, discontented,
sleepless, planning, ill-natured, hungry blue-nose
from Nova Scotia. He had once been chief mate of
a two-topsail schooner, and could never forget his
present degradation, as he seemed to consider it,
long enough to take anything easy. He was always
hunting after his knife or his tin pot, and never
failed to quarrel with the cook whenever he went to
the galley for his pot of tea. At his meals he was
sure to remember some Nova Scotia delicacy, such
as a leg of smoked mutton, or a dried halibut's fin,
that he would have had for his dinner if he had been
at home.</p>

<p>It is very strange that men who have once been
up in the world, should think it necessary to make
themselves wretched, by continually dwelling upon
their former grandeur, when they happen to fall to
a lower sphere; and yet it is natural enough. The
devils in hell would not be half so wretched if they
had not once been inhabitants of heaven. But this
is not a just analogy. The fall from innocence to
guilt can only produce unmitigated bitterness; but
such a fall as our Nova Scotian's, from smoked
mutton to salt and potatoes, ought not to rumple the
pin-feathers of an independent mortal. Another
man might have grumbled over a dried halibut's fin,
although such a delicacy would have filled up the
measure of our grumbler's content. The best way
is to grumble at nothing, and make the best of what

<!-- page 60 -->

we can get, even though it may not be the fill of our
desires.</p>

<p>The remainder of our crew were very good
sailors, and were always ready to perform their
duty, when they were not prevented by illness, else
we should have had a more terrible time of it.
Every nation in Europe was represented in our
forecastle; there were two Swedes, one Dane, one
Norwegian, three Scotch, one Irish, one Prussian,
one Pole, one Frenchman, one Welshman, one
Hanoverian, six English, one American, myself, and
two English boys. Not a soul of them had been
naturalized, even; and yet our laws say that none
but American citizens shall serve as sailors on board
of our ships. But such laws are made to be broken.
How absurd it would be to pass a law to prevent
any but American citizens serving as waiters in our
hotels, or to hinder foreigners from carrying the
hod, or digging our canals. But such a law would
not be a jot more absurd than that which is meant
to keep foreigners out of our ships. Indeed it would
not be half so absurd; for we have one law that says
that none but American citizens shall serve on board
our ships, and another that virtually excludes them
from such employment. We have hardly a statute
in our books that is not contradicted by another, but
none so absurdly as the laws for creating the materials
for a navy. The one ruling motive with Americans
in adopting a profession, is the hope of preferment,
and where that is denied to them, they
cannot be enticed to enter. Our laws, therefore, by
denying preferment to the seamen of our navy, let
their merits be what they may, deprive Americans
of every honourable inducement to serve their country
as sailors, and even make the badge of the navy
a disgrace to those who wear it. For nothing can
be more disgraceful to an honest American, than to
accept of a situation where promotion is denied to

<!-- page 61 -->

him.  The poorest boy in the nation may aspire to
the highest office in the gift of his countrymen; but
if he should enter the navy as a sailor, though he had
the spirit of a Decatur, he could never rise a single
step beyond the degraded condition of a serving
man. The effect of a regulation like this could be
easily foreseen, and it was foreseen by the time-serving
place-hunters who framed it, who knew that
no American, unless he were degraded by vice,
would ever enter a national ship, and, therefore to
compel Americans to do so, they framed a law, declaring
that none but American citizens should
navigate either our national or merchant vessels.
And were any attempt made to enforce this law, our
ships would rot at our wharves and navy-yards.
There should be no more disgrace in serving as a
sailor on board our war ships, than in serving as a
clerk in the War Department at Washington; and
there would not be, if the line of promotion in our
naval service were thrown open to the deserving.
In what manner, or by whose ill-judgment the
ridiculously aristocratic regulations of our naval
service were imposed upon the nation, I know not;
but a more efficient plan for destroying that arm of
our national defence, could not have been devised
by our bitterest enemy. The navy of no nation in
the world is so hampered and enervated by such
exclusive and aristocratic regulations as ours.</p>

<p>It may be asked, in what manner are the laws
regarding sailors evaded? Nothing is more easy.
Two thirds of the sailors in our ships perjure themselves;
and so lightly are such false oaths regarded,
that they are among sailors a common subject for
mirth; and certificates of citizenship are bartered
for knives or plugs of tobacco.</p>

<p>There is but one way in which American seamen
can be made, and that is by throwing open the line
of promotion in the navy. As long as the officers

<!-- page 62 -->

in the service are selected from the sons of political
favourites, without regard to their fitness, our national
and merchant vessels will continue to be manned
by the drippings of European navies; and if
war should ever again call for a naval force, we
should have to begin at the beginning, and create
sailors, the same as though we had not spent hundreds
of millions to maintain a navy in time of profound
peace.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

</div>

<p>WHILE we were engaged in repairing the damages
of the last gale, we were tantalised by another
haul of easterly wind, which died away before we
got in a condition to use it. We had kept well to
the northward, anticipating a prevalence of northerly
winds; but our hardest gales had been from
the southwest, which had driven us into such a high
latitude that the cold was very severe, and our decks
were all the time covered with hail. Our ship was
a fast sailer and a good sea-boat; but being deeply
laden with a dead cargo, she laboured heavily, and
when there was much wind, the sea made a continual
breach across her bows, so that when we had, by
any lucky chance, kept our clothes dry for a whole
watch, we usually got well soaked in attempting to
go below. Yet, notwithstanding that we were literally
under water more than half our time, we were compelled
to wash the ship's deck every morning at
daybreak, without any regard to the weather, if we
could stand on our feet long enough to carry a
bucket of water to the mate, who would dash it
upon the deck with a perfectly grave face, although
at the time the sea would be making a breach over
us. But it is the universal custom at sea to wash
down a ship's decks at daylight, whether it be necessary
or not.</p>

<p>We had laboured under a great disadvantage in
making our last repairs, from having lost our carpenter
a few days before the last gale. As the
cause of his death was peculiar, it will require some
remarks before I relate it.</p>

<p>A ship's deck is an absolute monarchy, where the

<!-- page 64 -->

chief officer holds unchecked sway over the lives
and pleasures of his people. There are no constitutional
balances at sea. The captain can do no wrong.
The laws of the deck are made for the protection
of the king, who, having absolute command, needs
no protection; his orders must be obeyed without
thought; to question them is mutiny; his humours
must be regarded as divine wisdom; his tyranny is
only discipline. Right or wrong, his word is a law
that cannot be broken with impunity. If from
weakness or meekness he allows the transgressor
to escape, the law seizes him and punishes him
ashore. If a sailor raise his hand in self-defence
against his superior in command, 'tis mutiny; if he
is starved, he is not allowed the privilege of complaint;
if he is overworked, he can claim no extra
pay, if he refuse to work, his pay is stopped. He
may be ordered aloft at the peril of his life, ay,
where death would be certain, to save a bit of rope
not worth a shilling; and if he refuse to go, he can
be put in irons and tried for a capital offence. The
authority of a ship-master, like that of a slave-owner,
is too great not to be abused. It is not in human
nature to resist the temptation to tyranny that our
law holds out to ship-masters. Men cannot help
holding in contempt those over whom they exercise
unlimited control. The prerogatives of tyranny
smother all kindly feelings in the human breast, and
therefore they should in all cases be forbidden by law,
and not established as they are in the case of a sea-commander.
There is nothing in the relation of a
ship-captain to his crew, which requires such a wide
distinction as the law makes between them. A sailor
has the same instinctive feelings of self-preservation
which other men have, which would lead him
to obey his commander in times of difficulty, and
which should allow him the privilege of expostulation,
when he sees his superior is unfit to command.

<!-- page 65 -->

There is no better reason for giving the master of
a ship unlimited power over his crew, than there is
for giving the same authority to a mechanic over his
apprentices or journeymen.</p>

<p>The great error of our naval discipline is its being
adopted from the British service, in which it is perfectly
consistent with the other departments of the
government; with us it is a monstrous anomaly, a
foul blot upon our free system of laws. In truth,
our marine is governed by a code greatly inferior to
that of England; for while she has made many
improvements, we have stood still. Merit may do
something towards promoting a man in any European
naval service; but in ours, the most worthless
poltroon, whose friends possess political influence
sufficient to gain him an appointment in our navy,
rises side by side to pay and station, with the brightest,
and best spirits in the service. No government
in Europe is half so exclusive, so tyrannical, so aristocratic
in regard to its subjects who act as its defenders,
as ours to its citizens. A Nelson, a Decatur,
might serve in our navy until he was gray, and
never be rewarded with promotion.</p>

<p>The strange darkness of the public mind in regard
to this matter has recently been sadly developed
in the case of the horrible murders committed on
board the Somers. View that terrible transaction
as you may, with all the apologies of the main actor
in the unparalleled tragedy before you, and it must
be accounted a cowardly murder. I am exceedingly
unwilling to allude to a subject which must be
alike painful to the friends of the unhappy victims
of our tyrannical laws, and to those of the ill-judging
officers who acted as their executioners. But
the subject is one of too great importance to allow
it to be passed by, when it will serve to illustrate
the evils which the people can only remove by being
made acquainted with them.</p>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>We have been maintaining a naval force for nearly
thirty years, at an expense to the industry of the
nation exceeding two hundred millions of dollars;
and all the glory that we have earned in return has
been the capture of two feeble towns,* whose inhabitants
had done us no wrong, and for which we were
compelled to make apologies, and court-martial the
captors; and the murder, in cool blood, of three unarmed
men, who were hung at the yard-arm of a
national ship, without even being tried, or informed
of their offence. It is the foulest, darkest, bloodiest
spot upon our national history. Although perpetrated
by one or two individuals, it is a national
offence, because it was the legitimate result of our
national LAW; and because the deed itself has been
approved by the public voice. It was the inevitable
effect of a system, miscalled of defence, which has
reared in the midst of our boasted, democracy, an
absurd aristocracy, at variance with our beautiful
system, which, beyond all other human governments,
helps to restore humanity to its rights. The wisdom
of Washington is misinterpreted by us. In time of
peace prepare for war, is a caution to avoid war by
practising the arts of peace, and not to hasten it on
by arming ships and fortifications, and thus creating a
war-spirit in our bosoms when we have not an enemy
in the world, and all the world is in profound peace.
The true watch-word of the nation is, <i>in time of war
prepare for peace</i>. No man thinks of going into the
street with a sword in his hand, lest an enemy should
attack him, when he knows of no enemy. Why then
should a nation keep itself in a state of warlike
defence, when no one attempts to make an aggression?</p>

<p class="small">[*The capture of Foxardo by Com. Porter, and of Monterey
by Captain Jones.]</p>

<p>The unequaled outrage committed on board the

<!-- page 67 -->

Somers, should have opened the eyes of our people
to the enormous wrongs that they were nursing in
their navy; but the leaven of aristocracy which was
left in our laws at the time of our dissolution with
England, has not yet worked out, and the fresh supplies
which we continue to receive from her in our
daily reading, must account for the unnatural verdict
of the public mind in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>With a kind of bitter irony, but not less severe
for that, the inhabitants of Boston or Philadelphia,
I forget which city has a right to this honour, bestowed
upon the cowardly actor in that dreadful tragedy,
a sword. A SWORD! What should he do with a
sword? In judging of a case like the inhuman massacre
on board the Somers, we might safely trust to
the verdict of British officers, without any fear of
leaning on the side of mercy. But the voice of the
British navy, speaking through its acknowledged
organs, pronounces the act one of the most dastardly
and inhuman that has ever been perpetrated upon
the ocean.</p>

<p>Men who live on shore, see a mist whenever they
look out to sea. Everything with them suffers a sea
change. Mariners are a strange kind of monsters
to them; with unnatural proportions and distorted
passions; they live at sea, out of the pale of the
sweet charities which encompass them on shore;
they are laughed at and wondered at as odd fish,
and are not sympathized with as men possessing
human feelings, and subject to suffering from the
wrongs which oppress other men.</p>

<p>The chief mate of our ship was a model quarter-deck
tyrant; too much of a man to be despised,
and too bad a one to be respected. He had all the
elements of a tyrant in him; he was courageous, revengeful,
and capricious; sufficiently kind to his
favourites to make it desirable to gain his good will.
Towards some of us in the forecastle he manifested

<!-- page 68 -->

a fondness almost parental, bringing us dry stockings,
plugs of tobacco, and sly drinks of whiskey.
Sometimes he would even take off his jacket and
throw it to some of the men who looked cold; while
he would refuse others a patch of canvass to mend
a tattered sou'wester. Towards me has evinced a
partiality which added nothing to my comfort, for it
made me an object of suspicion with my companions
in the forecastle, upon whom I was more dependent
than upon the officers. The friendship of a tyrant is
always dangerous. Sometimes he would call me aft,
and under a pretense of keeping me at work, he
would make me stand inside the hurricane house
during a whole watch, to keep me out of the wet.</p>

<p>Our second mate was an amiable young man, ambitious
of getting ahead, and a good sailor enough
for one of his age. But the mate treated him worse
than a dog, and I saw him sometimes shed tears
when the mate "blew him up," as he called his
abuse. Every mishap that occurred on board the ship
was attributed to the unfortunate second mate, who
was rarely called by any other name than a Mahon
soldier. "Don't fall, dummy," the mate would call
out to him when he was aloft, in a sneering voice.
Every epithet of contempt that he could invent was
bestowed by the mate upon the unfortunate second
dickey, until the poor fellow was harassed within an
inch of his life. And yet, to have spoken or acted
in his own defence would have been mutiny. The
mate would not strike any body, because he had
suffered in the Marine Court for doing so. Flogging
a sailor at sea on board a merchant vessel, is an
expensive amusement; but any other cruelty or abuse
may be practised with impunity.</p>

<p>Our carpenter was another of the mate's buts.
He was a Norwegian, a huge titanesque creature,
who might have personated the god Woden, or any
other of the beer-drinking heroes of the Northern

<!-- page 69 -->

mythology, He towered up above our heads with
his broad scowling face, like a being of a different
race. He was an old man, past sixty-five, and all
his life had been spent at sea. It is inconceivable
that a man could have lived so long upon the earth,
and should know so little about it. A green leaf
was as great a novelty to him as it was to Noah's
dove. The greater part of his life had been spent
on board of a Swedish frigate, where he had acquired
a habit of obedience rarely found in an Englishman
or an American. His shoulders were of
immense breadth, but not an inch too broad for his
ponderous head, which was but scantily provided
with hair, that looked like steel wires. His face was
brown, like a piece of old mahogany; and a scar on
his right cheek, and another that divided his under
lip on the left side, gave it a singular appearance of
ferocity. His nose was enormous, full of holes, and
in colour resembling a bunch of Isabella grapes,
looking as if it had been used as a target by a rifle
company; his eyes, which were a greenish blue,
were shaded by a pair of heavy black eyebrows, as
shaggy and hard looking as the dwarf cedars that
frown upon the brow of a stony hill which I look
upon from my window as I sit and write. These
were very far from the elements of beauty, certainly;
but grouped as they were on the person of old
Derrick, they created an impression by no means
unpleasant. He was mainly good-natured, but uncontrollable
when excited to passion by an affront,
and therefore we in the forecastle all took good care
not to offend him: a blow from his fist was not a
thing one would be likely to forget in a hurry. He
would have been a most amusing companion, if it
had been possible to understand him, for his wild
northern stories were just the kind of amusement
fitted to our stormy watches, but the scar in his
lip, and his barbarous tongue together, made his attempts

<!-- page 70 -->

at English the most incomprehensible jargon
that was ever uttered. He could understand
the orders given him, and he always executed them
faithfully, but we had to guess at his meaning whenever
he spoke. The mate took a fancy to torment
the carpenter, not from spite or malice, but from
the pure wantonness of tyranny: for no other reason
than that he had the power to do so. He used to
call Derrick leather-lips, instead of carpenter, which
vexed the soul of the old man the more because his
habit of duty would not allow him to make any reply,
even though his imperfect speech would have
allowed him to do so.</p>

<p>"What now, leather-lips?" the mate would say,
when the carpenter stepped upon the quarter-deck;
at which the old man would knit his shaggy brows,
and stride back to the forecastle, venting his terrible
northern curses, and gnashing his teeth horribly.
Sometimes he would be so vexed at the mate's
jokes, that he would not eat a mouthful for two or
three days. Instead of getting used to the mate's
banter, the old man grew more and more irritable,
and, his paroxysms of passion became more frightful.
He would sit upon his tool-chest, and mutter
something after this fashion: "Fut te tyvil in hell!
fut leffer-lips; I fill kill myself; I fill kill myself and
go to hell fit him. Fut te tyvil ist to leffer-lips. I
fill be tammed fit hell fit him."</p>

<p>Thus the old Norwegian giant would sit and
threaten; and the mate, so far from being moved
to pity by his unhappy petulance, would only laugh
at him, and say, "Go it while you're young, leather-lips."
He at last grew so petulant and wrathful
from the continued banter of the mate, that no one
in the forecastle dared to speak to him. One night
after a day of unusual fatigue, the old man came
down into the forecastle, and struck the lid of his
chest with his clenched fist, and swore a tremendous

<!-- page 71 -->

oath, that the next time the mate called him by that
hated name he would jump overboard and drown
himself. His old eyes flashed fire as he spoke, and
I was fearful that he would be as good as his word.
During the night we had a very heavy blow from
the southeast, but towards morning it died away,
and by sunrise it was nearly calm, but as there was
a little air, all hands were turned up to make sail;
and while we were mast-heading the topsails, old
Derrick came upon deck, and the mate called
out, "Come aft here, leather-lips, and give us a
pull."</p>

<p>The old man instantly pulled off his cap and
jumped upon the railing forward of the main rigging,
and standing erect, shook his fist at the
mate.</p>

<p>"Get down, you old fool, or you will fall overboard,"
cried the mate. Derrick made no reply,
but glared fiercely upon us, and leaped into the
sea. The act was so sudden that we were all paralyzed
for a moment and the mate turned as pale as
death, and trembled violently. We immediately
threw overboard all the loose articles about deck,
and in five minutes the stern boat was in the water.
But the old man had disappeared for ever. It was
nearly calm; and although there was a very heavy
swell, we could have saved him, but it seemed that
he had purposely held his head under water. The
mate tried to make light of the matter, and said the
old man was crazy; but it was very evident that he
felt himself encumbered by the weight of a murdered
fellow being.</p>

<p>The old man was a great annoyance to us the remainder
of the voyage, for hardly a night passed
that some of the crew did not fancy they either saw
him or heard him; they always had called him a
Fin, and they believed he had power to raise or allay
the wind at his pleasure; and every unusual

<!-- page 72 -->

gale we experienced the rest of the passage, they
would say, "Old Derrick is giving it to us again."
Although it was known that he had a case bottle of
schnapps in his chest, not a soul had the courage to
touch it, fearing that he would appear to them if
they did.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

</div>

<p>A CELEBRATED naval commander has said that
mere courage is not sufficient for a sailor; he must
be "fool-hardy;" but he must be more than this&mdash;an
unconsciousness of hardship and peril will not do;
he must love danger for its own sake, or he can be
no genuine sailor. There are no inducements held
out to sailors to make them in love with their fool-hardy
business, but on the contrary, all the discouragements
that would keep men from other employments.
Owners and masters of ships understand
perfectly well that sailors go to sea for pure enjoyment,
and not for gain, and therefore they give them
for their invaluable services the smallest pittance
possible for them to subsist upon. A hod carrier is
magnificently rewarded, compared with a sailor; a
chambermaid, whose heaviest duty is in shaking up
a bed, receives nearly the same wages as a foremast
hand in our packet service. It is very clear that
sailors do not go to sea for the sake of what they get,
but from some other motive, which none but a sailor
can comprehend. There may be some inquisitive
spirits who go to sea for the sake of what they can
see; but there are but few such. The genuine
sailor is a reckless, daring spirit, whose hell is quiet.
He must have strong and powerful excitements, such
as only dallying with death produces. Generally he
is as indifferent as the vessel he floats in about the
length of his voyage or the port of its termination;
the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Finland are the
same to him.</p>

<p>On board of our ship there was a sailor who never
discovered, until we were out of the channel, that

<!-- page 74 -->

we were bound to New-York instead of New-Orleans;
he having shipped, in a vessel bound to the
latter port. And when he discovered his mistake,
he said less about it than an omnibus traveller would
at being carried a block out of his way.  One of our
crew told me of a strange incident in his life, occasioned
by this carelessness of destination. He left
his native place in a brig bound to Havana, and after
his arrival in that port deserted his ship and went on
board of a slaver bound for the coast of Africa,
probably enticed by the peril of the employment,
and with the hope of being hung for a pirate. The
brig in which he had left home returned in due time,
and when in sight of port was wrecked, and every
soul on board perished. When the wreck was discovered,
the friends of her crew took measures to
recover the bodies of their relations; and among the
rest, the father and brothers of the young sailor who
had been left behind, never having heard of his desertion,
and supposing him drowned, as a matter of
course, were at great pains to discover his body. A
corpse was found upon the beach which they thought
was his; it was much defaced, but they had no doubt
of its identity, and therefore bestowed upon it
due funeral rites, and erected a marble stone over it in
the village burying ground, with an inscription
bearing as little truth, perhaps, as ever a tomb-stone
bore. The runaway was drifted about upon the
ocean two or three years, when, having been paid
off in Boston with money enough to buy a new suit
of clothes, he determined to go home and see his
mother. It was dusk when he reached his father's
door, and entering without ceremony, he found the
family seated at supper. The tumult and confusion
which followed his sudden appearance among them
must be left to the reader's imagination. The next
morning his father took him to the burying ground
and showed him the stone that had been erected to

<!-- page 75 -->

his memory, and he enjoyed the pleasure, which has
probably fallen to the lot of but few mortals, of reading
his own epitaph; he told me there were some
first rate lines on his tomb-stone, but he had forgotten
them.</p>

<p>Sailors generally come from the country; the
majority of them have worked on a farm. Town-bred
youths are too effeminate for the sea; they
have too many recollections of the delicacies and
amusements of a city life to "scorn delights and
live laborious days."</p>

<p>One of our crew was a young Englishman, who had
the chivalrous disposition of a knight-errant; placed
in a higher sphere, he would have been acknowledged
the flower of gallantry. His name was Macartney;
he told me that his brother was a major
in the service of the East India Company, and that
his aunt was the wife of an earl. His father was
killed at the battle of Waterloo. But Jack required
no extraneous honours; he was an honest fellow,
and a brave-hearted gentleman&mdash;who might have
lived ashore in ease, but he delighted in the dangers
and hardships of a sea life. When our provisions
were getting short, and it required the soul of a philosopher
to resist the temptation of cutting a larger
slice of beef than fell to your share, Jack would
never help himself until every man in the watch had
had his cut. On one occasion, when we had been
kept from our dinner by some unnecessary work
which the mate had put upon us for the sake of
"working up" somebody whom he had taken a dislike
to, on going down into the forecastle, we found
the kids which contained our beef and pudding
(duff, as the sailors call it,) capsized, and the contents
rolling in the lee scuppers, cold and dirty.
Everybody began to grumble at the bad treatment
we received, and to complain of our cold dinner.
But Jack sat looking on in silence, until he

<!-- page 76 -->

saw one of the watch make a motion to cut a piece
of the beef.</p>

<p>"Avast there!" said Jack; "are you going to
sit there, like dogs in a kennel, and growl and eat
whatever your master throws at you? Take your
kids and go aft to the captain and tell him you will
not be fed like dogs." But nobody moved.</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'll go myself," he said; and
taking the kids in his hands he carried them on to
the quarter-deck, where the captain was walking
with his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said the captain, sternly.</p>

<p>"I want to be treated like a man, and not like a
brute," said Jack; "see what has been served up
to us for our dinner; haven't we done our duty, and
more than our duty?"</p>

<p>"Go forward, you mutinous rascal," said the captain,
"or I will put you in irons."</p>

<p>"It will not be safe for you to attempt it," said
Jack. "But you are no gentleman, or you would
not talk to me in that manner."</p>

<p>The captain grew livid with rage, and called for
his pistols, which were immediately handed to him
by the steward.</p>

<p>"Poo! poo!" said Jack "you are a cowardly
wretch. I won't make a disturbance by taking hold
of you, but I'll thrash you as soon as we reach New-York.
We won't eat your dirty beef;" and so saying,
he threw the two kids overboard, and walked
forward.</p>

<p>"What! have you thrown our grub overboard.?"
muttered one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, "I have; and if a soul of you
grumbles at it, I'll flog him."</p>

<p>So we ate dry bread for our dinner that day. It
was not long afterwards that the captain and his passengers
lost their dinner, but didn't manifest much
heroism under their disappointment.</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<div class="center" id="wp08">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

</div>

<p>AMONG the luxuries which the captain had provided
for himself and passengers was a fine green
turtle, which was not likely to suffer from exposure
to salt water, so it was reserved, until all the pigs,
and sheep, and poultry had been eaten. A few
days before we arrived, it was determined to kill
the turtle and have a feast the next day. Our cabin
gentlemen had been long enough deprived of fresh
meats to make them cast lickerish glances towards
their hard-skinned friend, and there was a great
smacking of lips the day before he was killed. As
I walked aft occasionally I heard them congratulating
themselves on their prospective turtle soup and
force-meat balls; and one of them, to heighten the
luxury of the feast, ate nothing but a dry biscuit for
twenty-four hours, that he might be able to devour
his full share of the unctuous compound. It was to
be a gala day with them; and though it was not
champagne day, that falling on Saturday and this on
Friday, they agreed to have champagne a day in
advance, that nothing should be wanting to give a
finish to their turtle. It happened to be a rougher
day than usual when the turtle was cooked, but they
had become too well used to the motion of the ship
to mind that. It chanced to be my turn at the wheel
the hour before dinner, and I had the tantalizing misery
of hearing them laughing and talking about their
turtle, while I was hungry from want of dry bread
and salt meat. I had resolutely kept my thoughts
from the cabin during all the passage but once, and
now I found my ideas clustering round a tureen of
imaginary turtle in spite of all my philosophy.  Confound

<!-- page 78 -->

them, if they had gone out of my hearing with
their exulting smacks, I would not have envied their
soup; but their hungry glee so excited my imagination,
that I could see nothing through the glazing of
the binnacle but a white plate with a slice of lemon on
the rim, a loaf of delicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin,
two or three wine glasses of different hues and
shapes, and a stream of black, thick, and fragrant
soup pouring into the plate. By and by it was four
bells; they dined at six. And all the gentlemen,
with the captain at their head, darted below into
the cabin, where their mirth increased when they
caught sight of the soup plates. "Hurry with the
soup, steward," roared the captain. "Coming, sir,"
replied the steward. The cook opened the door of
his galley, and out came the delicious steam of the
turtle, such as people often inhale, and step across
the street of a hot afternoon to avoid, as they pass
by Delmonico's in South William-street. Then came
the steward with a large covered tureen in his hand,
toward the cabin gangway. I forgot the ship for a
moment in looking at this precious cargo, the wheel
slipped from my hands, the ship broached to with a
sudden jerk; the steward had got only one foot upon
the stairs, when this unexpected motion threw him off
his balance, and down he went by the run; the tureen
slipped from his hands, and part of its contents flew
into the lee scuppers, and the balance followed him
in his fall.</p>

<p>I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand
times more than I should have done if I had
eaten the whole of it. But I was forced to restrain
my mirth, for the next moment the steward ran upon
deck, followed by the captain, in a furious rage, threatening
if he caught him to throw him overboard. Not
a spoonful of the soup had been left in the coppers,
for the steward had taken it all away at once to keep
it warm. In about an hour afterwards the passengers

<!-- page 79 -->

came upon deck, looking more sober than I
had seen them since we left Liverpool. They had
dined upon cold ham.</p>

<p>On the first of March we got soundings on St.
George's bank. Cold as it was before, the weather
now grew colder. Hail was changed to snow, and
our ship's decks were covered with ice; all the tacks
and sheets were frozen stiff, and we were forced to
keep away to the south to thaw out, for if we had
been struck by a squall it would have been impossible
to shorten sail. Before we could square our
yards we had to pour hot water upon the tacks, to
render them pliable enough to start them. It was
so extremely difficult to work the ship, in consequence
of the ice upon the running rigging, and the
wind was so fresh, for we were under close-reefed
topsails, that it was considered prudent to clue up
the foresail while we were wearing ship, lest it
should blow away; and it being discovered that one
of the clue-garnets was stranded, I was sent aloft to
secure it. I was chilled to the midriff before leaving
the deck, and I had not been aloft many minutes
before I began to feel benumbed and drowsy, and
perceiving that I had lost the power of sustaining
myself, I grasped my arms around the forward
swifter, (one of the shrouds of the foremast,) and
contrived to drop upon deck without injuring myself.
How I did it I do not know, and, at the time I did not
care, for I was past feeling, and I remember that I
had half a mind to drop myself overboard. I lost
all consciousness as soon as I struck the deck, and
being taken below, they poured some hot brandy and
water down my throat, and in an hour or two I revived
and went to my duty on deck. This was the only
time during the passage that I was off duty an hour.</p>

<p>After standing to the southward twenty-four hours
the weather moderated, and a warm sun gave us all
new life. In another fortnight we passed Sandy

<!-- page 80 -->

Hook, that seemed to welcome me back to my
home. It was the last object I had seen on leaving
it, and it was the first to greet me on my return.
How unchanged did the long sandy point look with
its few scrubby trees and its faithful beacon&mdash;but
how changed was I!</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>WELL. I had not made a profitless trip to Europe,
although it had ended very differently from
what I had anticipated when I set out. I had learned
how to rough it with the world, and with the elements,&mdash;a
lesson that I sadly needed. I had preserved
my independence and my integrity, and I
had improved my health. I had missed seeing the
picture galleries of Italy, but I had found something
vastly better. I fear that few who go to Europe for
improvement, return home with so valuable a stock
of experience.</p>

<p>Spite of the hardships I had endured on board the
&mdash;&mdash;, I left her with a feeling of regret; and I
could scarce part with my forecastle companions
without a tear for the loss of their fellowship. Suffering
has a more potent influence in binding men
to each other than pleasure.</p>

<p>But the feeling of regret at parting with my shipmates
was but slight, compared with my ardent desires
to see my friends; and I jumped ashore as
soon as the ship struck the dock, proud of my hard
hands and weather-beaten appearance, because I
could return to my mother without the incumbrance
of debt, and better prepared to bear the burden
which my loss had imposed upon me, than I was
when I left her.</p>

<p>My little narrative is at an end. It is too common-place,
I am aware, to deserve notice for its
events, since it relates nothing which has not been

<!-- page 81 -->

related before; but the moral of it is worth having,
if the reader can pick it out&mdash;if he cannot, it would
be idle to do it for him.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, young traveller, when you pine
after luxuries that do not happen to be within your
reach, that it is possible to endure hard labour and
be happy with no other refreshments than potatoes
and salt, provided they are honestly earned.</p>

<p class="small">PRELUDIAL: IN WHICH THE READER WILL BE VERY LIKELY TO DISCOVER SOME OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS
PUT INTO PRINT.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN a man suddenly thrusts himself before the world, it is meet
and proper that he should give some account of himself, as well as
an intimation of the objects he has in view in stepping boldly out
from the rank and file of his fellow-creatures, to challenge their attention.
In conformity, therefore, with what I conceive to be so just
and proper, I beg leave, most gentle reader, to introduce myself to
you, and also to make some explanation of my motives in obtruding
myself upon your consideration.</p>

<p>Know, then, that I am one of those unhappy creatures, whom the
fates have appointed to labor for the benefit, not only of their own
immediate contemporaries, but also of posterity, with the almost
certain prospect of receiving nothing in return, but the reflections,
pleasurable or otherwise, to which the subject may give birth. That
there should be such a race of individuals, may appear somewhat
marvellous to the thoughtless; but even they cannot deny the fact;
neither should it be an object of especial wonder to them, seeing that
themselves are a proof, that it takes all sorts of people to make up
a world. That men should volunteer to serve the living public, is
not indeed a cause for such monstrous surprise; but that they should
volunteer to sweat and toil for posterity, may well cause wonder,
even in the thoughtful; since, from the very nature of the case, as
an ingenious philosopher has somewhere hinted, posterity can have
laid them under no possible obligation, neither can it, by any possibility,
reward them, were it so disposed. But so it is. And with my
eyes wide open to the folly and inconsistency of such a course, I
must go on and fulfil the object of my being, whether I be so inclined
or not.</p>

<p>That a man should ever take up his pen, with the avowed purpose
of using it for the world's benefit, dipping it, as it were, in the sweat
of his own brain, with the knowledge that that very world will never
thank him for his pains, is indeed surprising. Better were it, that
he should take a sword in hand, for men are paid good fat salaries, and
have rations of bread and meal allowed them, for keeping themselves
in readiness to slaughter their fellow-creatures, when called upon to
do so; nay, they are educated at the public expense for this very
purpose; they are afterward complimented with costly presents by
the country, and honored with an apothe&ouml;sis at their death. Scarcely
a legislative season passes by, in which the people's representatives
do not vote a gold-hilted sword to some one of those men who have
attained a Niles' Register immortality, by slaying with their own hands
more or less of their fellow beings. But when did a legislature vote
even a steel pen to a patriotic author, who, having educated himself
at his own expense, and given up the profitable occupations open before
him, has devoted his precious days and nights to writing for the
benefit of his country; creating employment to hundreds, nay thousands,
of artizans; putting steam-presses and paper-mills in motion;

<!-- vol 14 page 149 -->

solacing the minds of the mature, and elevating the morals of the
young; gaining a name for his country, and making her known among
the nations, by the products of his pen; and enriching and benefitting
every body but himself? How many such men have lived and
died among us, of whom the people, by their representatives, never
so much as acknowledged the existence, even while they were enjoying
the liberal bounties of their genius; while never yet was there a
Major Marrowfat, who, having been put into the army by his parents,
because they were either too poor or too indolent to provide for him
themselves, and finding himself marching toward a hostile army, on
some pleasant day, and seeing retreat impossible, has shut up both
eyes, and in very desperation has cut and slashed at the men before
him, until his sword has wept human blood; and having, by some
lucky chance, escaped unhurt, or perhaps with a slight scar on one
of his fat cheeks, did not immediately become a pet of the people;
towns and counties are called after him; his portrait is painted at
the expense of the state; his pay is increased; he is elevated in
rank; and he never exerts himself again, except to spend his pay,
and eat his rations, and he is a hero! True, our blessed country
does but imitate other christian nations in this respect, to a certain
extent; yet it must be borne in mind, that England grants pensions
to men-preservers, as well as to men-destroyers; for among the numerous
marble effigies which decorate the interior of Saint Paul's cathedral,
there are two, erected at the expense of the nation, to the
memory of men who labored more assiduously to benefit their fellow-creatures,
than ever did colonel, captain, commodore, or admiral, to
destroy them. These are the philanthropist Howard, and the no
less philanthropist, Johnson. And France, too, the bare mention of
whose name calls up images of blood and carnage, and hosts of
armed men, even fighting France, has never been unmindful of her
sons who wielded the pen. The bourgeois of Toulouse, even in a
warlike age, if my memory does not deceive me, presented a massive
silver Minerva to the poet Rousard, as a testimonial of their
respect for his talents. Let me put it now to the honorables, the
representatives of this mighty people, if they do not esteem such a
man, for example, as the author of the Life of Columbus, quite as
much entitled to a trifling compliment, as though it could be proved,
on the testimony of credible witnesses, that he had killed a white
man, or even an Indian, at the battle of Madakelchamp, or some
equally renowned field of blood?</p>

<p>But, gentle reader, I did not observe that you were standing all
this time, with your hat in your hand, waiting for an introduction.
Doubtless you have by this received sufficient insight into my character,
to satisfy your curiosity. So I will say not another word
about myself, but proceed immediately to lay before you the plans
and principles by which I shall be guided, in the preparation of these
forth-coming Gimcrackeries.</p>

<p>In the first place, the author will honestly confess, that he has been
mainly induced to the preparation of these papers, by a desire for immortality;
and the Editor of 'OLD KNICK.' having, in the most generous
manner, undertaken to embalm the creations of his fancy in his
time-defying pages, he will henceforth be easy on that score; looking
upon himself as already handed down to posterity; consequently, his

<!-- vol 14 page 150 -->

mind being at rest, and his affairs prosperous, he can devote himself to
his undertaking, with undivided energies.</p>

<p>The principles by which he will be guided, are those of universal
benevolence; but within their extended circumference are innumerable
considerations, neither possible nor profitable to enumerate.
But as it is infinitely easier, as must have been discovered some time
since, for a man to promise what he will not do, than to promise what
he will, I shall therefore let the reader draw his own conclusions as
to what he may expect, from that which I shall caution him not to
expect, in the future Gimcrackeries that will be presented to his notice.</p>

<p>FIRST. He must not expect any translations from, nor imitations
of, any of the high Germanorum mystery-mongers, now in vogue
among fashionable authors and scholars; for, Doctor Channing to the
contrary notwithstanding, I am willing to undertake to prove, in the
teeth of all the smoke-dried professors of Heidelburgh and Harvard,
that a feeble thought can gain no strength from being smothered
under heap of dictionary words; and that truth can never be made
truer, by being surrounded with ever so many mysterious-looking
falsehoods.</p>

<p>SECONDLY. He must not expect any quotations from Latin or
Greek authors; from 'Old Play,' nor from the British classics; for,
taking it for granted that he is quite as well read in the Dictionary of
Quotations, and the 'Elegant Extracts,' as myself, I should consider it
a work of supererogation to place any of the dainties contained in
those erudite works before him.</p>

<p>THIRDLY. He must not look for any learned dissertations on any
subject whatever; such, for instance, as the probable number of
old men of which the chorus in a tragedy of &AElig;schylus may have
been composed; as I consider it a matter of very little moment to
the present, or any other generation, whether there were fifteen or
twelve, or indeed whether there were any at all.</p>

<p>FOURTHLY. He must not expect one syllable about the Subtreasury,
the Presidential question, Lady Bulwer, nor any other fashionable
subject.</p>

<p>FIFTHLY. He must not expect that I shall, in conformity with
the advice of one the countless multitude of modern authors, put
forth my strongest thoughts first; as that would be manifestly contrary
to all precedent, and in violation of Nature herself, whom I am
anxious to propitiate, by striving to follow her dictates. Buds and
blossoms before fruits and flowers, is her universal prescription.
And in elegant society, we all know that '<i>Potage &agrave; la Julienne</i>' invariably
precedes '<i>Bas grill&eacute;e au ma&icirc;tre d' Hotel</i>,' or a '<i>Fricandeau de
Veau</i>.'</p>

<p>Therefore, O reader! peruse this Gimcrack in the same pleasant
temper with which you smack your lips over a plate of thin potage,
at Monsieur Blancard's, while the <i>carte &agrave; manger</i>, open before you,
gives promise of entremets both rare and numerous.</p>

<p>But this being one of those ad infinitum discourses which may be
prolonged with pleasure, or brought to a close with profit, I shall
here endeavor to stop, premising, first, that in the mighty undertaking
I have assumed, I have secured the assistance of an association
of gentlemen, on whom I can rely with great confidence, and from
whom, as the reader will believe, great things may be expected. I

will give the names of these individuals, as they have been christened

<p>IT is not many months since, that I had been travelling day and
night, over roads of iron, for nearly a week, until my sense of hearing
was almost destroyed, by the continued fiz, fiz-fiz, fiz-fiz, fiz-fiz,
of a steam-engine, the incessant ding-ding, ding-ding, of the alarm
bell, and the prolonged rumble, rumble, rumble, of the rail-car's
wheels. My eyes, too, were well nigh destroyed by sparks of fire, and
flying ashes; but above all, from the want of rest and sleep. It will
be readily imagined, therefore, that it was with no ordinary degree
of pleasure, that I exchanged a seat with an upright wooden back,
in a rail-road car, for the almost by-gone luxury of a couch-like seat
in an old-fashioned stage-coach, which was to take me to the place of my
destination. A blessing rest upon those old-time conveyances, the bare
mention of which calls up a thousand recollections of social pleasures,
that come thronging and fluttering about the nib of my pen, like moths
around a bright light, on a summer evening! But, beautiful creatures!
I can only apostrophize you now. Some other time, I will impale
you upon the end of my quill, and preserve your slight forms in ink.</p>

<p>The day was remarkably fine; our road lay through the pleasantest
parts of pleasant Connecticut, near the picturesque valley of the
Housatonic; our cattle were sleek and fine-looking; the driver was

<!-- vol 14 page 152 -->

civil, and decently dressed; and the coach itself was a miracle.
There was not a rent in the curtains, nor a spring out of order. There
were but two passengers, beside myself, one of whom was one of
those good-natured humorists, who I believe live all their lives in
stage-coaches, for I never met with one any where else; and the
other was an invalid, with his face tied up so that he could not speak.</p>

<p>Never had a weary traveller a sweeter prospect of enjoying a refreshing
nap. We had travelled about a mile, and the easy motion
of the coach had just began to put me and my fellow travellers into
a pleasant sleep, when a shrill voice, exclaiming, 'Stop! stop!'
caused the driver to rein up, which roused me from the delightful
state of incipient somnolency into which I was sinking.</p>

<p>It was an elderly lady, with a monstrous band-box, a paper-covered
trunk, and a little girl. We were of course debarred the satisfaction
of saying a single ill-natured word. The driver dismounted
from his box, and having stowed away the lady's baggage, proceeded
to assist her to store herself away in the coach.</p>

<p>'Driver,' said the 'lady,' 'do you know Deacon Hitchcock?'</p>

<p>'No, ma'am,' replied the driver, 'I have only driv on this road
about a fortnight.'</p>

<p>'I wonder if neither of them gentlemen do n't know him?' she
said, putting her head into the coach.</p>

<p>'I do n't,' said the humorist; 'but I know Deacon Hotchkiss, if
that will answer your purpose.'</p>

<p>'Do n't neither of them other gentlemen know him?' she inquired.</p>

<p>I shook my head, negatively; for I was afraid to speak, lest I
should dispel the charm that sleep had begun to shed over me; and
the invalid shook his head, as he was unable to speak.</p>

<p>'Well, then, I do n't know whether to get in or not,' said the lady,
'for I must see Deacon Hitchcock, before I go home. I am a lone
widow lady, all the way from the state of New-Hampshire, and the
deacon was a very particular friend of my husband's, this little girl's
father, who has been dead two long years; and I should like to see
him 'mazin'ly.'</p>

<p>'Does he live about here?' asked the driver.</p>

<p>'Well, I do n't know for certain,' said the lady; 'but he lives
somewhere in Connecticut. This is the first time I was ever so fur
from home; I live in the state of New-Hampshire, and it is dreadful
unpleasant; I feel a little dubious about riding all alone in a stage
with gentlemen that I never see before in all my life.'</p>

<p>'There is no danger, ma'am,' said the driver; 'the gentlemen won't
hurt you.'</p>

<p>'Well prehaps they won't; but it is very unpleasant for a lady to
be so fur from home; I live in the state of New-Hampshire; and this
little girl's&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You had better get in, ma'am,' said the driver, with praiseworthy
moderation.</p>

<p>'Well, I do n't know but I may as well,' she replied; and after
informing the driver once more that she was from the state of New-Hampshire,
and that her husband had been dead two years, she got
in, and took her seat.</p>

<p>'I will take your fare, ma'am,' said the driver.</p>

<p>'How much is it, Sir?' asked the lady.</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 153 -->

<p>'Four-and-six-pence,' said the driver, 'for yourself and the little
girl.'</p>

<p>'Well, that is a monstrous sight of money, for a little girl's passage,
like that; her father, my husband, has been dead these two long
years, and I was never so fur from home before in all my life. I live in
the state of New-Hampshire. It is very unpleasant for a lady; but
I dare say neither of them gentlemen would see me imposed upon.'</p>

<p>'I will take your fare, if you please, ma'am,' again said the driver,
in a tone bordering somewhat on impatience.</p>

<p>'How much did you say it was?&mdash;three-and-sixpence?' asked the
lady.</p>

<p>'Four-and-six-pence, if you please, ma'am,' said the driver.</p>

<p>'O, <i>four</i>-and-six-pence!' And after a good deal of fumbling, and
shaking of her pockets, she at last produced a half dollar, and a York
shilling, and put them into the driver's hand.</p>

<p>'That is not enough, ma'am,' said the driver; 'I want nine-pence
more.'</p>

<p>'What!&mdash;ain't we in York state?' she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>'No, ma'am,' replied the driver; 'it is six shillings, York money.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the lady, 'I used to be quite good at reckoning, when
I was to home, in the state of New-Hampshire; I've reckoned up
many a fish v'yage; but since I have got so fur from home, I b'lieve
I am beginning to lose my mental faculties.'</p>

<p>'I'll take that other nine-pence, if you please, ma'am,' said the
driver, in a voice approaching a little nearer to impatience. At last,
after making allusion two or three times more to her native state,
and her deceased husband, (happy man!) she handed the driver his
nine-pence, and we were once more in motion. Although my fellow
travellers remained silent all the time she was disputing with the
driver, yet they looked as though they were wishing the New-Hampshire
lady some of the worst wishes that could be imagined.</p>

<p>'Do you think it's <i>dan</i>-gerous on this road?' began the lady, as
soon as the door was closed. 'I am a very lengthy way from home,
in the state of New-Hampshire; and if any thing should happen, I
do n't know what I should do. I am quite unfamiliar with travelling;
and I hope you won't think me obtrusive; I am a widow lady; my
husband, this little girl's father, has been dead these two years, come
this spring; and I am going with her to the Springs: she has got a
dreadful bad complaint in her stomach. Are you going to the Springs,
Sir?' she said, addressing herself to the invalid, who shook his head
in reply.</p>

<p>'Ah; are you going, Sir?' she said, addressing the humorist.</p>

<p>'No, I am not,' he replied; 'and if I were&mdash;&mdash;' But the contingency
was inwardly pronounced.</p>

<p>'Are <i>you?</i>' she asked, turning to me.</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'Ah, I am very sorry; I should like to put myself under the care
of some clever gentleman; it is so awful unpleasant for a lady to
be so fur from home, without a protector. I am from the state of
New-Hampshire, and this is the first time I ever went a-travelling in
my life. Do you know any body in New-Hampshire?'</p>

<p>'No, madam, I do not,' said the humorist, 'and I hope you will excuse
me for saying that I never wish to.'</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 154 -->

<p>'Well, now, that is very stra&auml;nge,' continued the gossip; 'I hav' n't
met a single soul that I know, since I left home; and I am in a public
way, too; I follow school-keepin', mostly, for an occupation; and I
am acquainted with all the first people in the state. I have been a
school-teacher ever since my husband died, this poor little girl's
father, two years ago; and I am very well known in Rocky-bottom,
Rockingham county, in the state of New-Hampshire; I know all the
first gentlemen in the place. There 's Squire Goodwin, Squire Cushman,
Mr. Timothy Havens, Mr. Zaccheus Upham, Doctor David&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Heavens and earth!' exclaimed the humorist, 'I can't stand this!
Driver! stop, and let me get out!'</p>

<p>The driver reined up, and the humorist took his valise in his
hand, and jumped out, followed by the invalid, who set out to walk
back to the tavern we had left behind us. I thought the New-Hampshire
lady would probably understand the cause of our fellow-traveller's
sudden departure, and leave me to the quiet enjoyment of my
nap. I never was more mistaken. No sooner was the coach in motion
again, than she began to pour out such a running stream of surmises,
and questions, about 'them gentlemen that had left us,' mingled
with reminiscences of New-Hampshire, and her deceased husband,
that I began to wish myself back again on board of a rail-road car.
At length, driven to desperation, I was compelled to call out to the
driver to stop, and let <i>me</i> get out. The lady was very earnest in
her endeavors to persuade me to remain; but I was regardless of
her entreaties, although not exactly deaf to them. I took my wallet,
determined to wait until the next coach came along. I was some
distance from a tavern, but there was a quiet-looking burying-ground,
just at the foot of the hill, which to my wearied eyes held out a promise
of rest; and as the sun was low, I determined to leap over the picket-fence,
and with my wallet for a pillow, take a nap on the dry, warm
grass.</p>

<p>It was a calm, secluded spot, surrounded by romantic hills, covered
to their summits with beautiful trees. 'Fitting rest,' thought I, 'for
pious age and innocent youth!' And such it proved to be. The
modest white marble stones with which the ground was studded, were
nothing but records of virtues and dates. Here were buried a governor,
a chief justice, a lesser judge, deacons, pastors, and minor
dignitaries, a good many. But whether man, woman, or child; husband,
parent, or son; judge, pastor, or deacon; wife, spinster, or
daughter; there was the most astonishing similarity of goodness of
character and purity of life. My curiosity was excited, to know
where so many excellent people could have lived; for I had but small
experience in tomb-stones, and did not know that they always told
the same story. But I was too weary to seek for information on the
subject; and having found a proper spot, I stretched myself out
upon the ground, and immediately fell asleep. Upon this, my wandering
spirit took the liberty of stepping out of its tabernacle, and
making another tour of the tomb-stones; and I was not a little amused
to find they told quite a different story from what they did at first.
And yet I was not at all astonished; for it is one of the peculiarities
of dreams, that nothing ever surprises, though it be ever so absurd
and paradoxical. I saw the self-same white marble tablets, but there

<!-- vol 14 page 155 -->

was a curious alteration in the inscriptions which they bore. For
instance:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">Here lies y<sup>e</sup> mortal remains of<br/>

</div>

<p>It was a relief to read the next; a little brown stone, at the head
of a tiny mound of turf, which was bright and green, as though it
had been watered with tears:</p>

</div>

<!-- vol 14 page 156 -->

<p>As I raised my eyes from the next stone, which bore a record of
crimes perpetrated by a man who had borne the character of an honorable
gentleman, while living, I perceived one of those beautiful
beings standing by my side, who sometimes visit us in our sleep, but
take especial care to shun us in our waking hours.</p>

<p>'<i>Nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela?</i>' said the beautiful apparition.</p>

<p>'So I perceive,' I replied; 'but I did not know before that ghosts
spoke French.'</p>

<p>'It is the universal language,' replied the spirit.</p>

<p>'I know it is,' I replied; 'but I think it would be well for spirits
to speak in the vernacular of those to whom their visits are paid.'</p>

<p>'<i>Vous avez raison</i>,' answered the spirit.</p>

<p>'I think the millennium must be at hand,' I said, looking inquiringly
into her face; 'and perhaps you have come to announce it.
For what man will ever again dare to do evil, with the knowledge that
his villanies will be inscribed upon his tomb at his death? I can anticipate
a mighty change in the world, from this new fashion in grave-stones.'</p>

<p>Suddenly the beautiful appearance changed into a wild Mephistophilian
shape, and uttered such a wild demoniacal 'Ha! ha!' that I
started upon my feet, with my heart beating as though it would break
through my ribs. It was a lusty young bull, that had obtruded his
head through an aperture in the fence, near where I lay, and his loud
bellowing had broken in upon my sweet sleep.</p>

<p>Thinking I heard a voice like that which haunted the guilty Macbeth,
I hurried out of the grave-yard, and having reached the tavern, I sat
down upon the piazza, where I enjoyed what I so much needed, a
good nap.</p>

<p>If all the wild flowers of the forest and prairie bore upon their
leaves an inscription of their medicinal properties, the pleasure with
which we regard them would be more than half destroyed. So,
gentle reader, if I were to inscribe at the head of these pages, 'This
is a sermon in disguise,' or, 'This essay is good for bad morals,' or,
'This story will be found very effectual in softening a hard heart,' if
you read them at all, it would be with far other than pleasurable feelings.
I shall leave, therefore, to your own keen perceptions, the
task of discovering the hidden qualities of these seemingly light and
trivial papers. But be assured, that like those beautiful children of
the summer, whose exhalations perfume the air, and whose delicate
colors charm the eye, these 'Gimcrackeries' shall contain an essence
which shall be for the healing of those who have the ingenuity to
extract it.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF POPPY VAN BUSTER,</p>

<p class="small">IN THREE CHAPTERS: BEING THE RELATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WELL KNOWN TO MANY
LIVING AND CREDIBLE PERSONS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE PRESENT CENTURY, AND
THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO THE DISTINCTION OF BEING CALLED A TALE.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">WILL INTRODUCE THE READER TO THE MANSION OF THE VAN BUSTERS, AND ALSO TO THE PRINCIPAL
PERSONAGES OF THIS HISTORY.</p>

</div>

<p>IT has justly been observed, by a very great philosopher, that 'Time
levels all things;' but there is nothing to which the old destroyer pays
less respect, than a wooden house. Time, however, is a conservative,
compared with those destructive gentlemen who compose the common
council of this famous city. No sooner do they take their oaths
of office, than they begin to pass laws for the demolition of a thousand
or two houses, in different parts of the town, without the smallest
regard to the remonstrances of their occupants; and if there should
chance to be such a thing as a green hill within their jurisdiction, they
proceed to level it without delay. This they facetiously term 'making
improvements.' The consequences attendant upon this system of
house-demolishing, must, of necessity, in some instances, be picturesque
in the highest degree, and in almost all cases, very melancholy.
The disastrous consequences of one of these 'improvements'
will form the subject of these chapters.</p>

<p>In one of the long, strait avenues which beautify the upper part of
this tumultuous metropolis, stretching its flagged walks far beyond the
vision of an ordinary eye, stood the wooden mansion of the Van Buster
family. It was perched at a fearful height from the surrounding
pavement, on ground barely sufficient to bear its weight; and being
propped up by numerous slender poles, and long pieces of scantling,
it bore no small resemblance to one of those entomological specimens,
to which Nature, in her bounty, appears to have given legs sufficient
for half its species. But I doubt if the Van Buster house would
have kept its airy position with one prop or one inch of ground less;
indeed, the only wonder was, how it kept together at all. Time and
the elements had done their worst, and reduced it to as ricketty and
worthless a condition as the most inveterate lover of ruin could
have desired. The little urchins in the neighborhood no longer tried
their skill in archery, by shooting at its windows; for there was not
a glazed pane left in the whole building, and the quilted petticoats
which supplied the place of glass, were not so easily demolished;
they were left undisturbed to bleach in the sun and rain. The gable-end
which looked into the newly-opened avenue, bore, in curiously
shaped iron figures, the date of its birth, '1779;' and no one would
have guessed that it had sprang into existence a year later.</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 238 -->

<p>On either side, it was flanked by long rows of flat-roofed houses,
flaunting in all the pride of red paint, and green Venetian blinds.
Every body wondered that such a fashionable street should be disgraced
by such an antiquated piece of architecture; for there is
nothing so repugnant to fashion as antiquity. The old house
hung upon the fair fame of the neighborhood, like the old man of the
sea on the shoulders of Sinbad the Sailor. Rents of genteel houses
opposite were not more than double what their tenants could afford
to pay; and hence landlords were loud in their complaints against
the venerable old pile. All the Irish chambermaids in the street
used to cross themselves as they passed it of an evening, and the
darkies would roll up the whites of their eyes, in evident consternation,
as they shuffled past; for some wicked individuals had got up a story
that the house was haunted. The report, however, as my enlightened
reader will suppose, had no foundation in fact. But it was not
surprising that the old house should be regarded with a suspicious
eye, by those whose faith was stronger than their philosophy; for the
absence of all signs of in-dwelling life gave it a most gloomy and
mysterious appearance. It sent a chill to the heart, to hear the shutters
creaking on their rusty hinges, when the wind was high; and
many a little slumberer has been startled from a pleasant sleep, by
the slamming of its doors, on a stormy night. It was true, that sometimes,
of a still morning, a light curling smoke might be seen rising
out of an aperture in the roof; but</p>

<p class="small">'The smoking chimnies, which should be<br/>

The wind-pipes of good hospitalitie,'</p>

<p>were gone; the cheerful peals of women's tongues, the merry sound
of children's voices, and the light-hearted, infectious laugh of innocence
and youth, were no longer heard within its walls; the beggar
no longer rested at the door, and the prowling thief, in his remorseless
rounds, passed it wholly by.</p>

<p>The sole occupant of this apparently deserted mansion, was POPPY
VAN BUSTER, the principal personage in this history, and the last
of his family. Some asserted that he was the first, also; for in this
metropolis, where a neighborhood changes its population once in ten
years, at least, it could not be expected that any of Poppy's neighbors
should remember so far back as when he was born. There
seemed to be a sympathy between him and his house; and as no body
beside him could have been found hardy enough to sleep under its
dilapidated roof, so, it was thought, it would not have kept itself above
the head of any one else.</p>

<p>The once numerous family of the Van Busters, owing to non-marriage,
and various accidents, had dwindled away, until poor
Poppy was left in his old age, without a companion in the world, save
an old China parrot, which one of his ancestors had brought over from
Holland. All the associates of his younger years had long been
swept away by the tide of time. Some had gone to seek their fortunes
on the grand canal; some had become great speculators and
some great rogues; others had been hung, and some had found their
way to the alms-house. Not a solitary companion had Poppy, to return
his greeting in the morning, or to bid him good night, when he
retired to rest. But his old house was to him father, and mother, and

<!-- vol 14 page 239 -->

friend; he loved the very cobwebs with which its blackened walls
were festooned; and his heart clung to it with greater fondness, as
day after day he saw all the old familiar objects in his neighborhood
disappear, and something new and strange rise up in their place. Here
a green hillock, on whose gentle slope he had many times basked in
the warm sun, was levelled, to fill up a pond where he had skated
when a boy; and there a long alley of sycamores and weeping willows
were succeeded by a stationary army of tall black lamp-posts;
and where every thing was once green, and fresh, and pleasant, all
was changed to close, confined streets; and green meadows and
noble orchards were succeeded by a hard pavement, and little bits of
dusty gardens. These changes filled the heart of our hero with grief,
and his head with dismay. He would sit and ponder for hours, puzzling
his brain with vague surmises about the probable cause of all
the strange movements that were going on around him. He had
never read a newspaper, or spent an evening in a bar-room, in his
life; how then could he know any thing about the great improvements
that were going on in the world? The word had not got into
general use, when he mixed with his fellow citizens; and steam-engines,
and electro-magnetism, to say nothing of phrenology, and
clairvoyance, were subjects of which he knew no more than his China
parrot.</p>

<p>Indeed, so ignorant was Poppy of the true condition of things,
that he honestly thought that the bricks, of which the interminable
rows of houses in his neighborhood were built, all came from Holland.
Although he was never known to perpetrate a joke but once
in his life, and that was when, one April fool's day, he placed a tub of
dirty water on top of the barn-door, and then was the first to open it
himself, yet he would occasionally indulge in a quizzical smile, when
he looked upon the flat-roofed houses all around him, and compared
them with the tall gables of his own well-beloved mansion, which
were so cool and pleasant in summer, and so well calculated in winter
to slide off the snow which was sure to fall upon them; they were
exactly adapted to the exigences of the climate, and Poppy thought
to himself, 'How powerful is fashion, that, spite of beauty, comfort,
and convenience, makes men adopt her models, whether suited to
their wants or not!'</p>

<p>Hardly a day passed by, in which Poppy did not receive either an
offer from some speculator for his lot, or a threat from the street commissioners,
that his house should be pulled down about his ears, if he
did not leave it. But temptations and threats were alike unavailing.
At one time, the corporation had the appraised value of the
land carted up to his door, all in specie; thinking, silly body! that
the sight of so much silver would overcome his sturdy Dutch
affections. He did not even deign a reply to the insulting act, but
continued quietly smoking his pipe, with his eyes resting on his China
parrot, all the while the agent of the corporation was remonstrating
with him. On one occasion he did, indeed, condescend to make a
reply, when he was sorely beset. His honor, the mayor, thinking
to awe him into compliance, called on him in person. But this dignified
unbending of official greatness failed of its expected effect.
His honor found our hero smoking his pipe, as usual, in his little parlor;

<!-- vol 14 page 240 -->

but not being aware of the quality of his visitor, or probably
anticipating the errand on which he had come, Poppy did not even
rise to greet him. This want of courtesy the worthy magistrate
affected not to notice, but began his remonstrance, in a tone of subdued
dignity; for he was a cunning man, and knew that nothing
could be gained by violence.</p>

<p>He began by making a few magniloquent and incomprehensible
remarks, such as are suitable for great occasions, and having discoursed
on the march of mind, the influence of steam, and other matters
quite as foreign to the subject in his thoughts, he gradually developed
to the unmoveable old man the object of his visit. He even condescended
to read, from a yellow sheep-skin volume which he had
brought with him, the law which compels a man to yield up his property
at the will of the common council, whether he be disposed to
do so or not. He then went on to cite innumerable precedents,
enough to have terrified the soul of any body but a Dutchman. But the
eloquence of the mayor, the law, and the precedents, had no more
effect upon Poppy, than they had upon his China parrot; for he had,
if possible, a greater contempt for the laws, than he had for improvements.
But his honor, like a skilful general, had reserved the force
of his fire for a rallying charge. He told Poppy, with great exultation,
that the board had passed a resolution to build him a new house,
with marble mantels, and folding-doors, exactly like those which
surrounded him, if he would quietly consent to vacate his old one.
At the bare mention of such an abomination, Poppy threw down
his pipe, jumped upon his feet, and swore a terrible oath, all the
blood in his body rushing the while into his withered face.</p>

<p>'No!' he exclaimed, 'never! This is my house; it was my father's;
it has never deserted me, and I will never leave it! I was
born here&mdash;I will die here!'</p>

<p>The worthy magistrate was electrified, and finding that Poppy was
impervious alike to law and eloquence, he suddenly withdrew, without
displaying any of those pleasant and dignified airs with which he
had entered; as a company of warriors will march into battle, observing
all the rules of the strictest martial etiquette, and making a
great flourish of drums and trumpets, but finding it necessary to make
a retreat, will scamper off, every man for himself, without paying the
smallest respect to army tactics.</p>

<p>At the next meeting of the common council, the mayor sent in
a report of his proceedings; whereupon it was resolved, that Poppy
Van Buster was a stubborn old Dutchman, and that he and his old
house should be forthwith removed, <i>vi et armis</i>.</p>

<p>The work of destruction went daily on, and Poppy disputed every
inch of ground, until his house was left standing in the fearful situation
in which we have described it. Here the levellers stopped.
They had an undefinable dread of going farther. Whether they
desisted out of respect to old gentleman's affection, or whether
they feared that he would invoke some dreadful calamity on their
heads, is not now known. The corporation winked at the neglect of
their agents, and consoled themselves with the expectation, that the
next September gale would certainly topple down the old house, or
that death would shortly overcome the obstinacy of its tenant. But

<!-- vol 14 page 241 -->

gale succeeded gale, and season followed season; and neither Poppy
nor his house gave any signs of immediate dissolution. How long
they would have continued in existence, it is impossible to conceive,
had not chance, which has brought to a close matters of greater importance
than this, when design has failed, at length consigned both
house and tenant to their native dust.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">CONTAINS A HISTORICAL FACT, WHICH THE READER MAY NEVER HAVE ENCOUNTERED BEFORE.</p>

</div>

<p>IT so happened that Poppy was one morning inspecting an old
chest of drawers, which once belonged to his great aunt, when he
found a large roll of faded taffeta, tied up with innumerable pieces of
thread, and worsted yarn. An unusual curiosity prompted him to
examine its contents. After removing a good many envelopes, all
of which were carefully tied up like the outer one, he at last came to
a small roll of what appeared to be nothing more than dirty brown
paper, but on close examination, it proved to be continental money.
He remembered that during his aunt's life time, she was supposed to
be immensely rich, but that on her death, the only article of value
found among her effects, was an old tortoise-shell snuff-box. 'This
then,' thought Poppy, as he unrolled the bundle of continental notes,
'was my aunt's fortune!' And he could not but think, that Providence
had thrown in his way this hidden treasure, to reward him for
his constancy in clinging to the home of his ancestors. His next
thought was how to dispose of such an enormous sum of money;
and after reflecting on the subject almost a month, it occurred to him
that his cousin Nicholas, who lived in Coenties' slip, was entitled to
one half of it; and he determined to make him a visit, and announce
his good fortune to him; for Poppy was the soul of honesty, notwithstanding
he was such an inveterate enemy to modern improvements.
He never wasted a thought on the probability of his finding his cousin,
although it was a very long time since he had heard of him; but
immediately commenced selecting himself a dress, from the extensive
wardrobe of his ancestors, in which to make his visit. It was the
old gentleman's wish to avoid observation, for he dreaded the consequences
of being seen away from his house, and had a vague idea
of the mutabilities of fashion. He therefore very discreetly selected
the most modern dress he could find. This consisted of a pair of
velvet breeches, with a patch on each knee, but so little faded, that
there was considerable room for guessing at their original color,
which might have been green. The fashion of the coat was quite
indescribable. Its collar was very small, but the tailor, as if conscious
of having done a wrong to that part of the garment, had made most
exuberant tails, with yawning pockets, of fearful capacity, which told as
plainly as pockets could speak, that the date of their construction was
anterior to the race of pick-pockets in this thriving city. The crown
of his hat was about the shape and size of a great bowl; and the
rim being broad, it was buttoned up at the sides, to keep it from
slouching. Thus equipped, did the honest old gentleman steal
quietly out of his house, one pleasant morning in July, to go in search

<!-- vol 14 page 242 -->

of his cousin Nicholas, just as the sun was beginning his daily task of
heating the tiled roofs and cobble-paved streets of the 'commercial
emporium,' as well as every other emporium in the Union. A slight
moisture suffused his eyes, as he heard the heavy sound of his footsteps
on the hard flagging of the street, for it called to mind the verdant
carpeting which once overspread the very place where he was
walking. But he drove away all melancholy feelings, by thinking of
his aunt's fortune, and imagining the pleasant surprise of his cousin
Nicholas, when he should hear of his good luck.</p>

<p>But alas! that we should anticipate pleasures, when even those
which are enjoyed pass away before we are scarcely sensible of
possessing them! O that men would learn, from the continued decay
going on around them, never to fasten their affections upon mere
earthly things! Little did Poppy think, when he left his old house
that pleasant summer morning, that never again should his head rest
beneath its venerable roof. He had advanced but a short distance on
his honest errand, when Fortune, who is never asleep when there is
mischief to be perpetrated, directed the street inspector to the very
spot where our hero was quietly trudging along. That indefatigable
officer was taking a short ride, for the benefit of the morning air; and
his attention being arrested by a strange-looking figure, he presently
discovered it to be none other than Poppy himself; and no sooner did
he become satisfied of this fact, than he turned his horse's head, and
rode full tilt to the mayor's, to give information that our hero was
abroad. The mayor immediately sent notice of the fact to the recorder,
and the recorder sent notices to the members of the two
boards; and before the good citizens of the commercial metropolis
had finished their breakfasts, the common council were assembled in
joint ballot, all political differences were forgotten, and as there was
no time for any member to make a display of eloquence, by opposing
a measure at first, which he intended to support in the end, it was
unanimously resolved that they would form a procession, and with
the mayor and the recorder at their head, proceed immediately to the
house of the Van Busters, and behold its demolition.</p>

<p>The procession was accordingly formed; and there being no time
to send off invitations to the strangers of distinction then in the city,
they were joined by no one, excepting the chimney-sweeps, and a few
runaway boys from the House of Refuge, a part of the community
who, as is well known, have a great fondness for all kinds of processions
and celebrations, whether civil or military. When they arrived
in front of the devoted mansion, the honorable body, nothing daunted
by the fiery hot rays which Sol, as if in anger, was pouring down upon
them, respectfully uncovered their heads, while the mayor delivered
a speech on the novel subjects of the march of mind, anthracite coal,
and other matters in fashion at that time. When he closed, the mob
gave three cheers, the corporation workmen took their axes from
their broad shoulders, and the work of destruction began. In one
short hour, the venerable mansion of the Van Busters, once the pride
of Manhattan Island, lay a mass of shapeless ruins.</p>

<p>Before the clouds of dust, caused by the overthrow of the worm-eaten
house, had settled away, the corporation voted to each of its
members a silver medal, in commemoration of the event, settled a

<!-- vol 14 page 243 -->

pension on the street inspector, and complimented each other on their
liberality and energy. They then adjourned to Bellevue, to eat green
turtle, and drink champagne, where they spent the remainder of the
day in elegant enjoyment.</p>

<p>The curious in such matters may find a full account of the toasts
drank on that occasion, with several other interesting particulars, in
the evening papers of that day.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">RELATES WHAT BEFEL THE HERO OF THIS STORY, WHILE ON HIS JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF HIS
COUSIN NICHOLAS, AND ALSO THE PARTICULARS OF HIS MELANCHOLY END.</p>

</div>

<p>POPPY continued to trudge along, after the street inspector had
met him; but at one time his forebodings were so gloomy, that he
half determined to turn back, and endeavor to get word to his cousin
Nicholas, without visiting him in person; something, however, caught
his eye at the moment, and he travelled onward, until he found himself
surrounded by a great crowd in Broadway, who pressed him so
hard, that he thought it would be better for him to wait until evening
before he returned, as then, he reasoned, all the people would be at
home, smoking their pipes, and he could walk along unmolested.
Many and wonderful were the sights which he encountered; and at
times, all thoughts of himself and his house were swallowed up in
contemplating the curious objects around him. He was stunned by
strange noises, and his senses were fairly bewildered by the odd-looking
people who were continually passing him. Sometimes a bevy
of gay creatures would whisk by him, looking so queer, and yet so
beautiful, that Poppy could compare them to nothing but the angel
forms that he sometimes fancied he saw in his dreams; but these far
outstripped in lightness and gayety any thing he had ever conceived
of an a&euml;rial being. He looked in vain, on every side, hoping to see
something that resembled himself. Once, indeed, he was startled at
the sight of a familiar form, but as he looked wistfully toward it, he
discovered it was only the reflection of his own person in a long
mirror, which stood at a shop door. He began to feel that weary
heart-heaviness which many of us have experienced, when we have
found ourselves alone in a gay crowd, where there was not one familiar
face to greet us with a kindly smile. Ah! who would leave
home, where he might live, loving and beloved, to mingle, uncared
for, in the gayest circles that ever crowded the halls of a palace!</p>

<p>It was late in the day, before Poppy reached the spot where he
supposed the little yellow house of his cousin Nicholas still stood;
for he did not believe that one who bore his name could be guilty of
either pulling down his house, or of selling it; he would as soon have
thought of selling his father's bones. But the house of his cousin
was gone, and in its place, a tall brick store, with a foundation of solid
granite pillars, lifted its head almost into the clouds. He looked in
at one of the doors, and saw a great many finely-dressed young men
moving about like bees in a hive, behind long ranges of counters and
boxes. A young gentleman, with a tuft of yellowish hair under his
chin, and a pen behind his ear, asked him if he wished to purchase a
lot of cheap goods for cash. But Poppy made no reply. He sat

<!-- vol 14 page 244 -->

down on an empty box, at the door, to rest his old limbs, and was
almost disposed to curse himself for his folly in leaving his house.
But he derived consolation from the prospect of smoking his pipe in
quiet, when he should reach home; and as the sun had set, he began
his homeward journey. He found the crowd in Broadway even
greater than it was in the morning; and his perplexity was greatly
increased, for he could not conceive where all the people came from,
nor where they were going. The glare of the gas lights astonished him
more than any thing that he had encountered. To see a bright flame
issuing from a little slender brass tube, exceeded every thing he had
ever beheld, or heard tell of. But his head having become a little
used to the noise, he did not meet with so much difficulty in groping
along, as he did in the morning, although his old legs almost sank
under him, they were so weary.</p>

<p>At last, he reached the long avenue, where, he fondly thought, his
house was standing to receive him. His heart leaped within him for
joy, as he turned out of Broadway, and heard the tread and shuffling
of feet die away behind him. How much pleasanter, he thought, as
he hurried on, was the solitary but familiar creaking of his old window-shutters,
as they turned on their rusty hinges, than the vile Babel-like
jargon he had been listening to all day! But when he
came to the little eminence on which he had left his house standing,
in all the pride of antiquity, and beheld nothing but a heap of rubbish,
his heart seemed to wither within him. He leaned against a post for
support, and cast his eyes imploringly to heaven. A sickly ray of
hope enlivened him; perhaps he had mistaken the street, and it was
some other person's, and not his own misfortune, that he was contemplating.
He put his hand in his pocket for his handkerchief, to wipe
away the moisture from his eyes, but it was gone: it had been spirited
away in the crowd through which he had passed. 'Ah!' he exclaimed,
'this all comes of that vile money! I will scatter it to the
winds; it shall do no more harm to any body.' He made a motion
with his hand to take the odious bundle from his pocket, but the flap
of his coat was gone, pocket and all! Again he cast an imploring
look to heaven, which seemed to ask if an old man's wrongs should
go unavenged. He then groped along over the ruins which lay
around him, and having found an old stair-case, he climbed up, and
discovered his old three-cornered chair standing unhurt. His foot
struck upon something hard; he stooped to pick it up; it was part
of his China parrot; and even this frail relic gave him a momentary
pleasure.</p>

<p>The moon had just risen, and her bright beams, as they gleamed
through the apertures in the wall, appeared to Poppy the spiritualized
forms of his ancestors, hovering over him. The wind, as it swept by
him, and sighed through the rifted crevices in the walls, seemed to
mourn for his loss. He cast his eyes above him, and beheld a beam
stretching over his head, as if tendering him its consolatory support.
He untied his cravat, threw a hurried, anxious glance over the desolate
scene, and the next moment, Misfortune had done her last deed.</p>

<p>In the morning, Poppy was found hanging from the only remaining
rafter of his once dearly beloved mansion. Not a passer-by that
saw the old man, with his white locks streaming upon the wind, but
blessed himself that he had no hand in causing his unhappy end.</p>

<p>STORY OF THE HAUNTED MERCHANT</p>

</div>

<p>LORD BYRON made a palpable hit, when he said that truth was
stranger than fiction; and the world has acknowledged the correctness
of the saying, by an incessant repetition of it, ever since it was
uttered. From information in my possession, I have been enabled to
make a very nice calculation, by which it appears that the aforesaid
truism has been repeated one million, nine hundred and sixty-eight
thousand, five hundred and forty-seven times, during the last fifteen
years. And this is sufficient to establish the truth of his lordship's
proposition. Truth, then, being stranger than fiction, it follows, as a
matter of course, that the latter must be more natural than the
former; and hence we perceive the reason why romances have
always been preferred to histories, by the majority of readers. A
fact so evident, I conceive, can require no illustration, and therefore
I will not waste the valuable time of my reader, by diving into the
depths of forgotten learning, to bring up instances of excellent books
which appear to have sunk in the ocean of time, in consequence of
the great weight of the mighty truths which they contained; while
many contemporary works have floated lightly upon the same ocean,
and still continue to dance gaily upon its waves, apparently not possessed
of truth enough to sink them in its waters.</p>

<p>I have felt myself called upon to make these apologetic remarks,
by way of preface to the fictitious story that I am about to present to
the world, because some very learned and grave critics, who spend

<!-- vol 14 page 318 -->

the greater part of their lives in studying Greek tragedies and German
metaphysics, have thought proper, in their pride of wisdom, to
speak sneeringly of the unmixed creations of the human brain, and
to attempt to stigmatize as unprofitable servants those who labor in
the pure regions of romance. But I am desirous that my work
should live, and therefore I shall exclude all those weighty truths from
it, which would infallibly sink it to the lowest depths of the ocean of
oblivion. A vessel freighted with such precious metals as moral
reflections and German metaphysics, political essays and Swedenborgian
sermons, histories of kings, and chronicles of common councils,
state papers, and the lives of eminent statesmen; and other
equally valuable matters, could hardly hope to ride out in safety one
autumnal gale; and I doubt whether an underwriter could be found,
at any insurance board in the world, adventurous enough to take a
risk on such a cargo, at ever so high a premium.</p>

<p>To those brave spirits who still refuse to bow the knee to the stern
idols of these latter days, and who do not refuse to accompany the
spirit of romance in her upward flights, where they inhale the soothing
atmosphere of the regions of delight, this tale is offered with affectionate
confidence.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">CHAPTER ONE.</p>

<p class="small">WILL INTRODUCE THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES OF THIS STORY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SOMEWHAT
UNFAVORABLE.</p>

</div>

<p>TREMLETT AND TUCK was the name of one of the oldest, the
richest, and consequently the most respectable, 'firms' in the great
city of New-York. And to be entitled to this distinction, in a city
where there are so many old, and rich, and respectable firms, argued
of necessity a degree of eminence to which but very few firms could
ever hope to attain. But mercantile greatness, above all other kinds
of greatness, can never be the effect of accident. A general or a
commodore may, by a chance shot, over which he had no control, be
placed upon the very apex of Fame's pyramid; an author even, may,
by the lucky choice of a subject for the exhibition of his talents, immortalize
himself, and put money in his purse; but it is only by industry,
length of days, self-denial, integrity of conduct, and good luck,
that a merchant can become renowned; and even then, his fame must
cease when he loses his hold upon life.</p>

<p>Mr. HUBBARD CROCKER TREMLETT and Mr. GRISWOLD BACON
TUCK were old men. They had formed their copartnership when they
were young, with a determination of doing a safe business, and intending,
as soon as they could afford it, each to take a wife; and I presume
no young men ever commenced business with any other determination,
unless, indeed, they had been so imprudent as to get married first.
Messrs. Tremlett and Tuck adhered strictly to their first determination,
and consequently became rich and respectable; but neither had
ever felt that he could afford to get married; and they found themselves
at last with whitened locks, the possessors of an immense fortune,
but with solitary firesides, and without a living soul to care a
straw for either, unless it were those who hoped every day would be
their last; expecting that a slender thread of consanguinity would

<!-- vol 14 page 319 -->

enable them to seize the wealth which they had no hand in accumulating.</p>

<p>The solitariness of their situation never disturbed the junior
partner. He wanted no better company, and no surer friends, than
his certificates of deposite, his bank scrip, and his private ledger.
Time gave his annual warnings in vain to Mr. Tuck. He thought no
more about dying, than he did at twenty. The admonitions of death
and eternity he heeded not. He knew that people died, because
he had made several bad debts, in consequence of the untimely
removal from this world of some of his debtors; his parents had also
died, and his brothers and sisters; but he never really thought that
HE should die; it was something so foreign to a regular business transaction,
that the fact that he MUST die, never once occurred to him. It
was true, he had his life insured, as he had his ships; but in so doing,
he only acted in conformity to an established rule, never to let a risk
remain uncovered. Therefore Mr. Tuck continued to make close
bargains, and extend his operations, more in the spirit of a man just
entering upon life, than like one just about to leave it.</p>

<p>Mr. Tremlett differed materially from his partner. The consciousness
of a life misspent, notwithstanding the wealth he had accumulated,
oppressed him sorely at times. He felt the want of a comforter.
He could penetrate the sinister motives of those who treated him with
deferential respect, and their hollow-hearted and loveless attentions
were a thousand times more disagreeable to him than an open and
expressed hatred would have been. He had applied himself so closely
to his business, that he had indulged no opportunities either for seeing
the world, or for extending and increasing his friends and acquaintances;
and although his name, and even his hand-writing, was familiarly
known at the remote ends of the earth, yet there was not one
solitary being to whom he could, in confidence, lay open his heart, or
who looked up to him for consolation and support. This was a dismal
condition for an old man to find himself in; and sometimes Mr. Tremlett
thought that he might have been happier, if he had gained more
friends and fewer dollars.</p>

<p>As he was pacing the tagged walk of the Battery, one sultry afternoon
in mid-summer, gazing listlessly on the beautiful scene spread
out before him, and musing on his peculiar situation, he suddenly
felt something dragging at his coat-tail, and turning his head quickly,
he perceived a little boy in the act of picking his pocket of a new
bandanna. He caught the young thief by the arm; and as the little
rascal struggled to escape, he looked up into the old gentleman's face
with such a bright and merry countenance, that his captor felt more
like clasping him in his arms, than punishing him for his depravity.
The rogue was not more than nine years old, and his countenance
bespoke any thing but a wicked disposition. He was ragged and
bare-footed; but young and poverty-stricken as he appeared, he was
already engaged in trade; he had a bundle of penny papers under
his arm, and a half-dozen of comic almanacs in his hand. Had he
been an older or an ugly brat, it is probable that Mr. Tremlett would
have given him a cuff on his ears, and let him go, to practise his thieving
propensities upon the coat pockets of other citizens; but his extreme
youth, and his childish beauty, made such an impression

<!-- vol 14 page 320 -->

upon the old merchant's sympathies, that he felt unwilling to release
him, until he had done something for his benefit. He therefore
dragged the little fellow along, in spite of his kicks and cries,
until he came to his own house, which was in the neighborhood,
when he gave him in charge of his house-keeper, who washed the
young culprit's face, and gave him a monstrous slice of bread and
butter, which he had no sooner eaten, than, taking his bundle of penny
papers, and his comic almanacs, for a pillow, he stretched himself
out upon the rug, and fell asleep. And there we will leave him to
enjoy his innocent slumbers, while we make an explanation to the
reader, to prevent his falling into an error to which his former readings
may have rendered him liable. But as this will be a break in the
narrative, let us close this chapter, and for the sake of completeness,
begin afresh in the next.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">CHAPTER TWO.</p>

<p class="small">INCLUDES A 'CURTAILED ABBREVIATION, COMPRESSING MANY PARTICULARS.'</p>

</div>

<p>THE ragged little vagabond whom we have left asleep on a rug in
Mr. Tremlett's house, with his head resting on a bundle of penny
papers, is to be the hero of this history, and the reader will of course
prepare himself to feel a very lively interest in his behalf. But our
young hero is not a whit better than he appears to be. He is not the
son of any body of whom the reader will ever hear, and it will not
turn up, in the end, that any of the personages hereinafter to be
mentioned, are in the slightest degree related to him; for the truth
is, his mother was an Irish chambermaid, who came to an untimely
end in consequence of a blow on her temple, which she received from
a jealous Milesian at a ball on Saint Patrick's Eve, in Anthony-street;
and her little darlint, then but eighteen months old, was removed to
an orphan asylum, where he had remained until a few days before the
period at which this history begins, when he had contrived to effect
an escape into the world, where he had made out to support himself
by picking up every thing he could lay his hands upon, and by selling
penny papers and comic almanacs at half profits, for a dealer in those
useful articles. Whether he would have ended his days on the gallows,
or at Sing-Sing, had he not attempted to pick the pocket of the
senior partner of the highly respectable firm of Tremlett and Tuck,
of course can never be known, as it is a difficult matter to make a
guess at the complexion of events which never took place. It will be
seen, in the last chapter, the sad-enough end that he did make, and
that ought to satisfy the reasonable curiosity of the most inquisitive
reader. Life would be a weary load, if we were to be informed beforehand
of every thing that would happen to us as we bore it onward; and
the reading a story would be the heaviest task a man could impose upon
himself, if the catastrophe were revealed to him in the first chapter.
I shall not, therefore, in cruel kindness, throw out farther hints about
the final winding up of the affairs of our hero, but let the catastrophe
of his history gradually develope itself, according to the established
rules, both of nature and art.</p>

<p>After Mr. Tremlett had consigned his little captive to the charge of
Mrs. Swazey, his house-keeper, he went down to his counting-room

<!-- vol 14 page 321 -->

to make his arrangements for the next day's payments; a practice
that he had never omitted, for more than twenty years. But instead
of remaining to chat with his partner and his head book-keeper about
the currency, and other kindred matters, for an hour or two, he jumped
up as soon as his task was finished, and hurried back to his house.
The thought of there being somebody at home that required his
attention, gave the old merchant an excitement that he had not known
since he was first elected a bank director. When he reached his
house, he found the little vagabond sound asleep on the rug, and notwithstanding
he had persuaded himself that it was his duty to send
the boy out to the House of Correction, when he looked upon the
cherub-like face before him, his heart softened, and his resolution faltered;
and he almost blushed at the thoughts that obtruded themselves
upon his mind. The lad had a beautiful head of glossy hair,
which, in spite of the discipline that had shorn it of its full glories,
clung in curls to his neck and temples, as if enamoured of his lovely
skin; the delicate flow of youthful health overspread his cheeks, and
his parted lips displayed a row of teeth unusually white and even, in
one so young. Mr. Tremlett sighed as he looked upon the sleeping
child; perhaps he was thinking of the time when he himself was as
young, as innocent, and as beautiful; or he might have been casting
up in his mind how many thousand dollars he would have been willing
to have given, if he could but call the urchin his own. He looked
around the room to see if he was observed, and then sank upon his
knees by the side of the child; but whether it was to put up a prayer
in his behalf, or to kiss his ruddy cheek, is not known. A tear
glistened in the merchant's eyes; a fountain had been unsealed
in his heart; his eyes ran over, and a tear falling upon the face
of the boy, awakened him from his sleep; and as he fixed his
blue eyes upon the figure by his side, he appeared suddenly struck
with awe, for his hitherto smiling features assumed a grave and
serious aspect. Mr. Tremlett jumped upon his feet, very hastily,
and walking across the room three or four times, he sat down in his
arm-chair, and trying to speak as near like a criminal judge as he
could, he bade the boy get upon his feet, for he was already sitting
upon his haunches, and looking round him with genuine astonishment
pictured in his countenance.</p>

<p>'Come here, Sir!' said Mr. Tremlett. The little fellow approached
his chair with as much confidence as a child would have gone to a
parent.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' continued the merchant.</p>

<p>'John,' replied the boy.</p>

<p>'John what, Sir?'</p>

<p>'John,' again repeated the lad.</p>

<p>'Well, what else beside John?'</p>

<p>'Do n't I tell you it is John?' said the boy, laughing.</p>

<p>'Do n't laugh, you young scoundrel!' said Mr. Tremlett, a little
out of patience.</p>

<p>'I can't help laughing, you talk so funny!' said the boy.</p>

<p>'Why, what an impudent little scamp!' exclaimed Mrs. Swazey,
who had just come in. 'Do n't you know who you are talking to?'</p>

<p>'No,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Well, if I ever heard such impudence!' exclaimed Mrs. Swazey.</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 322 -->

<p>'Do n't you know what your name is?' asked Mr. Tremlett.</p>

<p>'Do n't I say it's John?' answered the boy.</p>

<p>'Well, then, what is your father's name?'</p>

<p>'I do n't know what you mean!'</p>

<p>'Have you got no father?'</p>

<p>'I do n't know.'</p>

<p>'Have you got no mother?'</p>

<p>The boy shook his head, without making any other reply.</p>

<p>'Who took care of you?'</p>

<p>'The old devil,' replied master John, looking very serious.</p>

<p>'What an awful wretch!' exclaimed Mrs. Swazey, lifting up both
her hands.</p>

<p>'Who do you mean by the devil?' inquired the merchant.</p>

<p>'The old woman that used to feed us with mush and molasses,'
answered the lad.</p>

<p>'Oh! oh!' exclaimed Mrs. Swazey; 'a greater villain I never see,
in all <i>my</i> born days!'</p>

<p>'Where did you live?' asked Mr. Tremlett, smiling at his house-keeper's
consternation.</p>

<p>'Out to the 'sylum,' replied John.</p>

<p>'At the asylum!' said Mrs. Swazey; 'I declare, if he has n't called
the matron, Mrs. Ellkins&mdash;which is my most intimate acquaintance,
and the widow of Captain Timothy Ellkins, a highly respectable
India ship-master, and a very warm friend of my husband's when he
was alive&mdash;by that awful name! Take that for your impudence!'
said the house-keeper, giving the youngster a cuff on the side of his
head, which sent him against Mr. Tremlett's chair.</p>

<p>But master John soon recovered himself, and without the least
hesitation, caught hold of Mrs. Swazey's apron, and administered her
such a kick, that she fairly screamed with the pain. Mr. Tremlett
covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief, and in endeavoring to
suppress a hearty laugh, came near strangling. Mrs. Swazey hobbled
out of the room, brim full of indignation and mortified vanity; but
the lad preserved a wonderful composure of countenance.</p>

<p>Now that spirited feat of our hero's did more toward establishing
him in the affectious of Mr. Tremlett, than a whole year of the most
servile obedience would have accomplished. The truth was, the
house-keeper had held her situation so long, that she exercised an
authority over her employer which he found extremely annoying;
and yet he did not know how to resist it, he had so gradually yielded
to it; and he was gratified to see her so summarily punished for her
impertinent interference. As soon as he regained his gravity of countenance,
he resumed his examination.</p>

<p>'How came you to be out of the asylum?'</p>

<p>'Because I run'd away,' replied John.</p>

<p>'Ah, you are a very wicked boy,' said Mr. Tremlett. 'Do you
not know that I could send you to jail, for attempting to steal my
pocket handkerchief?'</p>

<p>'A man told me to,' replied the boy, his eyes filling with tears, as
he spoke, with a trembling under lip.</p>

<p>'What man was it?' asked Mr. Tremlett, a little softened in his
manner.</p>

<p>'I do n't know,' replied the boy; 'he was a great big man, almost

<!-- vol 14 page 323 -->

as big as you are; he told me if I would do it, he would give me a
penny.'</p>

<p>'Ah, he was a vile rascal,' said Mr. Tremlett; 'but you are a very
bad fellow yourself, and I shall be obliged to have you punished, and
kept in a place where you will be taken good care of, and instructed
to do justly.'</p>

<p>'I can say my prayers now,' replied master John; 'Our father
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy
will be done&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stop, stop!&mdash;not so fast!' interrupted Mr. Tremlett; 'you must
not pray in that manner.'</p>

<p>'Why? Can't God hear me if I pray quick?' said the youngster.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course; He would hear you, though you were only to
think your prayers; but I cannot keep the run of you, when you
speak so fast.'</p>

<p>'Ah; but I was not praying to you; you are not our Father who
art in heaven;' rejoined the lad, looking up seriously into the merchant's
face.</p>

<p>'Hush, hush!&mdash;you must not say such things,' said Mr. Tremlett,
looking very grave.</p>

<p>'Well, shall I say the commandments? I can say all the commandments,
and petitions, and 'fectual calling, just as easy as my
prayers,' said the youngster, exultingly.</p>

<p>'Not now,' replied Mr. Tremlett, 'not now; I am afraid you are
a very bad boy, and I must keep you here to-night, and send you
back to the asylum in the morning.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! oh no!' exclaimed the little fellow, in evident alarm; 'let me
stay here, in this asylum; I would rather live with you than with the
old devil out there.'</p>

<p>'You must not use such words before me, Sir, or I shall pull your
ears. Why do you call Mrs. Ellkins the old devil?'</p>

<p>'All the boys called her so,' he replied; 'and shall I tell you what
they called the old cook?'</p>

<p>'No, no,' said Mr. Tremlett; 'but tell me where you would sleep
to-night, if I should let you go.'</p>

<p>'Up here in a fish-car, in the market,' replied the boy; 'I have got
a good bundle of weekly Whigs and Eras for a pillow.'</p>

<p>'Well, well; I am glad weakly whigs can be put to such good use,'
said Mr. Tremlett, laughing; and master John laughed too, from
sympathy, although he did not exactly understand the brilliant pun
of the merchant, who was a rabid politician.</p>

<p>'I like you,' said the boy, leaning familiarly upon Mr. Tremlett's
knee, and looking up fondly into his face.</p>

<p>'Why, what do you like me for?' inquired Mr. Tremlett, while a
keen thrill of delight made his heart beat quick in his bosom.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, and before the boy could make a reply, a loud
knock was heard at the street door, and the servant showed in two
gentlemen, who had called upon Mr. Tremlett on business. So he
delivered the boy into the hands of Mrs. Swazey, with instructions
to have him well taken care of for the night. It was an unnecessary
caution to the kind-hearted house-keeper; for, notwithstanding she
heaped upon his head an undue amount of wordy severity, as soon

<!-- vol 14 page 324 -->

as she got our hero under her exclusive jurisdiction, and said she
could hardly keep her hands from off him, yet she manifested all a
woman's tenderness in providing for his comforts. And before she
retired to her chamber, she stole quietly into the room where he was
sleeping, and gently drew the coverlid over him, from which he had
extricated himself in his sleep. She stood for a moment to look upon
his beautiful face, and she would have kissed his rosy lips, had she
not been afraid that it would awaken him. And he slept on, unconscious
that a gentle being was watching over him, and regarding him
with looks of tenderness and pity. And thus we move through the
world, all unaware that the good angels of God are watching over
us, and shielding us from the thousand evils which continually surround
and threaten us. Here endeth the second chapter.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>TIME'S TRACKS.</p>

</div>

<p>GENTLE READER: I would not willingly lead you into error, and
therefore I will honestly confess, that the title which I have given to
this Gimcrack has no more connexion with its subject than the name
of a boy has with his character. But essays must have names, as well
as men and towns; and if any of my ingenious readers should feel
dissatisfied with the title of this article, he may address me on the
subject through the post-office, and when I collect my 'works' for
publication in another form, I will adopt any other name that may be
suggested to me.</p>

<p>Lord Brougham has very justly defined true greatness to consist of
being in advance of one's time; and the poets and philosophers who
have found most favor with the world, are those who have been mindful
of this plain truth; and taking heed to the injunction of Saint
Paul, have left the things that were behind, and have reached forward
to those things which are before; while we have lately seen an
instance of the ill effects of neglecting this wise course, in the failure
of a great poet in a neighboring city, who, in the choice of his subject,
went back to the days of the antediluvians. With such a melancholy
instance of misapplied genius before my eyes, it would be
little less than literary suicide, were I to seek in history for the
materials wherewith to season the <i>entremets</i> that I have undertaken to
serve up for the guests who sit at OLD KNICK.'S table. I shall therefore
make a long arm, and reach forward into the dominions of posterity,
and gather up such crumbs as come within the reach of my
fingers.</p>

<p>So&mdash;what is this? Nothing short of a newspaper. That was a
lucky grab. We will now see what our descendants are doing.</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> a long arm that I put forth, beyond dispute. It appears
I have reached into that distant period when the friends of human
rights have carried their plans beyond the wildest dreams of the present
day. Women enjoy the same privileges as men; servants are
unknown, and all government at an end; and such is the perfect
equality of mankind, that the strong tyrannize over the weak
with impunity, since there are no legal restraints to hinder, and the hardest
fends off. But still the world is improving, and the inmates of the
nursery are contending for their rights. The paper that I have
grasped in my hand is the 'MINORS' MIRROR,' and is edited by an
association of infants. It differs but little from many of the papers
of the present day, except that the paper is of a finer texture, and the
typography is greatly superior to any thing seen in this generation.
The first article on the outside page is headed 'WALL-STREET,' and
is of course devoted to that endless subject, the currency. The next
is headed 'TRADE,' and as there appears to be some novelty in the
editor's remarks, I will indulge the reader with a quotation:</p>

<p>'Trade, during the past week, has been unusually dull; shop-keepers

<!-- vol 14 page 426 -->

make great complaints of a falling off in the demand for some
articles which are usually, at this season, in request. A dealer in
marbles states, that since the annual meeting of the juveniles, his
sales have fallen off one third; cocoa-nut cakes, however, are in
some request, and we have heard of a sale as high as twelve for a
shilling; pea-nut candy is freely offered at a penny, and holders appear
extremely desirous of sales; hard boiled eggs remain as they
were, but ginger beer is decidedly lively; crullers and dough-nuts are
firm at quotations; molasses candy has experienced a still farther decline.
The old lady who keeps a stand in Broadway, near what was
once Maiden-lane, effected a considerable sale yesterday afternoon of
mint-sticks, but the terms have not yet transpired. As the holidays
are approaching, we may confidently look for a return of former
prices; and as the quarterly allowances to boys under twelve years
will then become due, a considerable amount of pennies will be
thrown into circulation, which cannot but have a favorable influence
on the dealers in tin trumpets, a branch of industry which, we are
sorry to learn, is laboring under great depression.'</p>

<p>Next follows a column of miscellaneous items, from which the following
are selected:</p>

<p>'ANCIENT SPORTS.&mdash;We are always happy to remark any thing
like a return to the simple habits and tastes of our ancestors; for although
we are strenuous advocates for improvement, it must be allowed
that our progenitors excelled in certain acts of <i>bon hommie</i>, of
which we are miserably deficient. Considerable excitement was
yesterday occasioned, and no small amusement, by a revival of the
ancient custom of dancing for eels in Catharine Market. The performers
were two black gentlemen, and the prize was a large bunch
of splits: the winner's name was Jinquez, a descendant of that famous
prince who landed on our shores above two centuries since. After
the dance was over, the spectators adjourned to the Spread Eagle
Tavern, where they were regaled with oyster-soup, served up in the
old style, with pepper-corns and alspice.'</p>

<p>'A deputation of boys waited upon the mayor last evening, to demand
satisfaction for an affront put upon a child by the name of Epenetus
Eglintoun, by one of the aldermen of the forty-eighth ward.
The facts of the case, as we gather from the chairman of the deputation,
are these: as Master Epenetus was trundling his hoop down
the Eighty-fourth Avenue, in the quiet enjoyment of his rights, he
chanced to run butt against the legs of Alderman Sopht Soaph, doing
no other damage to the city dignitary, than slightly lacerating one of
his rather exuberant calves; and for this trifling offence, he had the
unparalleled audacity to pull the boy's ears. As soon as the matter
became known, a tremendous excitement was the consequence; a
meeting was called, at which the most enthusiastic speeches were
made, and several very severe resolutions were passed, without a
dissenting voice. A committee was immediately appointed, who
waited upon the mayor, and demanded the instant removal of the
offender. One of the committee was the alderman's youngest son,
who was very loud in his denunciations of his father. We have not
yet heard the nature of the mayor's reply, but as soon as it is received,
an extra will be issued from this office.'</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 427 -->

<p>'HIGHLY INTERESTING.&mdash;A very full meeting of young gentlemen
under the age of ten years, took place last night in Young Lion's
Hall, to receive the report of the committee appointed to inquire
into the expediency of abolishing leading-strings from the nursery.
The fifth resolution was offered by Washington Adams, and seconded
by Jenkins Thomson, in a speech of great power; the thrillingness of
the interest excited, was of the most intense kind. The resolution was
to this effect:</p>

<p>'RESOLVED, That in the opinion of this meeting, leading-strings are
a relic of the barbarous customs of our barbarous ancestors, and that
we are bound by every principle of honor and liberty to wage an
exterminating war against them, and that we will do so.'</p>

<p>'Thir,' said Mr. Adams, 'Mither Prethident, in rithing to thecund
thith motion, I feel my bothom thwelling, with thoze pecooliar emothions
which gwate men have all felt on gwate occathions. Thir,
when I look abroad into that animated nature tho beautifully desthwibed
by the immortal Goldthmith, I look in wain for leading-strings.
Which of the animals in all kweation leadth ith young by
stwings? Do birds? do fisheth? do therpenth? No, Mither Prethident,
no. It ith man alone that pwesumes to lead ith young with
stwingth! Thir, thothiety has much to unlearn, ath well ath to learn,
before mankind can be resthored to ith owiginal wights. I wepeat
onth more, it ith time that thith odioth awithtocwatic obthervance
wath abolished.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Adams, after enchaining his auditory for the space of an hour,
with the soundest views, expressed in the most thrilling words, sat
down amid tremendous cheering. But silence was no sooner restored,
than it was immediately broken by a great overgrown man, with a
pair of bushy whiskers, and a gruff voice, who had the audacity to
address the president in the following manner: 'It strikes me, Mr.
President, that the little gentleman who last spoke, is suffering very
severely from that juvenile complaint called <i>the lispth</i>.' It is needless
to add, that the intruder was answered by the most scornful silence.'</p>

<p>On the last page of the paper, the editor delivers himself of the
following curious observations in his notices to correspondents:</p>

<p>'An opinion appears to be current in society, that the publisher of
a newspaper is bound to print all the communications that he may
receive on any subject, whether the sentiments that they contain be
congenial with his own, or not; but such is not the view that we take
of the matter. Although we live in an age when a man has a right
to do wrong, so free is human will, yet we are not so far advanced in
freedom, that a man can be compelled to do wrong to himself, to
oblige another. That day may arrive, but it has not yet. We wish
that these remarks may be considered by the writers of poetry, of all
kinds, as intended expressly for them; and in an especial manner,
for the translators of German doggerel. These latter gentlemen
seem to think that as the art of printing is of German origin, the
whole force of the press should be devoted to villanous translations
of incomprehensible verses out of that language. We have now on
hand several large baskets, full of Germanic verses, besides an innumerable
number of essays on the genius of Goethe. The worst of it
is, that these things are written by children, whose time and talents
might be devoted to better purposes.</p>

<!-- vol 14 page 428 -->

<p>'From the above remarks, 'G. B.,' 'Philo Novalis,' 'P. T.,' and a
score of others, will learn the reason why their effusions have not
been printed in our columns. But to show our willingness to yield
to the spirit of the age, we will print one of these communications;
and that we may not be accused of partiality, we dip our hand into a
basket, and here is the first paper that we caught; but it shall be the
last:</p>

<p>One department of the 'Minors' Mirror' is devoted to reviews of
new books; and, judging from the number under notice, authors
must have increased at a fearful rate. Indeed, the editors express an
opinion, that were it not contrary to the spirit of the age, they should
propose a law making it a capital offence for any publisher to issue a
work written by a child under ten years of age. The art of criticism
appears to have attained to great perfection with our descendants, as
will appear from the following remarks:</p>

<p>'We have this week received sixteen hundred and eighty-five new
books, of which:</p>

<p>'Three hundred and ten are theological, and consequently either
above or below criticism.</p>

<p>'Ten hundred and ninety are tales and novels, and are all without
exception most atrociously vile; but not withstanding their utter want
of merit, we should notice them at greater length, did not each one of
them contain that immaculate word, GLORIOUS. We have long since
given notice, that we will not review a work in which it appears.</p>

<p>'One hundred and forty are historical works, and being as usual full
of lies, are not of a character to merit a more particular notice.</p>

<p>'Forty-five are essays on the characters in SHAKSPEARE's plays, and
are calculated to excite some astonishment in the minds of readers,
as they furnish abundant proof that there are forty-five persons in this
enlightened age, incapable of appreciating the great genius of the
only dramatic poet that the world has yet known.</p>

<p>'Seventy-five are essays on the genius of GOETHE; but as we are
among those who deny that the libidinous old scribbler had any particular
genius, it cannot be expected that we should waste our time
in noticing the rigmarole of those who maintain a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>'Twenty are on the subject of an International Copy-right. As a
celebrated philosopher has predicted that the millennium is near at hand,
perhaps there is a possibility of the claims of authors receiving
some attention from those who are most indebted to them.</p>

<p>'Three are metaphysical; and all that we have to remark in reference
to them, is, that we perceive balderdash has not yet had its day.</p>

<p>'One is on chemical affinities; but as the author has filled the greater
part of his book with a preface, in which be traduces a score or
two of most excellent names, we shall say nothing more in relation
to it.</p>

<p>'One is an essay on architecture, and right welcome would it be, if
it contained one new idea, or even one just old one, on the subject of
which it professes to treat; but as it does not, we pass it by.</p>

<p>'We have also a monstrous heap of new periodicals at our elbow,
but as we do not find any thing in them commendatory of ourselves,
we have nothing favorable to say of them.'</p>

<p>Some of the advertisements are very curious. A bookseller in Nassau-street
announces a work in press, under the superintendence of
the Antiquarian Society, giving a faithful account of the rise and
overthrow of the sect of STRIPED PIGS; but by far the largest number
of advertisements are of confectionary articles, paper kites, colored
marbles, tee-to-tums, and other articles suited to the wants of the readers
of the paper.</p>

<p>A RIDE IN AN OMNIBUS.</p>

</div>

<p>HOWEVER improbable the assertion may appear to the Broadway
belles and the Bowery boys, it is nevertheless unquestionably true,
that there are many men and women in the world, who have never
travelled in an omnibus. I am aware that the very name of the vehicle
seems to imply that they carry all the world; but still it must be
regarded as a mere figure of speech, and not taken in its literal sense.
In Cockaigne, where the carriage and its name both had their origin,
the impropriety of the OMNI has long since been acknowledged, and
the citizens of that classic land make use of the BUSS only; and it is
a matter of some wonder, that our travelled countrymen have not
introduced the improvement here. Taking it for granted, then, that
there are, even among the distant readers of the KNICKERBOCKER,
some who have never enjoyed the luxury of a ride down Broadway,
in one of these convenient vehicles, I design, in this present writing,
to narrate, for their especial benefit, some of the pleasures
of that delightful manner of travelling.</p>

<p>It was near the close of a warm afternoon in the decline of summer,
that I emerged out of one of the elegant streets in the upper
part of the city of New-York, and stepped upon the newly-laid flagging
of Broadway, just as a long white carriage, drawn by four horses
of as many different colors, and with a figure of Minerva painted
upon its central pannel, started for a little spot of verdure at the
lower end of the city, called, by way of a joke, the 'Bowling Green.'
The driver of the vehicle, raising himself in his seat, gave a preliminary
flourish with his whip, and looking behind him, caught sight
of my weary-looking limbs, and gave me an invitation to ride, by
making a peculiar sweep with his uplifted elbow; I answered the
invitation by lifting up my fore finger, upon which he checked his
horses, and I entered the carriage, and found that it contained no one but
an elderly lady, opposite whom I sat down. Our driver was a tall,
thin young man, with a whitish hat upon his head, and a cigar in his
mouth. His whole dress was in admirable keeping&mdash;a perfect study
for MOUNT, the genius of Stoney Brook; and there was a reckless
glance in his eye, that would have well become the ambitious Phaeton,
the day on which he set fire to the world by his careless driving.</p>

<p>We jogged along at an easy rate, passing the white towers of the
University on our left, and the square stone tower of the Church of
the Messiah on our right; and leaving the beautiful granite church,
with a marble altar and a wooden steeple, and numerous other architectural
wonders, behind us. But suddenly there came dashing along
behind us an opposition line, from the neighborhood of Union Square,
as that tasteful oval is called. The carriage was a deep crimson,
with a great profusion of gilding; and was drawn by four mettlesome
bay horses. The driver was a buckish-looking individual, with a

<!-- vol 14 page 543 -->

glossy black hat, and a bob-tailed green coat. He also had a newly-lighted
cigar in his mouth, and altogether his appearance was saucy
in the extreme. He was about to dash past us, without the smallest
acknowledgment of our existence, when our driver gave a sudden
crack with his whip, and started his cattle into a pretty brisk trot;
for drivers of omnibusses, like drivers of quills and bargains, do not
like to be distanced in a race with a rival; and therefore it was quite
natural that he should make a freer use of his whip than he before
had done.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, a couple of young ladies stopped on the crossing,
and motioned our driver to stop; but without giving the slightest
heed to their wishes, he gave a loose to his reins, and contrived, by
a free use of his whip, and an incessant ejaculation of crack phrases,
which are presumed to be very gratifying to horses, to keep up the
speed of his divers-colored cattle. At the first bound of the omnibus,
I found myself plump in the lap of the lady passenger, who seemed
disposed to take my sudden intrusion upon her premises as no joke;
but scarcely was I seated on my own side again, than another sudden
bound sent the lady herself quite as suddenly into my arms. We
were now square on the score of visits; so she regained her good
humor as soon as circumstances would allow, and said something very
'smart;' but I could not understand a syllable of it.</p>

<p>We dashed along at a fearful rate; and as I saw lamp-posts and
granite columns flying past in great confusion, I began to have serious
apprehensions that I should never reach Bowling-Green with a whole
skin; and as disagreeable thoughts always intrude themselves exactly
at the wrong time, my anxiety was increased by remembering that I
had neglected to renew the policy on my life, by paying the annual
premium.</p>

<p>'Alas! alas! my poor boy!' I exclaimed, 'who will provide for
you and my dear Mary, when I am gone!'</p>

<p>But thoughts like these could not occupy my mind long; for our
situation was momently becoming intensely exciting.</p>

<p>'A stern chase is a long chase,' is an old saying with sailors; and I
see no reason why it should not come to be a proverb among omnibus
drivers. Our present case certainly afforded a very pretty illustration
of its truth. We were decidedly inferior to our consort in
point of metal; but having the lead, we continued to keep it without
very great difficulty. On which ever side he might endeavor to pass,
our driver would very adroitly prevent him, by heading his horses
directly across his path. Fortunately, there is a city ordinance against
driving omnibusses on the side-walk, or we might have been compelled
to submit to a defeat. Every now and then the heads of the 'leaders'
of the opposition would intrude themselves into the door of our omnibus,
and giving a disdainful toss, would half cover us with foam.
Then the lady would shriek, the horses would snort, the drivers
would swear, crack would go their whips, crash would go something,
and away we would fly again. Rows of brick houses rushed past, as
though they were reeled off; Saint Thomas' church, with his two
gray towers, and his shingle roof, walked by like a 'sober second
thought;' and Niblo's Garden, with its gingerbread grottoes, and
dirty finery, rushed away like a feverish dream. I forgot all my

<!-- vol 14 page 544 -->

fears, now, and thought only of victory. Indeed, I should have
valued a broken arm no more than the paring of a finger-nail. I was
afraid of nothing but defeat. In the height of my anxiety, I put my
head out of the window, and shouted to the driver to crack on; and
the lady, who had turned pale with fright when we first set out, was
now flushed with excitement, and she clapped her hands together in
high glee, every time we got an advantage over our pursuer. Suddenly
I heard a crash and a shout, and turning my head, I saw two
well-dressed gentlemen sprawling in the middle of the street, and a
pair of grays flying away with a half-demolished dearborn-wagon.
Men, I thought, had no business to venture themselves in Broadway
in such slight things; and probably so thought our driver, for he
never turned his head to see what damage he had done, but continued
to urge on his horses at the top of their speed.</p>

<p>That brick-and-wood monster, the Lyceum, was out of sight behind
us, and still we dashed on, a full omnibus-length ahead of our
chase. Grand-street was gained, and for a moment the pinions of
Victory fluttered, as if she were hesitating upon whose head to alight.
It was but a short space of time, but it was long enough for a doubt.
Charles the Twelfth at Bender, or Wellington at Waterloo, may have
experienced something like the peculiar sensations that we did at this
moment. The new church, close by, rising like a monstrous heap of
snow from the dingy pavement, looked as though it was blanched with
apprehension. But doubt was soon removed; and away we dashed
again, the driver of the opposition gnashing his teeth with rage
at having lost an opportunity of distancing us.</p>

<p>Thinking with Doctor Johnson, that when a historian fails to make
record of a generous action that may have been performed by one of
his characters, that the world is defrauded of its rightful fare, I will
relate the cause of our almost defeat at the corner of Grand-street.
A near-sighted old market woman was crossing the street with a basket
of Newtown pippins on her brawny arm, when an overgrown
porker, whose speed had been quickened by a crack from our driver's
whip, ran full bolt between her legs, laid her sprawling upon her
back, and sent her basket of pippins flying to the four corners of the
two streets. Whether it was that our driver remembered that he
had an old mother at home, or that some other kindly feeling influenced
him, I know not; but, in the most humane manner, he turned his
horses' heads a little one side, just sufficient to graze the prostrate
lady's petticoat, thus giving his rival a decided advantage; as he might,
by driving directly over her, have distanced us by at least half the
length of the omnibus. I do not remember to have seen any public
acknowledgment of this noble act of generosity; but I trust that those
public-spirited individuals who get up 'benefits' for meritorious dancing-masters,
and other public benefactors, will not allow this gallant
omnibus-driver to go unrewarded. Perhaps a complimentary omnibus-benefit-ride,
from the Battery to Seventeenth-street, would be as
suitable a way as could be suggested, to testify the public respect,
and aid the chivalrous beneficiary.</p>

<p>If my feelings were excited before, they reached their calenture
now. The humanity of our driver had enlisted my sympathies
strongly in his behalf, while the ferocious looks and profane expressions

<!-- vol 14 page 545 -->

of the opposition, caused me to exult in his defeat. Away we
flew like lightning, and gained the next corner without doing any
other damage than overturning the oyster-stand of a one-legged old
sailor, who appeared to regard his loss of a few oysters, and a bottle
of red peppers, with a degree of chagrin which I thought was greatly
disproportioned to the occasion. At last, we reached Canal-street,
where we had a passing glance of the romantic hills of Weehawken,
and a gorgeous pile of snowy clouds rising above the green fields of
New-Jersey, and just tinged with the beautiful hues of the descending
sun. I looked upon the bright vision as an omen of success; and
something was wanting to sustain our spirits, for the space on which
we had now entered being wider than any that we had passed before,
afforded a better chance for our pursuer to avail himself of his superior
bottom; but the greater number of pedestrians that we here
encountered, in a great measure neutralized the advantage.</p>

<p>The blackened walls of the Church of the Ascension, the aspiring
liberty-pole of the Conservatives, and the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of the hygeian college,
all might have attracted my attention at any other time; but now,
they were unheeded. Our passage across this area was extremely
critical; for notwithstanding our driver did all that could be done
with his whip and his tongue, our rival gained upon us at every step;
and just as we had abandoned all hope, one of Kip and Brown's blood-red
omnibuses, with a full load, came dashing up Broadway, and
saved me from defeat, by running so close to the opposition, as to
nearly upset him. But all three omnibusses meeting at the same moment,
together with a charcoal wagon, two butchers' carts, a buggy,
and two private carriages with out-riders, caused considerable scampering
among the foot passengers. A terribly shrill cry suddenly
pierced our ears.</p>

<p>'O! heavens!' exclaimed my companion, 'what can it be!'</p>

<p>'It is nothing but a child,' I replied, as I saw a young lady haul
something white from under the wheels of a butcher's cart, and press
it to her bosom. But a second look enabled me to say, 'It is only a
Spanish poodle,' just in time to save the lady from fainting, which
she had made preparation to do, by taking her pocket handkerchief
and smelling-bottle out of her pocket.</p>

<p>As we were fast approaching the end of our journey, the efforts of
the rivals increased in vigor. They hallooed, they swore, they cursed,
they stamped; they whipped their horses, and then brandished their
whips at each other; and if we did not increase, we certainly did not
diminish our speed; while the interest, if possible, grew more exciting
every moment. But soon a new difficulty arose. The lady
wanted to alight at Lispenard-street, but the driver was proof against
the admonitions of the check-string. The lady had no wish to travel
so far out of her way as Bowling Green, but the driver was too intent
on the race to allow a passenger to alight, and thereby give his antagonist
an opportunity of beating him. And I must confess that I
was highly delighted with his spirit; and forgetting, for the moment,
that I was a member of a temperance society, I determined to treat
him to a julep, so soon as we should reach the end of our journey.
The lady continued to tug away at the check-string, but the only reply
our gallant driver made was, 'No you don't!'&mdash;and by putting the

<!-- vol 14 page 546 -->

end of his thumb to his nose, and gently fanning the air with his extended
fingers; and then seizing his whip again, he made it crack
over the ears of his smoking leaders. The lady at last threw herself
back in despair, as we rattled past the little dusty hole called, in derision,
Contoit's Garden, and the great lumbering, greenish-brown pile
of bricks opposite, called, by way of an experiment in bombast, the
'Carlton House.'</p>

<p>And here we came well nigh being overturned, and dashed against
the curb-stone, in consequence of our driver suffering his attention to
be arrested by two flamingly-dressed young ladies, who winked at
him as they turned down into Leonard-street. Here we caught a
glimpse of several objects, each of which would require a separate
essay, if noticed properly: the Egyptian prison, the Church du St.
Esprit, the new library, and the ruined theatre; and the next moment,
we were opposite the noble hospital, happily built of good substantial
stone, before stuccoed walls and Grecian porticoes were in
fashion, standing in the midst of venerable trees, with green creepers
almost covering its sober front, and a neatly-trimmed lawn stretching
between it and the street&mdash;as bright as the greenest park in old
England&mdash;to gladden the eyes of the passers-by. A monstrous heap
of rubbish in the middle of the street once more endangered our lives
and limbs, and arrested the headway of our chase, who was fast
gaining upon us. Our driver gave a yell of delight and on we sped;
but my sympathies were somewhat excited, by observing that the
wheels of our omnibus threw a complete shower of black mud upon
the crimson mantilla of a very pretty woman, who had incautiously
ventured too near the curb-stone, at the corner of Duane-street; and
a little farther on, I perceived, on looking back, that the opposition
had overturned two porters, who were very carefully conveying a
large mirror on a hand-barrow across the street. Fortunately, neither
of them was killed, although the mirror was smashed into a greater
number of pieces than it would have been easy to enumerate. And
then we passed Clover's&mdash;where Linen's beautiful portraits of Clay
and Webster may be seen&mdash;in fine style, leaving our pursuer well behind
us. Of course, we were soon dashing past Washington Hall; and
at another time I should have regretted passing it in such haste, for it
presents a thousand times the finest fa&ccedil;ade of any building in Broadway,
from Battery Place to Union Square; and as there is a prospect
of its being speedily demolished, I love to look at it. Let me entreat
the architect of the contemplated theatre, whoever he may be, so to
arrange his plan, as to leave the present front entire.</p>

<p>And now we were careering it over the wooden pavements. What
a relief to our limbs, after rumbling a mile or two over dislocating
cobbles! And here are all the gayeties of the Park. The old Bridewell
is gone, and the pride of our noble city stands revealed in all
her beauty; and beautiful she is, in spite of the wooden abortion
which has been stuck upon her roof.</p>

<p>Chance now, as in many a renowned contest, must determine the
victory, for the crowd of carriages thickens fast. It is an easy matter
to overturn an old apple-woman, or even a dandy phaeton; but a
loaded dray presents an obstacle, that, like the will of the people,
must be respected. And here, too, are numerous pyramids of bricks,

<!-- vol 14 page 547 -->

which care no more for an omnibus than do the pyramids of the desert
for old Time, who has whetted his scythe upon them for a longer
period than men know of.</p>

<p>If oaths and curses could avail any thing, we should have been distanced
long since. The opposition has exhausted the swearer's vocabulary
a dozen times; but our gallant driver spurs on his cattle
with a good-natured hullaballoo, which contrasts favorably with the
savage ferocity of his rival. We catch a glimpse of time-honored Columbia
College, and its noble elms, and we are again on the cobbles.
Goodness, what a change! It is like laying down Tom Moore, and
taking up doctor M'Henry!</p>

<p>Crash! smash! The drivers swear, the horses plunge, the lady
screams; but there is no great damage, only one corner of the omnibus
torn off. Away we go, without heeding it. Here is our triumph!
All the world is looking at us. What a moment! We are almost a
length ahead of the opposition! Twenty dandies, with cigars in their
mouths, and small tufts of hair on their upper lips, are gazing at us
from the steps of the Astor House. A whole drove of little folks,
who have been treated to a sight of the wonders in Scudder's Museum,
clap their little hands with delight, as we rush past. All the
coachmen on the Park stand mount their boxes to look at us; and a
mettlesome gray horse, with a militia officer on his back, takes fright,
and scampers down Barclay-street, in fine style. Away we fly, past
St. Paul's Church, with our pursuer hard upon our heels, splashing
and dashing, slam-bang, and mingling with dirt-carts, oyster-carts,
and milk-wagons, until we get inextricably interlocked with a whole
caravan of brokers' and bankers' clerks, fleeing from Wall-street in
every possible description of vehicles. The horses blow hard, and
throw off steam like a locomotive. Our driver waxes moderate in the
use of his whip and his oaths. The excitement is fast cooling; and
after repeated struggles to get clear, we at last have the mortification
of seeing the opposition drive past us, and we reach Bowling Green
just two minutes after him.</p>

<p>After all, what is the use of striving to out-race our fellows in this
world? If we win, our spirits have all evaporated in the contest; and
if we lose, we have nothing but mortification for our exertions. With
such reflections, I stepped out of the omnibus, and left my fair fellow
traveller disputing with the driver about her fare; for she very justly
refused to pay for her ride down, unless he would agree to take her
back to the place of her destination, free of charge.</p>

<p>SIASCONSET: HOW IT AROSE, AND WHAT IT IS.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE are numerous lovely spots on this earth, which occupy a
large space in many hearts, although they make but an indifferent
appearance on the map of the great world; and there are many
names of places that would be looked for in vain in the chart of any
country, which nevertheless makes a conspicuous figure in the world
of letters. The name which graces the head of this paper belongs
to that class which lives only in the hearts of a few; but it shall be no
fault of mine, if it is not found hereafter on the printed page,
by the side of others better known to Fame, but not more entitled to regard
and remembrance.</p>

<p>Dear Siasconset! what a happy lot were mine, could I cause thy
name to live in the memories of those who treasure up in their hearts
images of the bright and beautiful, the lovely and the good, the great
and the noble! Year has followed year, like the constantly returning
waves that beat upon thy pebbly shore; the light laughter of youth
has grown faint and tremulous in age, and at last silent in death; the
slight herbage that fringes thy slighter soil, has sprung up and
decayed for succeeding seasons, since that mid-week of creation,
when God bade the earth bear fruit; and still the world knows not
of thy existence. But it shall be so no longer. That distant orb
which had been beaming in its sphere since that glorious morning
when the stars sang together for joy, never attracted the gaze of
mankind, until the keen-sighted Herschel took note of its existence,
and giving it the name of his sovereign, pointed it out to the wondering
eyes of the world. So, SIASCONSET! let me direct the
admiration of mankind to thy quiet hamlet, where it stands frowned
upon, but guarded, by Sancoty and Tom Nevers, the Gog and Magog
of the Ocean.</p>

<p>It is now one hundred and eighty years, since a kind-hearted and
generous man was compelled to flee from his new home, to escape a
fine and flagellation, for having been guilty of giving shelter to four
Quaker way-farers during a thunder storm. The name of this man was
Thomas Macy, and the place from which he fled was Salisbury,
in Massachusetts, where he had acquired a title to a tract of land
comprising one thousand acres, had built himself a house, and stocked
a farm. This being at that period of the world's existence which
we of the present generation look back upon with veneration, and
call the 'good old times;' and the whole land being under the immediate
control of those conscientious gentlemen, the Pilgrim Fathers;
and it being about the time when England's sublimest bard poured
forth that noble strain:</p>

<p class="small">'Avenge, O Lord! thy slaughtered saints, whose bones<br/>

Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,<br/>

Even those who kept thy truth so pure of old,<br/>

When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones;<br/>

Forget not; in thy book record their groans.'</p>

<!-- vol 15 page 183 -->

<p>it may be considered a strange matter, that a man should be scourged
and fined for giving a shelter beneath his roof to a weary traveller;
but such is the fact. In those primitive days, a good Christian was
hardly accounted <i>comme il faut</i>, unless he had either worried a witch,
or given a quietus to a Quaker; and Thomas Macy having done
neither, he was naturally looked upon with suspicion by his neighbors,
notwithstanding he had lived among them twenty years, without
giving any cause of offence, but that related above; after which,
however, either remorse of conscience, or the persecution of his
pious rulers, drove him from his home and possessions. Being first
arraigned for his offence, however, he put in the following plea in
extenuation, the original of which is still in existence:</p>

<p>'This is to entreat the honored court not to be offended because
of my non-appearance. It is not from my slighting the authority of
the honored court, nor fear to answer the case; but have been for
some weeks past very ill, and am so at present; and notwithstanding
my illness, yet I, desirous to appear, have done my utmost endeavors
to hire a horse, but cannot procure one at present. I, being at present
destitute, have endeavored to purchase one, but cannot at
present attain it; but I shall relate the truth of the case, as my answer
would be to the honored court; and more cannot be proved, nor
so much. On a rainy morning, there came to my house Edward
Wharton and three men more: the said Wharton spoke to me, saying
that they were travelling eastward, and desired me to direct them in
the way to Hampton; and never saw any of the men afore, except
Wharton, neither did I inquire their names, or what they were; but
by their carriage, I thought they might be Quakers, and said I so;
and therefore desired them to pass on in their way; saying to them,
I might possibly give offence in entertaining them; and soon as the
violence of the rain ceased, (for it rained hard,) they went away, and
I never saw them since. The time that they staid in the house was
about three quarters of an hour; they spoke not many words, in the
time, neither was I at leisure to talk with them; for I came home
wet to the skin, immediately afore they came to the house, and I found
my wife sick in bed. If this satisfy not the honored court, I shall
submit to their sentence. I have not willingly offended. I am ready
to serve and obey you in the Lord. Thomas Macy.'</p>

<p>'27 <i>of</i> 8<i>th mo</i>., '59.'</p>

<p>But this did not satisfy the 'honored court;' and therefore he
was forced to flee; and two of the men who had caused him to offend,
by seeking a shelter beneath his roof, viz: William Robinson,
merchant of London, and Marmaduke Stephenson, of Yorkshire,
England, were hanged in Boston the same year, for being Quakers.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that Thomas Macy was suspicious of
the whole race of white folks, as well he might be; and he determined
to remove himself and family as far from their influence as he could.
He put his wife and little ones, together with such of his effects as
he could carry upon his shoulders, into an open boat, and having persuaded
a neighbor to accompany him, he launched his frail vessel,
and set sail in quest of a place where Christian men had not intruded
themselves. He coasted along the barren shore of Cape Cod, past the
Elizabeth Islands, and Martha's Vineyard, so called from its abounding

<!-- vol 15 page 184 -->

in herrings, until he reached a little heap of arid sand, just lifting
itself above the surface of the waters, and surrounded on every side
by dangerous shoals and sand-bars, as if nature, in her kindness, had
determined that no rash individual should set foot upon a spot that
she was evidently ashamed of. But these things, which might have
daunted a fainter hearted man than Thomas Macy, were only inducements
to him to set up his Ebenezer in this place. For he doubtless
thought that in this spot he and his descendants would be free
from intrusion, to the end of time; unless some guilty, outlawed
wretch like himself, who had given shelter to the houseless and oppressed,
should seek its desert shore for an asylum, when pursued by
the conscientious and over pious. This little heap of sand has since
been called Nantucket, and from this true-hearted and brave man
sprang up just such a race of men and women as one might suppose
such a stock capable of producing; kind-hearted, generous, careful,
brave and enterprising, but withal greatly inclined to peace; thrifty
and prudent, and at the same time hospitable to a proverb.</p>

<p>Thomas Macy afterward returned to Salisbury, and brought back
with him to Nantucket several families, among whom were the ancestor
of Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, and the maternal ancestor of
Doctor Franklin. They found the island peopled with savages, who
suffered the new comers to take up their abode there without molesting
them; and the white intruders in return treated the hospitable
natives with uniform kindness and gentleness; a mode of proceeding
which was found much more efficacious in exterminating them,
than hunting them with blood-hounds, or shooting them with patent
rifles. They were literally killed with kindness. If this method of
exterminating natives was but known and practised in the everglades
of Florida, a very large sum of money might be annually saved by
our government. But let me not wander from my subject.</p>

<p>Psychological peculiarities are more enduring than physiological.
The lineaments of an entire race may change, while their moral features
remain unaltered. Whether the descendants of Thomas Macy
bear any resemblance in their outward seeming to their progenitor,
cannot now be known; but certain it is, the leading points in their
characters are singularly like to his. Driven by a barren soil and an isolated
situation to draw their subsistence from the ocean, they became
early accustomed to its perils, and to love its dangers; and leaving
the smaller of the finny tribe to the less adventurous spirits of Cape
Cod and Cape Ann, they grappled with the huge leviathan of the
deep, and have ever since made the capture of him the leading pursuit
of their lives; and now, in whatever part of the globe, how remote
soever it may be from their island home, no sooner does the
black-coated monster of the deep thrust his head above its surface,
than one of the descendants of Thomas Macy stands ready in
the bow of his fragile skiff, with harpoon in hand to fasten upon his prey.
Such was the commencement of Nantucket; and more than half a
century ago, colonies from that little spot had settled down in Dunkerque
in France, Milford Haven in Wales, Halifax in Nova Scotia,
New-Bedford in Massachusetts, and Hudson in our own state, for the
purpose of carrying on the business of catching whales; and by their
descendants it is continued to this day. The immediate descendants

<!-- vol 15 page 185 -->

of the first settlers of Nantucket not only supplied this continent with
oil before the revolution, but they exported large quantities to
England and France. In the latter country, they were the first to
introduce it into use, being obliged to create a demand, in order to
meet it. It is related, in an authentic history, that some persons standing
on a high hill on the island, watching the whales spouting and
sporting with each other, one said: 'There,' pointing to the sea, 'is a
green pasture, where our children's grand-children will go for bread.'
The prophecy has been literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Although all men are gregarious, and above all, civilized men, yet
in proportion as they become civilized, they strive to appear other
than what they are, by affecting to live apart from their own species.
It is to this feeling that country-seats and watering-places
owe their existence. And although men pretend to wish to be
very exclusive in their retreats from what they call the bustle of the
great world, yet they are very certain to go, on such occasions, where
there is the greatest probability of finding the greatest crowd; so
impossible is it for men to sin against their own natures. The simple
inhabitants of Nantucket, although differing essentially from the rest
of mankind in many particulars, partook of this common foible with
the rest. As they grew rich and refined, they felt the want of a
summer retreat; and in process of time, there were clustered together,
on the eastern end of the island, sixty or seventy little houses,
standing on the edge of a high cliff, with the waves of the Atlantic
constantly dashing against its base.</p>

<p>This was SIASCONSET. But how unlike all other summer retreats
and watering-places! It rises in the midst of ocean, with neither a green
tree nor a towering rock to divide the attention, or to entice the eye
from contemplating the grandeur of the wild waste of waters spread
out around it. The hoarse roar of the breakers continually dashing
against the shore, makes a nobler symphony than was ever heard
within the walls of a cathedral, and awakening within the soul a vague
feeling of sublimity, rebukes and puts to fight all mean and trivial
thoughts. One of those wooden gimcracks, with its Grecian porticoes
and Venetian blinds, that disfigure all other places of summer
resort in the twenty-four states, would look like an impertinence here;
and luckily no enterprising individual has yet seen proper to build
such an incubus upon the fair fame of Siasconset. The little houses
that are ranged along the cliff, with a green avenue running between
them, are the most modest and unpretending edifices that civilized
men ever reared for their accommodation. And here may be seen
and felt all those gentle graces which adorn and distinguish cultivated
minds, without any of those external affectations and incumbrances,
which accompany them in other places. Pride and luxury
are exotics, that cannot take root where there is so little of the blandishments
of Nature, or the achievements of art, to distract the mind
from the contemplation of its Maker. And here, by common consent,
men and women throw aside all useless restraints and cold formalities,
and intermingle with each other like brethren appointed to one
common lot, and who are joint heirs to one heritage. Fashion here
loses her sway, and even women cease to acknowledge her as their
sovereign. That foul demon, the SPIRIT OF PARTY, has never yet

<!-- vol 15 page 186 -->

shed his baneful influences over Siasconset, and strait-coated Sectarianism
has never approached within sound of its breakers. The tinkling
of a piano has never been heard within its borders, and the hissing
of steam has never marred the hoarse melody of its waters. But
the hilarious music of happy hearts is often heard there, and the gentle
whispers of heart-subduing voices. And too often the thrilling cry
of drowning wretches has been borne on the midnight blast; for many
noble ships have been wrecked upon its rips, without one soul being
left to tell the story of their disaster. And the shore has not unfrequently
been lined with costly goods, and lifeless bodies, while the
vessel that once bore them has been entirely beaten to pieces and
swallowed up in a night. And once the waters around were crimsoned
with human blood, and the echoes of the solitary cliffs were
awakened by sounds never heard there before; the clashing of swords,
the reports of cannon, and the fierce cry of men engaged in mortal
combat. It was near the close of the last war, when the privateer
Neufch&agrave;tel, lying within a very short distance of the shore, was
attacked by the boats of the Endymion frigate. Of one hundred and
forty men, including the first lieutenant of the ship, that manned the
barges, only fourteen returned alive.</p>

<p>But the chief glory of Siasconset, and what serves to embalm it
in the memories of all those who visit it, is neither its solitary grandeur,
its unique customs, nor the charms of its society, but its fish. To
appreciate them, they must be eaten. To describe an elegant woman,
a beautiful picture, or a fine landscape, would be an easy task; but
to give a correct idea of a 'soused chowder,' would baffle the readiest
pen, or the warmest imagination. No doubt many lovers of good
things would think it a lucky chance if they could sip a cup of young
hyson with the moon's first cousin, his highness of china; or sup
with an unbreeched Gaucho, in the Banda Oriental, off a Pampa bull
roasted whole, and undivested of his hide and horns; or breakfast at
Mackinac on a lake trout, which they had watched dying and broiling
upon the hot embers in an Indian wigwam; or to dine at the Rocher
de Cancale, on <i>turbot &agrave; la cr&eacute;me</i>; or they may have feasted in
imagination with Didius Julianus, or with Varius Heliogabalus on
shrimps and sausages, cooked according to the receipt of the latter
emperor; or have partaken of one of the men-fed fish from the pond of
Vedius Pollio, at a <i>d&eacute;jeunner &agrave; la fourchette;</i> or have eaten cow-heel
in their dreams with Glaucus Lorrensis; I am persuaded that no one
who has ever eaten fried tongues and 'sounds' at Siasconset, can ever
long for any other dish, unless it be a codfish chowder, served up at
the same place. Indeed, if one were called upon to decide between
the two dishes, he would be placed in a most puzzling predicament;
it would be like asking a mother which of her children she would be
willing to give up. They pretend to make chowder in other parts
of the Bay State; and I have tasted a villanous compound, even on
the sea-coast of New Hampshire and Maine, that was dignified by
the name; but it was an insult to the noblest of the finny tribe to
serve one of them up in such style. Every body has read, or heard,
of the tragic end of the illustrious Vatel, who ran himself through
the body with his sword, because the sea-fish that he expected to serve
up for the dinner of his royal master did not arrive in season. And

<!-- vol 15 page 187 -->

doubtless many thoughtless people have looked upon the too sensitive
cook as a fool, or at best as having fallen a sacrifice to a false principle
of honor. But I could never look upon the martyrdom of the
unfortunate Frenchman in such a light. Taking it for granted that
the fish he expected was a cod, and that the dish he intended to make
of it was chowder, I do not see that any other method of expressing
his chagrin could have been adequate to the occasion. He certainly
did right to fall upon his sword. But how melancholy to reflect, that
while the heroic artist was breathing his last breath, whole cart loads
of <i>mar&eacute;e</i> were arriving from every sea-port in France, whence he had
ordered it for fear of disappointment. His feelings were no doubt
well understood and appreciated by his royal master; for Madame
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, in her letter to Madame Grignan, says he was much praised,
and his courage was lauded as well as blamed.</p>

<p>There are other kinds of fish, beside cod, caught at Siasconset;
but the sojourners at that fascinating spot, like the emperor Geta,
have their fish served up in alphabetical order; and it so happens
that they never get beyond the third letter. It would literally be
descending too far, to go below <i>c</i>. The chromatic scale of their
culinary conceptions cannot go beyond cod. But the charmed circle
of their appetite is by no means a narrow one. First comes chowder,
then fried tongues and sounds, then fried cheeks, next corned cod,
then boiled sounds, and lastly dried cod. Who would ever wish to
leave such a round of enjoyment! What were the lampreys of
Julius C&aelig;sar, compared with the cod-fish of Siasconset!</p>

<p>These delightful fish are taken with hook and line in boats, peculiarly
constructed for riding on the breakers, about a mile from the
shore. It requires great skill and address to land the boats safely on
the beach; and it frequently happens that they are swamped in the
attempt, and the fruits of a day's labor and peril are lost. But so accustomed
are the fishermen to diving in the surf, that it rarely happens
that one of them is drowned. In landing, as soon as the boat
touches the shore, the crew leap out, and catching her by the gunwales,
drag her up high and dry out of the reach of the returning
breaker. The fish are immediately thrown out upon the beach,
when some bare-footed urchin, or bare-armed damsel, without question
or hindrance, claps an eye and a hand upon the largest and finest
looking one of the fare, and darts up the steep bank with surprising
alacrity. The fish is cleaned and thrust into the pot which has been
hanging over the fire, with its pork and onions all in readiness, in an
incredible short space of time; and if you are a looker-on, you begin
to feel longings within you that would be wholly insupportable, were
it not for the prospect of their speedy gratification. The keen bracing
air; the pure limpid water; the exercise upon the beach; the
simple joyousness of all around you; all tend to whet up the appetite
to such a degree, that you feel that the coarsest food would be
eaten with the liveliest zest imaginable; but when the additional
stimulus of the aroma arising from a pot of chowder is given, your
appetite becomes a phrenzy, and you seize a spoon and abandon your
self to the gratification of your desires, with a recklessness and utter
regardlessness of the whole world, and every thing it contains, except
the tureen before you, which you can never feel at any other

<!-- vol 15 page 188 -->

place, nor upon any other occasion. When you leave Siasconset, it
is with regret: it becomes petrified in your memory; and although
you may have travelled the world over, you never forget that you have
been there; and when you are asked whether you have or not, you
promptly reply, 'yes,' and add that you mean to go there again.</p>

<p>These were the identical words that came rattling from the throat of
the rich and portly Walter Windmill, Esquire, the auctioneer. Every
body is a squire in these days, but above every body else rich auctioneers.
Mr. Windmill was a Falstaff in his profession; he had enormous jowls,
the most comical crispy hair conceivable, and a pair of the funniest
hazle eyes that ever an auctioneer was blessed with; but they were
entirely useless to him without the aid of a pair of gold-mounted spectacles,
and even with this aid the owner of them could not distinguish a
hawk from a hand-saw at any respectable distance. The occasion on
which the emphatic words above recorded were uttered was a sale of
wines, by catalogue and sample; and the gentleman whose name was
repeated with such unction by Mr. Windmill was ISAAC DEMIJOHN,
Esquire, a rich old grocer of Coenties Slip, who had breathed the
atmosphere of that favored spot ever since he came into this breathing
world. Isaac was very rich, rich enough, every body thought but
himself, and he enjoyed all the honors that belong to that happy condition.
Nobody, at least no poor body, ever had the audacity to call in
question the correctness of his opinion. All his sayings had an orphic
tendency; and his jokes were always sure to command an explosion of
mirth. This is one of the choicest blessings that wealth can bestow;
to know that your wit will be appreciated by discerning listeners, and
that should you chance, through forgetfulness, to tell a funny story a
second or third time, your auditor will kindly receive it as though he
had never heard it before. Isaac's sons were the greatest rakes about
town, and gave unquestionable evidence of ending their lives in an
alms-house: his daughters too, having been stinted in their education,
because their father was determined upon dying a rich man, were idle,
extravagant, and silly, and much sought after too. If one had a desire
to be completely wretched, he could not attain his object more surely
than by taking one of the Misses Demijohn to wife; and yet many
young gentlemen whose sole pursuit was happiness, paid them the most

<!-- vol 18 page 380 -->

assiduous attentions, with the hope of winning their favor. Such are
some of the blessings attached to riches.</p>

<p>Isaac was a first-rate judge of liquors. You would have thought he
held the destiny of all the states and territories in his hand, if you could
have seen with what profound deliberation he drew his proof-glass from
the bung-hole of a brandy-pipe and applied it to his plethoric lips; and
then with what a solemn shake of his head he intimated a forthcoming
veto on the quality of the liquor. You would have sworn that nothing
short of a constitutional scruple or a Virginia abstraction could induce
such a mighty caution. But Isaac never troubled his head with such
unprofitable articles as abstract ideas: the main question with him was
which of two brands would bear the most mixing; whether 'Pellevoisin'
or 'A. Seignette' would take the greatest quantity of pure spirits without
losing its flavor. This was an important point to decide; and the
deliberation with which Isaac considered the subject was undoubted
proof of his sincerity. He had scruples, beyond a question, conscientious
scruples too; for Isaac was a communicant in a fashionable Dutch
church, and he had frequently been called upon to hand round the plate
for missionary purposes. As the flavor of good wine will remain in the
cask long after its contents have been emptied, so will an odor of sanctity
hang about a man engaged in such pious pursuits, even when employed
about mere worldly matters. And no one who saw Isaac deliberating
over a pipe of brandy or a hogshead of molasses, and knew what a
lively interest he took in the welfare of the heathen, could doubt that
he had the good of souls at heart.</p>

<p>The day on which we introduced him to the notice of the reader he
had been engaged in tasting, smelling, and comparing an unusually
long catalogue of choice wines; and he no sooner seated himself on
one of the wooden benches in Mr. Windmill's auction-room, than a heavy
drowsiness came over him, which he tried in vain to shake off. Let
him change his position as he might, or open his eyes ever so wide, he
could not resist the disposition to slumber which overpowered him.
Sleep seemed to rain its influence upon him; and in spite of his anxiety
to bid, he was forced to yield to its resistless but gentle power, and be
borne off to the Land of Nod like a manacled slave. There he sat with
his catalogue and pencil in hand, his back against the wall, and his
head kept upright by his fat double chin, unable to move or speak a
word. His spirit had passed away from the spot in which his body
was located, and while all around were conscious of his corporeal
presence, he was not himself conscious of any thing that was passing
near him. In all save appearance he was like a skeleton at an Egyptian
feast. He had purposely placed himself in a corner where no one but
the auctioneer could see his motions; for he knew that when younger
grocers saw him bid upon a particular lot, they would try to out-bid
him, to show their superior judgment to the rest of the world. And
there he sat, every now and then nodding at the auctioneer, whose
imperfect vision did not allow him to discover that Isaac was stuck fast
in an apoplectic slumber; so he took all his nods for bids, and knocked
down to him some terrible hard bargains, that would have ruined the
credit of a younger grocer.</p>

<!-- vol 18 page 381 -->

<p>Who would have guessed that the soul which inhabited that happy-looking
corporation was then undergoing a probationary residence with
the troubled spirits in Tophet? So little of an index to the mind are
the outward developements of the person. Although Isaac was asleep
in the auction-room, he was wide awake in another place. Though he
was deaf to the winning voice of Mr. Windmill, he could not shut the
ears of his soul to a terrible voice that none heard but himself.</p>

<p>Lord! what an uncomfortable position a man is in when left alone
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with his conscience! But if it is terrible in a day-dream,
with the blessed light of day shining full upon you, and many voices
chattering around you, what must it be when one is lying with the cold
earth upon his breast, and dismal night-winds howling around his solitary
biding-place! It is too fearful for thought; and so it appeared to Isaac
Demijohn, Esq., while like a guilty coward he tried to shun his accuser,
but dared not offer a word in his own defence. Rich as he was, Mr.
Demijohn would have given all he was worth if some kind hand had
but touched him and delivered him from his troublesome condition.
But no one discovered that he was asleep, or a dozen hands would
instantly have been raised for his rescue; and the auctioneer rattled
away with his lubble, a-lubble, a-lubble, a-lubble, and a half, and a half,
and a half, af, af, af, as other men in other places will rattle away at
their various employments, wholly regardless and careless of the sufferings
and griefs of those around them.</p>

<p>But what could possibly disturb so respectable a person as Isaac
Demijohn, Esq.? He occupied a very elevated position in society; he
was a bank director, and a subscriber to all the charitable enterprises
of the day; he was looked up to by his neighbors, and when men spoke
of him in the street he was said to be 'as good as old wheat.' Yet in
spite of all these things Isaac would have sold himself for a sixpence.
A monstrous weight was lying upon his breast, compared with which
one of the granite pillars of the new Exchange were a feather; and yet,
oppressive though it was, it was only a <i>false</i> weight; and the spirits
that so troubled him were pure spirits; yes <i>pure spirits</i>, that he had
mixed with brandy. Where was the harm in that? He could always
aver with exact truth to his customers that he sold nothing but a <i>pure</i>
article. Then there were tares springing up all around him, choking
his path whithersoever he turned, and entangling his feet; but these
were <i>false</i> tares. How horribly he was beset by these things, which,
though they took no fixed shape, were so palpable and unquestionable
that he knew them at a glance; and furthermore, he knew them to be
his own. It never once occurred to him to shift them off upon some body
else.</p>

<p>After a while these passed away, and then a poor wretch came along
with suffering in his looks, and Isaac trembled at his cruel glances. It
was an unfortunate neighbor, from whom he had taken usury many
years before, and who had been in his grave a long time. What a
malicious creature he must be to bear malice so long! Close upon his
heels came a maddened multitude of wo-stricken beings, every one of
whom gave him a reproachful look, which seemed to say, 'But for you
we had been happy and blessed; it was you who sold us rum; it was

<!-- vol 18 page 382 -->

you who wasted our bodies and drugged our souls with sin and misery!'
Isaac, it should be known, had begun trade as a retailer. Lord! how
they grinned and chattered!&mdash;how they gnashed their teeth upon him!
What a dismal howling they set up, and how they glared upon him with
their red and swollen eyes! The sweat started in big drops upon his
forehead and rolled down his unconscious cheeks, which looked as red
and as jolly as though their proprietor were reclining upon a Sybarite's
bed of roses. As this miserable multitude gradually melted away into
the dim space whence they emerged, there came others, mute but
mournful beings, whose down-cast eyes and sad features were a thousand
times more harrowing to him than the noise of the excited and chattering
creatures who had just left him. These were unfortunates who had
appealed to him for help in their adversity, and whom he had refused
with hard words and abuse; widows, orphans, and cripples; the most
feeble of all feeble folk, whose very helplessness gave them now the
power of giants over him. 'O, if they were only to come to me again!'
thought Isaac; 'I would give them my last penny. Would n't I shell
out to them? I would give my coach-horses for the use of these lame
people, and my idle and profligate sons should labor for those wretched
women.' But they glided silently away, seeming to say, 'It is too late;
we are very happy now.'</p>

<p>And then Isaac was left all alone to his thoughts. How dreadfully
dark it was! How vast the empty space in which he hung! How
dreadful to be deserted, even by his tormenting persecutors, and left all
alone to the reproaches of his conscience! He tried to call for help,
but in vain. His voice was choked. Why did not the heathen for
whom he had given so much money come to his assistance? Why did
not the reverend doctor under whose preaching he had slept so many
Sundays come and speak a consolatory word in his ear? This was
more terrible than all, to be left alone in that black abyss of nothingness.
He could not endure it; and yet he did. 'O!' he said, 'is this the
end of all my speculating? Is it for this that I have toiled night and
day through a long life, and denied myself all the bright and pleasant
things that I saw around me?&mdash;the cheap luxury of doing good, and
all? Did I wrong those poor people only that my sons should squander
my earnings upon wantons and profligates, and that I might myself be
wretched at last? How exact I would be in my weights and measures,
if it were to do over again! How contentedly I would live upon a
mere crust and a cup of water rather than wrong a human being out
of a penny! And how devout I would be in my religious duties!
Instead of going to church in a coach, I would walk, that my coachman
might enjoy the blessed privileges of the Sabbath as well as myself; and
I would take the lowest seat, and give to the poor all that the velvet
cushions and gaudy furniture of my pew have cost!'</p>

<p>But now a cool breeze swept across his face, and he began to breathe
easier. The terrible load upon his chest grew lighter; and although
he heard strange noises ringing in his ear, they did not appeal with
such terrifying distinctness to his fears. 'After all,' thought Isaac, 'I
have only followed the example that was set me. I have been quite as
good as my neighbor. I <i>must</i> provide for my family. I pay my debts,

<!-- vol 18 page 383 -->

and others must do the same, or take the consequences. I do not see
why I should be bound to provide for all the poor devils in the world.
Let them take care of themselves, as I do. And as for walking to
church, when I can afford to ride, that's a doctrine that I won't subscribe
to.' Thus he began to comfort himself, as his breathing grew
freer; and instead of his short struggling respiration he fairly snored
aloud; and as he drew a good long breath from the depths of his capacious
chest, all the vile phantoms that had been harrowing his soul took
flight. It was a short respite, however; for the next moment he felt a
shock that sent the blood in a tumultuous current from his head into
the extremities of his body. Now he thought his time was indeed
come, and that the Enemy of Mankind had him fast in his clutches.</p>

<p>'Hallo! Isaac!' said Mr. Windmill, as he struck the grocer upon
his back; 'what! asleep?'</p>

<p>'Save me! save me!' exclaimed Mr. Demijohn, starting upon his feet.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;ho! ho! ho!' roared a multitude of voices.</p>

<p>'Where am I!&mdash;what have I been doing!' exclaimed the amazed
grocer. 'Has the sale commenced? Has lot forty-one been sold?'</p>

<p>'Lot forty-one been sold?' repeated the auctioneer; 'bless my
precious picture!&mdash;what a question that is for <i>you</i> to ask! Why you
bought it yourself, and two thirds of the catalogue beside.'</p>

<p>'I?&mdash;I bid two thirds of the catalogue? Sir, I have not bid at
all!' said Isaac.</p>

<p>And here, as the novel writers have it, an <i>eclaircissement</i> took place,
but not a settlement; for Isaac refused to take the wines that had been
knocked down to him, and Mr. Windmill forthwith commenced a suit
against him, which having been instituted only four years has not yet
been brought to a close; consequently we cannot at this time lay the
result before the reader. But as far as Mr. Demijohn himself is concerned
it is a matter of small moment how the affair may terminate, as
that respectable gentleman took his departure very suddenly from this
wicked world a few months after the events recorded in this essay
occurred; and the anxious reader may find his many virtues recorded
on a very tall marble pillar erected in the Honey-Suckle Cemetery, on
the banks of the Hudson, a few miles from the City Hall.</p>

<h3>THE TWO PLEDGES: THE KEPT AND THE BROKEN.</h3>

</div>

<p>IN the green, sunny, and secluded little town of New-Diep lived TEUNIS VAN DEUZER. Of
course he was born there, because all its inhabitants were born within its borders; a peculiarity
which probably belongs to no other town on the continent of the new world. TEUNIS was educated
in the family of a professional house-carpenter, and it is believed that he perfected himself in
his master's calling; but whether by intuition or precept is not precisely known, although it could
not have been by either example or practice, since there has been no house built in the town during
the last century. He grew up to the respectable age of thirty without any thing remarkable
having occurred to him, which in the life of a hero is sufficiently remarkable in itself, to render
him a remarkable person. It is not, however, for this reason that we have introduced him to the
reader. It so happened that the dwelling-house of TEUNIS'S 'boss' was in the immediate neighborhood
of the Black Horse Tavern, a venerable house of entertainment, which bore the same
appellation many years before the revolutionary war, and during that glorious period had afforded
shelter and refreshment to many a valorous lover of freedom, whose deeds and names are now
covered with the dust of oblivion. This venerable house had a southern front, which looked
directly upon the hills of Neversink; and it was shaded by a comfortable-looking verandah which
was always kept as white as snow, and in the heats of summer had a peculiarly inviting aspect to
those who were fond of reclining in the shade and sipping cooling drinks. It will not appear
very surprising then that it was a favorite resort of TEUNIS, and that he there acquired a fondness
for drink which, so far from its being diminished by the return of winter, seemed rather to be
increased; and when the snow-white verandah of the 'Black Horse' no longer tempted him to
lounge upon its benches, for the very reason of its literal snow-whiteness, a close box-stove in
the bar-room within was quite as potent in drawing him to its genial warmth, where he found hot
drinks quite as soothing to his palate as a horn of whisky with a lump of ice in it had been
in the summer season. In process of time TEUNIS became a 'regular soaker,' and his person
manifested all the outward peculiarities which are common to that condition. He was the by-word

<!-- vol 21 page 377 -->

and reproach of the whole county, and nothing but his good-nature saved him from being 'turned
out of society;' for men, and women too, will forgive almost any vice if it is redeemed, or
accompanied by amiability, as they will not tolerate ill-nature if it be accompanied with the most
exalted virtues. But the love of liquor had not obliterated all the loveable qualities of TEUNIS.
No! abandoned, hardened, deadened, and lost as he appeared to the voice of friendship and
reproof, he yet retained enough of the dignity of his nature to love his own species, and he manifested
this by falling in love, in the most desperate and determined manner, with one of his neighbors'
daughters, Miss ANGELINE DUSENBURY. Upon being made acquainted with his passion,
the young lady, and the young lady's father and mother, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts,
cousins and second-cousins, all protested against it, and declared that it must not be thought of;
that ANGELINE could do better and ought to do better, and that TEUNIS was a most outrageous
and presuming person to dare to fall in love with her in that manner. So the young lady refused
him, and her friends refused him, and even the doctor and the dominie both shook their heads, and
said it would never answer; and TEUNIS professed to have found a very good reason for drowning
his sorrows in the bottle, which he strove to do incessantly.</p>

<p>Now it happened that about this time, the great temperance movement, which had been destroying
distilleries and reforming drunkards for more than ten years, extended its influence even
unto New-Diep, and made the very demijohns in the venerable 'Black Horse' look blue. Among
the very first converts who signed the tee-total pledge was the father of ANGELINE DUSENBURY,
who, in the paroxysms of his awakened philanthropy, sought out TEUNIS VAN DEUZER, and tried
to rouse him to a sense of his degradation, and convince him of the loveliness of temperance and
the charms of cold water. But TEUNIS was deaf to persuasion, and dead to argument; until at
last the new apostle of temperance worked his zeal in the great cause up to such an exalted pitch,
that he promised if TEUNIS would sign the tee-total pledge, and keep sober for twelve months, he
should at the expiration of that time be endowed with the hand of ANGELINE, with all her personal
charms and worldly goods. Although TEUNIS was at the time, in figurative language, 'half
shot,' he was instantly seized with a desire to join the cold-water army; and without giving his
Corypheus time to repent of his proposition, he put his name to the pledge, and from that moment
began to 'brush up.' We must leave the imagination of our readers to conceive the astonishment
of the ancient and orderly inhabitants of New-Diep, when they perceived the change which had
come over TEUNIS, and hasten on to more important particulars.</p>

<p>Just six months after this event, a grand temperance meeting was held in the County Hall;
and to give brilliancy to the occasion, and insure a full attendance, TEUNIS had been prevailed
upon to stand up in the meeting and relate his experiences. Fortified by thoughts of ANGELINE,
as an ancient knight in his struggles with a dragon overcame the power of his scaly enemy by
repeating the name of his mistress, TEUNIS overcame his dread of public opinion, and delivered
himself of his experiences, to the infinite delight of a numerous auditory, and the hopeful conversion
of two youthful citizens, who could boast, if they were boastfully given, of being the descendants
of an African prince. But what were trophies like these to the longing heart of TEUNIS?
He looked around that vast hall, and scanned the faces of the listening crowd, dimly illuminated as
they were by a dearth of tallow-candles which threw out more grease than light; but he nowhere
perceived the ruddy face of her for whose sake he displayed himself; and he hastened from
the hall and ran with rapid steps to the house of her father. There he beheld an unusual glare of
lights in the spare-room. What could it mean? Was she sick? No; people do not illuminate
their spare-rooms for sickness. All anxious to learn, he listened beneath the window. Amazement!
He heard the voice of the dominie speaking in solemn tones; and, too impatient to listen,
he burst open the door, and beheld a sight which he will probably never forget.</p>

<p>In the middle of the spare-room stood ANGELINE, dressed all in white muslin, and looking
lovelier than ever she looked before, in the very act of promising to love, honor, and obey a
brown-faced, black-haired young man of six feet and some odd inches, whom TEUNIS immediately
recognized as her second cousin, PETER VAN DEUZER, who owned a farm in the west-quarter.
The whole affair was too palpable to require an explanation; so none was either asked or made;
and TEUNIS rushed into the street, partly resolved to break his neck, and partly resolved to break
his pledge. Like a sensible man, he did neither; but like a very insensible man, he went to law,
and sued the father of ANGELINE for a breach of promise. How the suit will terminate, can be a
matter of small moment to the public, since every-body knows that in contested cases both sides
suffer, let the jury decide as they may. But to the friends of temperance it may be a consoling
fact to know, that TEUNIS continues true to his pledge, although there have not been wanting
croakers who have predicted that he will break it.</p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL COPY-RIGHT.</h3>

</div>

<p>CRISPIN, who stole leather to make shoes for the poor, was none
the less a thief, says Wolfgang Menzel, in an article on literary
piracy. But Menzel is a German, and it would be alike absurd and
unsafe for an eminently practical people, like ourselves, to be governed
in regard to our national policy by an eminently philosophical
people like the Germans. We are by no means certain that Crispin
is not a fellow to be copied: before we pronounce judgment upon
him, we must know whether he stole from his own countrymen, or
from foreigners. There is a vast difference; a difference as great
as the countries may be apart. Nothing can be more evident than
the proposition that a nation cannot exist by domestic thievery, for I
cannot steal from my neighbor unless my neighbor steal from abroad.
Therefore, in considering a theft, nationally, it is of the first importance
to know who it is that has been robbed. Like many other
acute critics, Menzel has furnished a very potent argument to refute
his own doctrines, by reasoning a little too close: the parallel between
the shoe-maker who steals his leather for the benefit of the
people, and the printer or book-publisher who pirates the contents
of a book, is a peculiarly unhappy one for the cause he advocates.
Nothing can be more evident, no principle is more strongly interwoven
in our policy as a nation, than that of encouraging domestic
manufactures. It is very plain that if the material for our books cost
us nothing, we can manufacture them more cheaply than a rival
nation that is compelled to pay their authors for producing them; it
is also equally evident that they can therefore be afforded at a
cheaper rate to the people, and that the quantity sold will be in proportion
to the lowness of the price, and that the intelligence of the
people will be in proportion to the number of books that are read:
if, in addition to the contents of our books, we could pirate the leather,
paper, types, and ink of which they are composed, we should be the
most enlightened and independent people in the world, if we are
not so already.</p>

<!-- vol 22 page 361 -->

<p>The trade of authorship has always entailed on its professors
poverty and disease. The sedentary habits which it induces must of
necessity undermine health: the abstraction from the every-day
affairs of life, requisite to its successful prosecution, almost always
causes insanity, or at least mania; and it is not clear that monomania
is not an essential feature of authorship: in fact, the history of
authorship is but a record of wretchedness. No other profession
has furnished an exclusive chapter of calamities. We never hear
of the calamities of merchants, of brick-layers, or cultivators. If
then we can save our countrymen from the exercise of a calling so
manifestly injurious to their happiness and welfare, by availing ourselves
of the labors of foreigners, to whom we owe neither protection
nor fealty, what man who wishes well to his country will have the
temerity to oppose a practice so conducive to our national prosperity?
We have declared ourselves a free and independent people; but
could it be said that we were either free or independent, if we were
restrained, by self-imposed laws, from making free with the labors
of a rival nation, separated from us by an ocean of three thousand
miles? or independent, if we were dependent upon ourselves for
our intellectual pabulum?</p>

<p>The only independent nation of modern times was the Algerines,
now unhappily extinct. They were a model people! They were
free and independent, in the most liberal and extended sense. They
were dependent upon themselves for nothing which they could take
from other nations, and so fully did they carry out their principle of
national independence, that they looked to a foreign power to furnish
them with their governors. No native of the soil was ever harassed
by the cares of government. All their rulers were imported
from abroad.</p>

<p>In respect of mere corporeal rulers, we are as yet far behind the
Algerines, but virtually we are in advance of them as respects our
governing power. No one will deny that to rule the mind is far
better, more honorable, more arduous, and more important, than to
rule the body. Our mental rulers are all foreigners; the majority of
them pensioners of a government that advocates and inculcates
principles directly opposed to those that we profess. They rule us
by means of the books that we cunningly pirate from them, and
thereby save ourselves a very great amount of trouble and expense.
It is true that some of our people are mad enough to attempt to
divide this ruling power with these foreigners, by publishing books
themselves; but their efforts only prove the correctness of our assertion;
for in order to smuggle their works into notice, they are compelled
to make them so nearly like those that are printed, that they
could not be distinguished from them, were it not for their title-pages.
Evidences of these truths abound, on all sides, as well in the Church
as the State. Some of our young preachers have improved their
opportunities of studying foreign books to that degree, that they have
boldly confessed that the great reformation was not only unjustifiable,
but a real detriment to the cause of humanity. Others have professed
a faith in the fine old conservative doctrine of the divine right

<!-- vol 22 page 362 -->

of kings; and one young presbyter that we know, has quitted his
country, and now officiates as a chaplain in the dominions of her
most gracious majesty, Victoria the First. Other blessings equal to
these are continually manifested by our rulers and legislators, who
give abundant evidence that they have profited by the continual
influx of foreign mind. One great statesman, of the Virginia school
of politics, a great patriot and a great orator also, profited to such an
extent by his foreign books, that he could not even read a work that
had been re-printed in this country. But we would not be thought
to advocate so sublime and patriotic an extension of the great principle
of pirating as this, because it would deprive our artisans and
tradesmen of a very profitable business. Perhaps the most remarkable
and beneficial effect of our independence of ourselves, is manifested
by the clergy, who depend almost entirely upon England for
their theology, and thereby become so thoroughly imbued with an
independent spirit, that when they happen to be troubled with a
thoracic disorder, or any other disease, immediately leave their flocks
to the care of the great Head of the Church, and hurry off to Europe
to consult foreign physicians, and inhale a mouthful of foreign air.</p>

<p>But the real benefits of the present system of pirating English
books, consist in the employment given to capital and labor. Our
paper-mills, type-founders, printers, binders, and book-sellers, are
kept in constant employment by the intellect of Great Britain. The
brain of Walter Scott alone gave employment to a greater number
of mechanics and tradesmen than that of any American since the
revolution, with the exception of Fulton. It must be borne in mind
that the imagination of a foreign author creates for us a source of
employment, which but for him would not exist; beside furnishing
for us a never-failing source of recreation and profitable enjoyment.
Were it not for Scott and Bulwer, Boz and James, we should have no
novels to read; were it not for Tom Moore, we should have no songs
to sing; and but for foreign composers, we should have no music.
Since the successful experiment of ocean navigation, we have
become more and more independent of ourselves; and we now have
the gratification of seeing London newspapers hawked about our
streets, to the very manifest falling off in the manufacture of the
home article. If we still remain true to ourselves, and resolutely
shut our ears to the complaints of these interested and mercenary
writers, both at home and abroad, the time will soon come when our
people will be saved entirely from all literary drudgery, and even
our newspapers be re-publications of London Times' and Chronicles,
as some of our Magazines already are of London and Edinburgh
and Dublin monthlies.</p>

<p>How absurd, how impudent, how mercenary and grovelling, it is
in these British authors to require of us to pass a law that will
deprive ourselves of such great advantages, merely to put a few
dollars in their pockets, and encourage a set of men among us to
supplant them, and so inculcate a spirit of base and servile self-dependence
among our people! The great object of an author
should be fame. No true genius will exert himself for filthy lucre.

<!-- vol 22 page 363 -->

It must be infinitely more grateful to a high nature to be read by
thousands, than to be paid by hundreds; and therefore we benefit
these foreigners in spite of themselves, by re-printing their works at
a cheap rate, thereby greatly enlarging the circle of their readers,
and adding to their reputation. It is very true that the British Parliament
has passed a law giving to American authors the privilege
of copyright as soon as a reciprocal law shall be passed by us; but
are we to be dictated to by the British Parliament? Are we to be
reminded of our duty by foreigners, who thus make a show of their
magnanimity, only to entice us to follow their example? Shall we
become mere copyists of another nation? Forbid it Justice! forbid
it Independence!</p>

<p>If we concede to the foreign author a right of property in the productions
of his brain, which after all is merely the distillation of other
people's ideas expressed in some other way before him, or at best
the promptings of Nature, which are the common property of mankind,
like air and sun-shine, we shall next be called upon to
recognize the inherent and indestructible right of an author to his
works, for all time.</p>

<p>When a citizen purchases of government a quarter section of land
in one of the territories, and pays for it at the rate of a dollar and a
quarter the acre, it becomes his own property, and the whole nation
would rise up like one man to defend him in the undisturbed possession
of it to the end of time. But if this same citizen should
devote the flower of his manhood, the vigor of his intellect, and even
the land itself which he may have purchased of his country, in the
production of a book for the benefit of humanity, he would have no
right to the possession of his work but for a very limited number of
years; and although he would be protected in the possession of his
land, or the products of it, from foreign aggression, we would not
allow him any protection in the enjoyment of the product of his brain,
even though a foreign nation should civilly agree to respect our law
for that purpose if we should think proper to pass one.</p>

<p>The reasons for these distinctions in regard to different kinds of
property are so very clear and conclusive, so exceedingly simple and
obvious, that we do not choose to insult the understanding of our
readers by repeating them. Some of the advocates of an international
copy-right have urged in its favor that a measure so just could
not be otherwise than politic, and that it would be safe to adopt one,
without any regard to expediency, but relying solely upon truth and
justness. But such a principle as this is directly at variance with
the genius of our constitution and laws; and were it adopted in one
case would be urged as a precedent in another, and an entire overthrow
of our system of government would be the consequence.
Were so mischievous a principle as this once adopted by our legislators
as their rule of action, what would become of those noble
specimens of eloquence with which we are favored every session of
Congress, when members who are perfectly agreed as to the justness
of a measure, dispute for weeks and months in regard to its expediency
or profit? What would become of our army and navy, and

<h3>A VERITABLE SEA STORY.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY HARRY FRANCO.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>'The sea, the sea, the o&mdash;pen sea, the blue, the <i>fresh;</i>' but here we halt;<br/>

Mr. CORNWALL knew very little about the sea, or he would have written SALT.<br/>

'The whales they whistled, the porpoise rolled,<br/>

And the dolphins bared their backs of gold;'<br/>

Worse and worse; more blunders than words, and such a jumble!<br/>

Whales <i>spout</i>, but never whistle; dolphins' backs are silver; and porpoises never roll, but tumble.<br/>

'It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,<br/>

And like a cradled creature lies,' and squalls,<br/>

He should have added; but to avoid brawls<br/>

With the poet's friends I'll quote no more; but <i>entre nous</i>,<br/>

Those who write correctly about the sea are exceeding few.<br/>

Young DANA with us, and MARRYAT over the water,*<br/>

Are all the writers that I know of, who appear to have brought a<br/>

Discerning eye to bear on that peculiar state of existence,<br/>

An ocean life, which looks so romantic at a distance.<br/>

To succeed where every body else fails, would be an uncommon glory,<br/>

While to fail would be no disgrace; so I am resolved to try my hand upon a sea-story.<br/>

In naming sea-authors, I omitted COOPER, CHAMIER, SUE, and many others,<br/>

Because they appear to have gone to sea without asking leave of their mothers:<br/>

For those good ladies never could have consented that their boys should dwell on<br/>

An element that Nature never fitted them to excel on.<br/>

Their descriptions are so fine, and their tars so exceedingly flowery,<br/>

They appear to have gathered their ideas from some naval spectacle at the 'Bowery;'<br/>

And in fact I have serious doubts whether either of them ever saw blue water,<br/>

Or ever had the felicity of saluting the 'gunner's daughter.'</p>

<p class="small">[*I HAVE unintentionally omitted to name FALCONER, who deserves the highest honors among
nautical writers.]</p>

<p>It was on board of the packet &mdash;&mdash;, from feelings deferential<br/>

To private griefs, I omit all facts that are non-essential:<br/>

To Havre we were bound, and passengers there were four of us,<br/>

Three men and a lady&mdash;not an individual more of us.<br/>

The month was July, the weather warm and hazy,<br/>

The sea smooth as glass, the winds asleep or lazy.<br/>

Dull times of course, for the sea, though favorable to the mind's expansion,<br/>

Yet keeps the body confined to a very few feet of stanchion.<br/>

Our employments were nought save eating, drinking and sleeping,<br/>

Excepting the lady, who a diary was keeping.<br/>

She was a very pleasant person though fat, and a long way past forty,<br/>

Which will of course prevent any body from thinking any thing naughty.<br/>

<!-- vol 23 page 152 -->

A very pleasant person, but such an enormous feeder,<br/>

That our captain began to fear she might prove a famine-breeder;<br/>

A sort of female Falstaff, fond of jokes and gay society,<br/>

Cards, claret, eau-de-vie, and a great hater of sobriety.<br/>

Her favorite game at cards she acknowledged was <i>ecart&eacute;</i>,<br/>

But like Mrs. Baule, she loved whist, and we soon made up a party.<br/>

We played from morn till night, and then from night till morning,<br/>

Although the captain, who was pious, continually gave us warning<br/>

That time so badly spent would lead to some disaster;<br/>

At which Madame G&mdash;&mdash; would laugh, and only deal the faster.<br/>

Breakfast was served at eight, and as soon as it was ended<br/>

Round flew the cards; and the game was not suspended<br/>

Until seven-bells struck, when we stopped a while for lunch,<br/>

To allow Madame time to imbibe her allowance of punch;<br/>

This done, at work we went, with heated blood and flushed faces,<br/>

Talking of kings, queens, knaves, tricks, clubs and aces.<br/>

At six bells (three P. M.,) we threw down our cards and went to dinner,<br/>

Where Madame never missed her appetite, whether she had been a loser or a winner;<br/>

Then up from the almonds and raisins, and down again to the queens and aces,<br/>

We had only to remove from one end of the table to the other to resume our places;<br/>

Another pause at six, P. M., for in spite of all our speeches,<br/>

Madame's partner would lay down his cards for the sake of pouchong and brandy peaches;<br/>

Being French and polite, of course, she only said '<i>Eh bien!</i>' but no doubt thought him a lubber,<br/>

For a cup of washy tea to break in upon her rubber.<br/>

At four bells (ten P. M.,) up from the cards and down again at the table,<br/>

To drink champagne and eat cold chicken as long as we were able:<br/>

With very slight variations this was the daily life we led,<br/>

Breakfast, whist; lunch, whist; dinner, whist; supper, whist; and then to bed.<br/>

The sea, for aught we know, was like that which Coleridge's mariners sailed on;<br/>

We never looked at it, nor the sky, nor the stars; and our captain railed on,<br/>

But still we played, until one day there was a sudden dismemberment of our party:<br/>

We had dined on soup <i>&agrave; la tortu</i>, (made of pig's feet,) of which Madame ate uncommonly hearty;<br/>

And had just resumed our game; it was her cut, but she made no motion;<br/>

'Cut, Madame,' said I; 'Good Heavens!' exclaimed her partner, 'I've a notion<br/>

That she <i>has</i> cut for good; quick! help her! she's falling!'<br/>

And the next moment on the floor of the cabin she lay sprawling.<br/>

Poor Madame! It was in vain that we tried hartshorne, bathing and bleeding;<br/>

Her spirit took its flight, tired to death of her high feeding:<br/>

For spirits are best content with steady habits and spare diet,<br/>

And will remain much longer in a tabernacle where they can enjoy repose and quiet<br/>

Than in a body that is continually uneasy with stuffing,<br/>

And goes about like an overloaded porter, sweating and puffing.</p>

<p>The next morning at four-bells, the sun was just uprisen,<br/>

Glowing with very joy to leave his watery prison;<br/>

The bright cerulean waves with golden scales were crested,<br/>

Forming the fairest scene on which my eyes had ever rested;<br/>

The wind was s. s. w., and when they let go the main-top bowline<br/>

To square the after yards, our good ship stopped her rolling.<br/>

Madame lay on the quarter-deck sewed up in part of an old spanker,<br/>

And for this glorious sight of the ocean we had solely to thank her,<br/>

For to have kept her lying in the cabin would have caused some of us to feel qualmish,<br/>

And she could not have been kept on deck, as the weather was growing warmish;<br/>

Therefore it had been resolved in a kind of council, on the captain's motion,<br/>

At sunrise to commit the old lady to the ocean.<br/>

She was placed upon a plank, resting upon the taffrail, (the stern railing,)<br/>

One end of which was secured by a bight of the trysail brailing.<br/>

The captain read the prayers, somewhat curtailed, but a just proportion,<br/>

The plank was raised, 'Amen!' the corpse dropped into the ocean.<br/>

Down in its deep mysterious caves she sunk to sleep with fishes,<br/>

While a few bubbles rose from her and burst as if in mockery of human wishes.<br/>

'Up with your helm; brace round; haul out your bowlines;<br/>

Clear up the deck; keep her full; coil down your tow-lines!<br/>

The ship was on her course, and not a word said to remind us<br/>

Of the melancholy fact that we had left one of our number behind us.<br/>

'Shocking affair!' I remarked to Madame's partner, who looked solemn as a mummy,<br/>

'O! horrid!' said he; '<i>I shall now be compelled to play with a Dummy!</i>'</p>

<h3>PETER FUNK'S REVENGE.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">BY HARRY FRANCO.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>WALKING down Broadway a few mornings since, I discovered a man
stationed opposite a store which had a small red flag hanging
at the door, with a large muslin banner, impended from a tall staff,
which he held, on which was inscribed this strange device: 'BEWARE
OF MOCK AUCTIONS!' Upon inquiry, I learned that this was intended
as a caution to Peter Funk, and a warning to strangers not to part
with their money without getting its full value in return. Upon farther
inquiry, I learned that this ingenious and benevolent enterprise
had been suggested by His Honor the Mayor, who in many other
ways has entitled himself to the gratitude of our citizens.</p>

<p>I had often heard of Peter Funk, but had never seen the gentleman,
and having a curiosity that way, determined to make the
acquaintance of so noted a person. I accordingly entered the store,
and saw a person dressed in very good style, with a satin scarf and
gold chain, standing behind a counter, with a small hammer in his
hand. He was a young man, with an air of the most entire self-satisfaction,
and nothing seemed to give him any uneasiness excepting
the 'Beware!' on the side-walk, which not only kept bidders from
entering the store, but caused a crowd of gaping idlers and ragged
news-boys to collect around his door. He had watches, chains and
other trinkets, which he seemed anxious to sell to the highest bidder,
but nobody would bid.</p>

<p>In one of the pauses of his continuous and commingled exhortations
to the crowd 'to walk in and secure a great bargain,' I asked him if
he was a regularly-licensed auctioneer, and was told that he was, and
that furthermore, he had always conducted his business in the most
honorable manner, and could produce first-rate recommendations
from his last employer. This might be true or it might not, but Mr.
Funk impressed me with the idea that he was an ill-used gentleman.
If Mr. Funk enjoyed any immunities to commit crime, like Mr. Nobody,
and other personages who are often spoken of but never seen,
it would be very just in our civic Aristides to warn the public against
his malpractices. But Mr. Funk assured me that he was amenable
to the laws, like any other merchant, and that he would n't grumble
at paying the penalty of any crime of which he might be convicted;
and he thought it a little peculiar, to say the least of it, that he
should be selected out from among the fraternity of tradesmen, to
be victimized. 'However,' said Mr. Funk, thrusting his hammer
into his coat-pocket, 'walk into my back office, Mister, and if I
don't make your hair stand on eend I'm a demijohn, and <i>no</i> mistake!'</p>

<p>This was making rather free with a stranger; but there was some

<!-- vol 27 page 59 -->

thing in the gentleman's manner which interested me, and I followed
him, through a small door in the partition, into his den, which was
ornamented by an engraving of a lady in a satin gown, that, viewed
at a certain distance, looked like a white horse rearing on his hind
legs. There were two or three choice works of art beside, including
a French snuff-box with a highly objectionable picture in the
inside of the cover, indicative of Mr. Funk's taste in such matters.
Having lighted a cigar and offered me one, which he assured me
was a 'splendid regalia, and <i>no</i> mistake,' he seated himself in his
arm-chair and unfolded the following stupendous plan for revenging
his own wrongs, and at the same time doing a good turn to his
fellow citizens.</p>

<p>'My legal adviser,' said Mr. Funk, 'tells me I can recover immense
damages from the mayor, for injury to my business, by his
bewaring strangers from my store; but,' continued Mr. Funk, as he
knocked the ashes from the end of his cigar with his jewelled little
finger, in a manner which Prince Albert might be proud of, 'I have
thought of a plan which knocks that into all sorts of cocked hats.
But wait a bit; there's a countryman.'</p>

<p>The countryman only put one foot into the store and immediately
withdrew it; so Mr. Funk at once resumed his seat and his cigar,
and went on:</p>

<p>'Here's my progammy,' said Mr. Funk; 'I am getting up some
'Bewares' myself, and a most immense sensation I'll produce with
them, I assure you. First, I will have a large banner carried by a
Kentucky giant opposite the City Hall, with this inscription in bloody
red letters: 'BEWARE OF LAWYERS!'</p>

<p>'Opposite Trinity church, at the head of Wall-street, I will station
another, to be carried by a lame individual, with this inscription in
gilt letters: 'BEWARE OF FANCY STOCKS!' At the corner of Park-Place
and Broadway I'll have a flashy gentleman carrying a black-and-white
banner with this motto: 'BEWARE OF BLACKLEGS!'
Then I'll have a flying regiment of boys with pink silk flags bearing this
inscription: 'LADIES, BEWARE OF FRENCH MILLINERY AND FANCY
GOODS!' and these shall run up and down Broadway every day between
twelve and two, and whenever they see a carriage full of
ladies, they shall keep flapping the flags in their faces.</p>

<p>'Another banner shall be stationed opposite the hotels and coffee-houses,
with this inscription in blue capitals: 'BEWARE OF COCKTAILS
AND BRANDY SMASHERS!'</p>

<p>'Opposite the publishers' shops I will have a young woman in a
night-cap, holding a banner with these words in gamboge: 'TO
READERS: BEWARE OF TRASH!' '</p>

<p>I confessed to Mr. Funk that I was struck with the novelty of his
plan, and hoped he would not lay himself open to a prosecution for
libel; and I cautioned him to be very careful not to insinuate anything
against our 'free institutions.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you mean the House of Detention?' said Mr. Funk, inquiringly.
I then explained to him what I did mean, and to my
great surprise found that his mind had been so much affected by the

<!-- vol 27 page 60 -->

well-meant expedient of the civic authorities for driving customers
away from his store, that he could not comprehend my meaning at
all; and instead of expressing any reverence for our institutions, he
pronounced an opinion which I should be very sorry to repeat, even
at second hand. Mr. Funk then told me that he had given an order
for no less than five hundred standards, to be emblazoned with these
remarkable words, 'BEWARE OF HUMBUGS!' But my respect for authority
and learning will not admit of my naming the places where
these banners were to be displayed. The invention of Mr. Funk
could only be equalled by his malignity. What could have been
conceived more maliciously inappropriate, than to station a pumpkin-headed
effigy, in a black coat, bearing one of these standards
painted in harlequin letters, before the residence of Professor &mdash;&mdash;?
Or to put a man of straw, with a similar standard painted in green
capitals, before the office of Dr. &mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>'It was at least prudent in you, Mr. Funk,' I said, 'not to station
any of your 'bewares' before the doors of our city presses: the gentlemen
who conduct them, you are aware, cannot be abused with
impunity.'</p>

<p>'Poh! poh!' replied this unprincipled person; 'see here.' And
so saying, he unrolled a paper which lay before him, upon which was
emblazoned in miniature a dozen or two of banners, to be paraded
before the doors of some of our most highly-esteemed friends. My
blood curdled at the sight, or at least it would have done so, if any
thing could have caused such a phenomenon. Here was a banner
for the 'Virtuous Vigil,' inscribed with these words: 'BEWARE OF
VENALITY!' The 'Morning Glory' was honored with this wholly
unmeaning <i>affiche</i>, 'BEWARE OF BLUSTERERS!' while the 'Evening
Vesper' was destined to be signalized with this detestable insinuation:
'BEWARE OF SOFT CRABS!' than which nothing could be more
vile, its conductors being universally known as two of the <i>hardest</i>
customers about town. The 'Weekly Wonder' had this entirely unmeaning
standard assigned to it, which was to be borne by a gentleman
in a clean shirt, with an inflated bladder in one pocket and an empty bottle
the other, the letters in deep blue: 'BEWARE OF
FALSE WITNESSES!'</p>

<p>This was too bad. I could listen to Mr. Funk no longer, without
losing my self-respect. I therefore rose and spoke to him as mildly
as my feelings would allow, as follows:</p>

<p>'I perceive, Sir, that you richly merit the character which you bear
in this community. I did believe that you were an injured individual,
but the mayor knew you better than I did, when he sent a cohort of
paupers into Broadway, with banners to 'beware' simple-minded people
from your door. It will be a lesson to me in future to mistrust
my own judgment when it comes in conflict with the decisions of
those having authority. Let me say to you, beware! Beware how
you cast suspicion against respectable citizens who are engaged in
advancing their own interests; seek some honest employment, and
when the authorities endeavor to undermine your business and drive
customers from your shop, remember that they do it for the public

<!-- vol 27 page 61 -->

good, and do not seek revenge by depriving honest men of their
means of growing rich.'</p>

<p>Contrary to my expectation, this speech, instead of an apology
only drew a laugh from Mr. Funk, who lighted another cigar, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Go it while you're young!'</p>

<p>'I have no disposition to be too harsh toward you,' I said, 'and
therefore I will commend you for not uttering a 'beware' derogatory
to the clergy, who are generally made a butt of by men like yourself.'</p>

<p>'Wait a bit,' said Mr. Funk, leaping from his chair. 'I suppose
there can be no harm in quoting Scripture?'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' I said.</p>

<p>'Well, then, what do you think of this, for the Gothic churches?'
and he unrolled a large black banner, inscribed with white letters:</p>

<p class="center">'BEWARE OF WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING!'</p>

<hr/>

<h3>PLAYING ON ONE STRING.</h3>

</div>

<p>MUSICAL critics affect a contempt for artists who court popular
applause, in imitation of Paganini, by playing on one string. But
all great men have been one-string performers; and it was by this
method alone that the great <i>ma&euml;stro</i> gained his fame and fortune.
In no other manner can the world be prevailed upon to shell-out its
praises and pennies. The keen-eyed world is very justly suspicious
of the prodigy who beats a drum with his elbows while his
hands are engaged with a pair of cymbals, and his lips discoursing
with a pandean pipe. Too many cooks are not more certain to spoil
the broth than too many broths to spoil the cook. The admirable
Crichton has had the reputation of being a many-stringed performer,
but as he left no evidence of his greatness behind him, we
have always suspected him of being little better than an admirable
humbug. The world has yet to see the genius who excels in two
things. The division of labor began in the beginning: Tubal Cain
was a worker in brass, but his brother was a musician. They perceived
in those early days that life was short, though it was something
longer than at present, a few hundred years or so; and discovered
the necessity of every man confining himself to one business.
They saw that dates and figs never grew on the same tree,
and wisely inferred that the human plant was intended to bear but
one kind of fruit. One of the surest indications of a small genius

<!-- vol 27 page 337 -->

is an aptness for every thing. Jacks-of-all-trades are proverbially
good at none. People who are every thing in 'one revolving moon,'
remain nothings all their lives.</p>

<p>There is a division of genius as of labor. The <i>faits accompli</i> of
the moral world form a piece of mosaic, but the <i>faits</i> of which it is
composed are jewels by themselves, not worthless bits of color
which are only valuable when set. Unless a character will shine by
itself it is not worth setting in the great mosaic work of history.
There are no vari-colored jewels. The diamond, the ruby, the emerald,
each has a hue of its own. But stones of lesser value are
parti-colored. There are some seeming exceptions to this rule;
Michel Angelo, Da Vinci, Go&euml;the, Sheridan and Scott. But these
are only seeming exceptions; they were emphatically one-string
performers. Leonardo Da Vinci came the nearest to a many-string
player of any man in history. But in spite of his music and mathematics,
the world knows him only as the painter of the Last Supper
and of the Logos. Michel Angelo was nothing as an artist (do n't
be alarmed!) in the sense in which Titian and Phidias were artists.
He had tremendous thoughts, and he employed the plastic arts
to give them expression, as Dante would have done if he had not been
gifted with the greater faculty of language. A sentence of Dante or
Milton will produce as stupendous an image as Saint Peters. They
worked in words, but Michel worked in stone and plaster. The
two capacities of expression have never yet been greatly held by the
same individual. Moore said of Sheridan, 'He touched every string
of the lyre and was master of all,' or something to that effect. But
he was master of none, and only clever on one. It is not easy to
say from which he drew the loudest sound. The mocking-bird can
imitate the notes of all other fowls, but he has no music of his own;
his genius lies in mimicry, not in music. The great Newton said
there was no such thing as genius; labor did all. But he was careful
to attempt nothing for which his genius did not qualify him. He
discovered the centre of gravity with ease, but he might have labored
his life-time without discovering the centre of wit, which his
contemporary Swift did without labor. Those philosophers who
believe in Newton's saying, should attempt to play like De Meyer
or plead like Webster. Probably they will say they could if they
should try; as the clown said he did n't know whether he could play
on the violin as he had never tried.</p>

<p>There is no universality of genius; all men have an appointed
use, and the great cause of distress in the world arises from men not
being put to their proper employment. Social laws make mongrels
of men. If every one had his appointed place, life would be like a
'roundelay that's sweetly played in tune.' Two of a trade would
then always agree, and we should have one proverb less. Men exactly
adapted to their employments are now so rare that when one is
found he is reckoned a prodigy. It requires a <i>bouleversement</i> to produce
a batch of heroes, because when society is shaken up men
naturally fall into their right places. The three great revolutions
brought out Cromwell, WASHINGTON and Napoleon. But for the

<!-- vol 27 page 338 -->

shaking up in France, what a host of immortals would have remained
in the obscurity of coopers' shops and caf&eacute;s, and instead of having
statues erected in their honor, would have been buried without the
compliment of a head-stone! The chance of a man being born into
the situation which he is best qualified to fill is one to a million.
Genius sometimes breaks his shackles, but it is melancholy to think
of the mute Miltons of whom we have never heard. Poverty is
not the only bar to distinction; on the contrary, men of rank generally
rise from the ranks. The poor are without restraint; they may
rise if they can; but the rich have generally the dead weight of a
pre-determined occupation tied to their heels. It is often a misfortune
to be born in what are called fortunate circumstances. The
road to ruin generally lies through the demesnes of a rich father.
If there have been Giffords confined in a stall, there have also been
cobblers cribbed in colleges. Many an inglorious wearer of a
crown might have been respected as the wearer of an apron.
Louis XVI. would have made an excellent pastry cook, and George
the Fourth, instead of being despised as a king, might have won
universal respect as a barber. President&mdash;but 't is too soon to talk
of presidents. We are surprised at seeing a man do a variety of
things, but we are not instructed. Versatility is but a synonyme for
mediocrity. One art is enough for one life. By doing one thing
with constancy and affection we inevitably do it well, provided it
be the one thing which we most desire to do. Men are slaves who
labor in an ungenial sphere, though they eat their own wages, but
Plautus was a freeman when he wrote comedies, though his master
took his hire. Authors are sometimes admonished, particularly in
this country, where men are pretty certain to starve by authorship, to
secure some certain means of subsistence before venturing in their
'dreadful trade.' But why authors should be advised in this way
more than other men is not easily discovered. Those who embark in
literature with such precautions, will be very certain of needing
some other reward than their authorship will bring them. A physician
who should think of securing an income by preaching, that he
might the more safely practice in his profession, would be about as
likely to meet with success as an author who should commence business
as a jobber to enable him to compose a history or a poem.
Let the jobber stick to his merchandise and the author to his books;
they will both do better for being kept apart. The majority of mankind
have healthy bodies and sound minds, and are supposed to be
capable of any thing. They stay where they are put, and only aim
to make themselves comfortable; if they are behind a counter it is
well; if in the pulpit or at the bar, it is all the same. They die and
make no sign, and leave the world as they found it. They are not performers on
one string, nor indeed, performers at all. What do they
perform? They are the people, not individuals. Sometimes half a
dozen of them are swallowed up under one short name, as Brown and
Co.; three or four of the same family are often deemed of so little
consequence as individuals that they designate themselves simply
Jones Brothers, or Smith and Sons; or collateral branches of the same

<!-- vol 27 page 339 -->

family my be included under the firm of Cripps and Nephews.
Then we encounter a string of them who wish to preserve their individuality
and tie their names together after this fashion: Wilkins,
Tomkins and Watkins. But what Wilkins? what Tomkins and
Watkins? Nobody can tell. Again we meet with a near approach
to an individual. Two men find it convenient to make a union of
forces, but one of them wishes to preserve his identity, so he calls
himself P. Q. Davis and Winkle. In a little time and even P. Q.
Davis will be lost in the mass, and there will be nothing left of him
but his virtues which will be heard of for the first time by the stone cutter.</p>

<p>Shakspeare was a player on one string; ah! and what a performer!
Dryden, like Sheridan, touched every string of the lyre,
and was hardly master of one. He wrote forty odd plays, not one
of which is either acted or played at this day. The late Stuart
Newton used to tell an amusing story about one of his pupils whose
father had an ambition that he should become an artist. The boy
had worked dismally enough for a week with his chalk, when the
painter found him in tears; on being asked the cause of his grief,
the victim of misdirected ambition replied, 'I do n't want to be a
hartist; I wants to be a butcher!' Fortunately for this young
hopeful he had fallen into merciful hands; and now, instead of being
a miserable spoiler of canvass, he may be a happy retailer
of joints in Clare market. He may be an alderman; an honor which
no artist has ever attained to, though many butchers have; it being
an universal rule in municipal affairs, that the lowest employments
produce the best legislators and magistrates.</p>

<p>Men fritter away their lives with us in attempting to do every
thing, and therefore we have produced fewer great men in proportion
to our population than any other civilized people. The majority
of our prominent politicians come from the slave states; they
nearly monopolize the highest national offices, and that part of the
country has become a nursery for statesmen, because it is there
alone that they make a profession of politics. They have nothing
else to do, or nothing that they choose to do; and at the North we
become more familiar with the names of Southern representatives
from their continual repetition in the newspapers, than we ever do
with our own, who rarely go to Washington a second time. At
the North men are elected representatives by accident; at the
South it is different; there they play on one string and find their
account in it. Nobody can afford to twang on one chord, or blow
one note long, here. The lawyer is writing sermons, the divine is
preaching politics, the merchant is delivering lectures, the artist has
turned philosopher, the mechanic is talking about agriculture, the
jobber speculating in real estate, and the farmer dabbling in stocks
instead of improving his stock. Every body must become acquainted
with every other body's business. This all happens from
people engaging in business with their hands alone, as some people
marry and then try for a divorce, and not with their hearts.</p>

<p>Hazlitt wrote an essay on the ignorance of the learned, which

<!-- vol 27 page 340 -->

sounds paradoxical. But the learned always must be ignorant on
subjects which they do not perfectly understand. It is the smatterer
only who knows a little of every thing&mdash;is well instructed in nothing.
Nobody need be ashamed of his ignorance; in truth, ignorance
is highly creditable, provided always that one knows something
thoroughly. But it is the prevailing fashion in society for every
body to resemble a 'Conversations Lexicon,' one of those pestiferous
inventions for promoting shallowness among mankind, and be
always ready to go off like a revolving rifle.</p>

<p>Men who take their degrees at colleges are often reproached by
your many-string performers with knowing nothing but book-learning,
which is generally true enough; but then what they do know
they know well, and so they contrive to gather a good many of the
honors which the world bestows upon its favorites.</p>

<p>There seems to be a fear among us that something or other in
the great plan of our economy will be neglected; and men are continually
busying themselves about other people's affairs, to the manifest
disadvantage of their own. But it is very certain that among
our twenty millions there are people enough to attend to every department,
and the true way to discharge one's public duty is to see
that one thing is well done. The banker may confine himself to
his desk in perfect security that the butcher and baker will furnish
his food if they are only let alone; the artist may stick to his studio
and the cobbler to his last without any fears for the future; the
farmer and the tailor will see that there is no lack of food and raiment.
The greatest famine ever known in France was when the
National Convention undertook to supply the people with bread;
and they have just abandoned the corn laws in England because
they found that taking such especial care to supply the people with
food had brought them to a state of starvation. Take no heed of
what others are doing, but be sure to do something yourself; then
you may grow like the lilies of the valley, and be as well cared for.</p>

<p>I knew a merchant a few years since who was in continual tribulation
about public affairs, who used to spend a good many hours
in writing essays, which he would sign 'Humanitas,' or 'Philo'-something,
and send to a morning paper, which had the cruel courtesy
to print them. Public affairs continued as usual, but his private
affairs soon got into a dreadful condition, and he failed, and began
to talk about his misfortunes. But his great misfortune was attempting
to play on more than one string.</p>

<p>It is really refreshing to mix with very humble people who earn
their living by practising one art exclusively; what they know they
know so purely, and can communicate their knowledge so clearly.
Crispin, who sticks to his last, is an admirable critic compared with
some multifarious geniuses who stick at nothing. A statesman of
some note, who has filled an important diplomatic office, in his outset
in life kept a small school in a rural district in Pennsylvania,
where he fell in love with a daughter of the village barber, and proposed
to marry her. The girl's mother flared up at the proposal,
and flatly refused her consent. Her friends thinking that the school

<!-- vol 27 page 341 -->

master's occupation, which has never been held in very high esteem
in the Key-stone State, was the cause of her opposition, remonstrated
with her and said, 'Who knows but the schoolmaster will be a merchant
one of these days?' 'Oh, it is n't that,' replied the worthy
lady; 'I could get over his profession, but he is such a fool!' And
a fool he was to her, and by continuing to be a fool he got to be an
ambassador.</p>

<p>Macaulay says, that to become a great poet you must first become
a little child; which is contrary to the popular opinion, it being
thought requisite even for a very small poet to be a monster of
erudition. But the critic is right; only he might have said, that to
be great in any thing you must be a little child, single-minded and
pure-hearted; or in other words, a performer on one string. Poets
in the 'cotton trade and sugar line' are very doubtful hybrids; their
credit is as bad on 'change as on Parnassus.</p>

<p>There are many striking instances on record of success achieved
by one-string players of very feeble powers. We read not long
since, in the obital corner of a newspaper, the account of a person's
decease who was spoken of as 'an eminent and well-known theatrical
wig maker.' There are few persons who could have looked
for fame while making theatrical wigs. But here was a gentleman
who, by constancy and 'strict attention to business,' had become
'eminent and well-known.' Perhaps he had made investments in
stocks, and owned a crimson pew in some fashionable Gothic church.
Arkwright, again, not finding his tonsorial duties to his mind, very
properly left off making wigs and took to making machinery; and
by sticking to that business, gained a fortune and a title, and a place
among the immortals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable instance of success crowning the
efforts of a very humble pursuit was that of Boswell, who immortalized
himself as a toady. He confined his whole soul to one
string, and never forgot himself for the space of half a second. He
stuck to his one string with a devotedness worthy&mdash;we were going
to say of a better object&mdash;but it was well enough; by sticking to
it he made it an object to him. Macaulay, who said so sensible a
thing just now about poets, wrote an ill-natured review-article to
prove him a fool for his pains. But Boswell knew perfectly well
what he was doing, and he defended his foolishness with the eloquence
of a man 'terribly in earnest,' as they say. Mr. Macaulay
certainly forgot this passage in the Hebridean tour, when he wrote
his searching review of Mr. Croker:</p>

<p>'My fellow traveller and I, <i>(Johnson,)</i> talked of going to Sweden,'
says Boswell; 'and while we were settling our plan I expressed a
pleasure in the prospect of seeing the king. Johnson said: 'I doubt,
Sir, if he would speak to us.' <i>(Mark the modesty of Ursus Major,
who never thought of the king, because he was a king himself and not a
toady.)</i> Col. Macleod said: 'I am sure Mr. Boswell would speak
to him.' <i>(Of course he would; 't was his business.)</i> 'Here let me add,'
continues the immortal toady, 'a short defence of that propensity
<i>(toadying)</i> in my disposition to which this gentleman alluded. It

<!-- vol 27 page 342 -->

has procured me much happiness. I hope it does not deserve so
hard a name as forwardness or impudence. If I know myself, it is
nothing more than an eagerness to share the society of men distinguished
either by their rank or their talents, and a diligence to attain
what I desire. If a man is praised for seeking knowledge, though
mountains and seas are in his way, may he not be pardoned whose
ardor in the pursuit of the same object leads him to encounter difficulties
as great?' Of course he may be pardoned and praised too.
This passage lets a flood of light upon the mysterious meanness of
Boswell's character. He was a toady upon heroic principles. He
played on his one string with a prophetic eye to the renown of his
performance.</p>

<p>'Act well your part' is superfluous advice; you will be sure to
act your part well if it <i>is</i> your part. All the danger lies in attempting
to act a part which belongs to another.</p>

<p>A work entitled "Asmodeus, or Legends of New York," having
made its appearance a few weeks since, which caused no small excitement
in our quiet city, and the author of that work having promised
a sequel&mdash;which to this time has not appeared&mdash;therefore the present
publishers having been offered the MS. of this work, thought from the
character of the same, it would in one sense carry out the original
design of the author of "Asmodeus." It will not be necessary for
the publishers to make a comparison between the two, as it regards
literary points of view&mdash;all we have to say is that the "Iniquities of
New York" is written by an author of acknowledged talent. In
regard to the merits of the work as a true vehicle of the "Iniquities"
of our great city, the reader has only to read this work and he will
see that the author of "Asmodeus," or "Mysteries and Miseries of
New York" knew but little of what he professed to write a great deal
about.</p>

</div>

<p>This work is no creation of the fancy&mdash;though in the form of fiction,
its scenes, variations and plots are all drawn from real life, and are

<p>If the reader should deem any of the disclosures improper or indelicate,
let him remember that it is impossible to reveal the condition
of the unfortunate women of a great city like New York, without the
use of language and the exhibition of scenes that, employed for

that the boldest language in the book is drawn from the celebrated
report of the Magdalen Society, and that it is here given to aid
in the great purpose of this work&mdash;that is, the alleviation of the miseries,
the wants and the woes of the unfortunate. Who will not at
once, after reading this work, come out and assist us in putting down
the thousand ways whereby houses of ill-fame are kept supplied
with "fresh hands?" We say, who will not? It will doubtless be
those who own and rent the "dens of infamy," those who in their
every day life are considered good, moral, upright men, their pockets

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE MAGDALENS OF NEW YORK.</p>

</div>

<p>TO portray the condition of society in New York, requires a free
and fearless pen. The woes and wailings, the iniquities and infamy
of women, form the theme of this chapter, and to hold them up before
the eyes of the public, demands an exposition that, though it may
shock the sensitive, will nevertheless command the attention and approval
of the wise and good.</p>

<p>The wrongs and degradation of woman betrayed and lost&mdash;this is
the argument of our song! Woman, with all thy beauty and tenderness
and love&mdash;when fallen from the heaven in which thou wast
ordained to move&mdash;how like the spirits of evil dost thou become!
Lucifer, hurled from his seat at the right hand of Jehovah to the
bottomless deep of the damned, and with maddened hate wreaking out
his wrath against all that is good, is a type of woman fallen from the
heavenly throne of virtue to the deep abyss of that shameless and most
dreadful of all the traffics of sin.</p>

<p>The fifteen or twenty thousand of unfortunates of the City of New
York&mdash;women lost to virtue and forsaken by friends&mdash;who can depict
their lamentable condition in colors of truth, without opening a sealed
book of mystery, misery and wo?</p>

<p>We must not approach this subject with any feeling of mawkish
delicacy&mdash;truth, the most alarming and sorrowful must be told without
fear of uttering what a squeamish fastidiousness might deem
indelicate, or of making exposures that may shock the nerves of the
sensitive.</p>

<p>We shall not enter alone on this dangerous volcano, belching
forth its eruptions over the bright fields of innocence and youth and
beauty, and making desolate the homes and hearts of unnumbered
sufferers.</p>

<p>REPORT OF ARTHUR TAPPAN,</p>

<p>ON THE MAGDALENS OF NEW YORK.</p>

</div>

<p>This report was made eighteen years ago, and depicts a most
depraved and horrible state of society.</p>

<p>It estimates the number of women in this city, that make prostitution
their trade, at <i>Ten Thousand</i>. By the natural laws of the increase of
vice, which more than keeps pace with the augmentation of the population,
this amount, which was then deemed too small, must now be
swelled to the frightful number of TWENTY THOUSAND WOMEN in the
City of New York who drive that most dreadful of all trades&mdash;the
traffic of their virtue for gold!</p>

<p>The following statement is authentic. It was made by men distinguished
for their piety, and learning, and who made a thorough
investigation the basis of their report. It is the</p>

<p>"First Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the New
York Magdalen Society. Instituted January 1st, 1830."</p>

<p>Of this Society, the distinguished philanthropist, Arthur Tappan,
was President. Its members were composed of the pious and good,
both men and women. Its object was to save the rising generation
from ruin, and to rescue the victims of man's pleasure from their
degradation.</p>

<p>For this purpose they had established a "Probationary House,"
which was an</p>

<p>"Asylum for Females who have deviated from the path of virtue,
and who are desirous of being restored to good habits."</p>

<p>But let us turn to the report, which exhibits the condition and miseries
of this class of unfortunates with a freedom and boldness that we
should not venture to employ.</p>

<p>After giving a brief outline of the history of their institution, the
report proceeds to speak thus boldly of the main subject:</p>

<p>"The extent of prostitution in this city, as shown by facts already

<!-- page 9 -->

developed during our labors, and the alarming increase of the unhappy
victims of seduction among us, of which we have attained the most
demonstrative evidence, so far exceed all our own previous calculations,
that we are prepared to anticipate skepticism and incredulity in
others. Indeed, enough is in our possession to cause a thrill of horror
to be felt by every virtuous man and woman in the community, such
as was never produced by any expose of vice which has ever met the
public eye. Did not prudence and delicacy forbid the disgusting detail
of what has been brought to our knowledge thus early in the history
of this Society, every parent would tremble for the safety of his
sons as well as his daughters, and we could a tale disclose which
would cause the blood to 'chill within the veins, and each particular
hair to stand erect, like quills upon the fretted porcupine.' But we
shall forbear, and only set forth those general facts which plead for
the necessity of extensive and efficient efforts, in behalf of those unhappy
females, for whose reformation and salvation the New York
Magdalen Society is engaged.</p>

<p>"First, then, we would present the fact, that we have satisfactorily
ascertained that the number of females in this city, who abandon
themselves to prostitution, is not less than TEN THOUSAND!!
The data on which this estimate is founded are, first, the opinion of
the Alderman, whose experience and observation for several years
past, as Commissioner at Bellevue, enabled him to judge very accurately,
and from whom we learned in the commencement of our labors,
what we then thought improbable, that there were '<i>ten thousand harlots
in this city</i>.' But although we then judged that the number was
overrated, we are driven to the painful admission, that his estimate
was just, from our own observation in the partial census we have attempted.</p>

<p>"We have the names, street, and number of the houses of ill-fame
in this city, notoriously inhabited by abandoned women; and also the
houses of assignation, where daily and nightly the pollution of girls
and women of all ages and colors, married and single, is habitually
committed. Many of these sinks of iniquity are in respectable neighborhoods,
disguised under the mask of boarding houses, dressmakers,
milliners, stores and shops of various kinds. Some of them are large
and elegant houses, provided with costly furniture, and have brass
and silver plates on the doors, on which are engraved the real or
fictitious names of the occupants.</p>

<p>"These haunts of iniquity have been discovered partly by the aid
of the police officers, partly by the girls and women who have been

<!-- page 10 -->

rescued from pollution by the Asylum, and partly by the vigilance of
persons, male and female, employed by the Society. By these means
we have arrived at very many of the secrets of these nests of abomination,
the number of lewd women who reside or resort to each, the arts
and intrigues by which the victims of seduction are procured, as well
as the <i>names</i> of scores of the men and boys who are the seducers of
the innocent, or the companions of the polluted. Hence our opportunity
of judging of the extent of prostitution in the city, is now by no
means limited, and we are satisfied we do not exaggerate when we repeat,
that there are now <i>ten thousand</i> girls and women, in the City of
New-York, who live by public and promiscuous prostitution. Besides
these, we have the clearest evidence that there are hundreds of private
harlots and kept misses, many of whom keep up a show of industry
as domestics, nurses, &amp;c., in the most respectable families, and throng
the houses of assignation every night. Although we have no means
of ascertaining the number of these, yet enough has been learned from
the facts already developed to convince us that the aggregate of these
is alarmingly great, perhaps little behind the proportion of the City of
London, whose police reports assert, on the authority of accurate researches,
that the number of private prostitutes in that city is fully
equal to the number of public harlots. This is a most appalling
picture of moral degradation, and we forbear to dwell upon so painful
and mortifying conclusions as those to which this view of the subject
would impel us. We cannot forget, however, that the Rev. Mr. Stafford,
formerly employed as a missionary among the depraved population
of our city, published his conviction, after careful investigation of
this subject, that there were fifteen thousand abandoned females in
this city, and our population, permanent and transient, was then one-third
less than it is now.</p>

<p>"As, however, we would not add one shade to the dark picture of
our city's pollution, we shall assume it as a fact, that there are <i>ten
thousand</i> only of these lewd women in New York, and we do so because
we had rather underrate the aggregate than augment it.
Among these there are girls of fourteen, thirteen, and even twelve
years of age in incredible numbers, such as the House of Refuge has
rescued, although that spacious institution would not hold all such,
could they be sent there. Some of these, it is revolting to human nature
to relate, are devoted to prostitution thus early in life by their
own <i>mothers</i>, either in their own houses kept as brothels, or placed, by
these unnatural monsters in female form, in the houses kept by others.</p>

<p>"Besides these, many of them are the daughters of the wealthy,

<!-- page 11 -->

respectable and pious citizens of our own and other States, seduced
from their homes by the villains who infest the community, preying
upon female innocence, and succeeding in their diabolical purpose,
either by promises of marriage; or, after deceiving them into a brothel,
by the commission of rape; often first depriving the victims of their
lust, of their reason, by stupefying drugs kept in these dens of iniquity
for the purpose. Individual cases of each of these descriptions are
known to the Society, in which the unhappy girl has been kept
imprisoned for weeks, until all hope of escape from infamy was lost,
and she at last gave herself up to intemperance and crime.</p>

<p>"Among these are very many daughters of poor parents, and
especially widowed mothers, whose necessities compelled them to seek
employment as domestics. For such, especially the young and inexperienced,
the keepers of these brothels are eagerly seeking in the
character of procuresses, and soon after hiring them as servants, they
are sent into a room with some man, or rather monster in human shape,
and compelled to submit to his vile purpose, for which the procuress
is liberally paid. The poor girl now finds herself ruined, and is
presently seduced to consent to a life of infamy, by the promise of
plenty of money, fine clothes, &amp;c., and all is lost. Numbers of these
cases have already come under our observation, in which women were
thus the active agents in effecting the ruin of the young and unwary
of their own sex; and then the children die from neglect or cruelly,
or are perhaps sent to the Alms House, while the mothers give themselves
up to guilt and infamy.</p>

<p>"But we will not affect to conceal that hundreds, perhaps thousands
of them, are the daughters of the ignorant, depraved and vicious part
of our population, trained up without culture of any kind, amid the
contagion of evil example, and enter upon a life of prostitution for the
gratification of their unbridled passions, and become harlots altogether
by choice. These have a short career, generally dying of the effects
of intemperance and pollution soon after entering upon this road to
ruin.</p>

<p>"Without attempting to protract these loathsome details, or offering
comment which we deem unnecessary, we would here present the
result of our observation, in reference to the effects of this course of
life upon the wretched females themselves. Soon after they begin
their vicious indulgence; in a drunken frolic, at the dance house, or
in the street, they become involved in riotous conduct, are arrested
and sent to the watch house, whence they are committed to the Penitentiary
for sixty days. This penance is most generally unproductive,

<!-- page 12 -->

for on their discharge they are eagerly sought for by the former companions
of their guilt, and return to their crimes. Soon they are
overtaken by that disease, the judicial visitation of heaven for the sin
of uncleanness, and are presently found in the Alms House Hospital,
where for weeks together the deaths among them are said to average
one every day. Indeed, it is evident in this city, as elsewhere long
since shown, that among those who commence a life of prostitution
early, from three to five years is the average period of their existence,
for intemperance and pollution rapidly hurry them into the grave, a
signal proof of the declaration, that 'the wicked shall not outlive half
their days.'</p>

<p>"Now in the view of these melancholy truths, as painful to relate
as they are to hear, and presenting a portrait of moral death, amid the
blaze of Gospel light with which our city is favored; is there not
enough to awaken compassion and zeal in the heart of every individual
who fears God and loves his neighbor? <i>compassion</i> to snatch the
wretched victims of vice from the sorrows they are preparing for
themselves? and <i>zeal</i>, to step as it were, between the living and the
dead, to stay the plague which assails the very vitals of society?</p>

<p>"It is scarcely necessary to declare, so well known is the fact, that
in this vast city, multitudes of young creatures are continually deluded,
inveigled, enticed or surprised into the path of ruin by means of the
vilest artifices, of whom it may be truly said, in the language of Dr.
Johnson, that their wretched condition is 'as much their <i>misfortune</i> as
their <i>fault</i>.' It is a lamentable fact that men are the original cause
of the evil complained of; yet it is but too true that women take their
revenge a hundred fold. Seductions of females among us are often
attended with peculiar aggravations, and the abandoned of both sexes
reciprocally the tempters of the virtuous. But it is clearly ascertained
that bad women multiply the seduction of heedless youth more rapidly
than bad men seduce modest women. A few of these courtesans
suffice to corrupt whole cities, and there can be no doubt that some
insinuating prostitutes have initiated more young men into these
destructive ways, than the most abandoned rakes have debauched
virgins during their whole lives.</p>

<p>"We have ascertained that the mischiefs of this enormous evil are
greatly aggravated by the persons who keep the brothels and houses
of assignation in this city, many of whom live by the prostitution of
others under their roof, accumulate large property as the wages of
their iniquity, and yet boast of their own personal integrity and place
their children out of the reach, as they think, of this pestiferous example.

<!-- page 13 -->

The price of boarding, paid by the abandoned women in this
city to those who accommodate them, varies from three to fifteen
dollars a Week, according to the style of their accommodations, but is
generally five or six dollars per week for white women.</p>

<p>"The following is an attempt at estimating the <i>probable expense</i>,
or aggregate amount of the annual cost of the 10,000 harlots in this
city:</p>

<table class="small">

<tr><td>For</td><td><i>boarding</i></td><td>1st</td><td>class,</td><td>suppose</td><td>250, at</td><td>$15</td><td>per</td><td>week,</td><td>$ 3,750</td></tr>

<tr><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>2d</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>750, at</td><td>10</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>7,500</td></tr>

<tr><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>3d</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>2,000, at</td><td>7</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>14,000</td></tr>

<tr><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>4th</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>2,000, at</td><td>3</td><td>"</td><td>"</td><td>6,000</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="9"></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="9">Expense of boarding paid by the whole per week,</td><td>$31,250</td></tr>

</table>

<p>"Which multiplied by the number of weeks in the year make the
annual amount of nearly <i>three millions of dollars!!</i> being paid for
the boarding alone of the unhappy daughters of infamy in a single
year.</p>

<p>"Now if we add to this the probable expense of <i>clothes, theatre
tickets, coach hire, wines, and spirituous liquors,</i> and other expenses
incidental to their mode of life, which as we learn from the best
evidence far exceeds the amount paid weekly for board, We think it a
moderate estimate, when we express our conviction that <i>six millions of
dollars</i> is annually expended in this city by prostitutes, all of which
besides what many of them accumulate in the banks and other property,
is paid to them by the guilty companions of their iniquity.</p>

<p>"What an awful waste of property, apart from any higher consideration,
and what proportion of this immense annual amount is
honestly acquired by those who thus expend it, who can say? or
rather what proportion is robbed from parents, masters, and guardians
by the young men, clerks, apprentices, &amp;c. who infest these sinks of
abomination, who can estimate? More than half is doubtless paid
them by silly and inexperienced youth who have no means of supporting
their extravagance, but by embezzling or stealing the property of
others, and who are made the easy dupes of the arts of these infatuating
furies, whose syren song lulls conscience to sleep, and thus prepares
for any and every crime.</p>

<p>"We have ascertained from various sources that each female of this
class is visited on the average by <i>three</i> men or boys <i>daily</i>, and that
each of these spend at least <i>fifty cents</i> for liquors, porter, &amp;c. besides
the sum paid to the companions of their guilt, and the infamous myrmidons
who procure and keep them. This will show that of the ten

<!-- page 14 -->

million times these women are visited by men for the purposes
of prostitution in the course of a year, <i>five millions of dollars</i> are expended in
addition to the items included in the above estimate.</p>

<p>"From the reformed women in the several Asylums, it is ascertained
that it is no uncommon thing for them to receive from ten to twenty
dollars of a night, and frequently from Saturday night to Monday
morning they will receive fifteen to twenty-five men, and obtain as
their reward from thirty to fifty dollars. These items will go far to
sustain the justness of our former calculations, and are intended to
afford some idea of the stupendous expenses of this one single vice,
the cause of so much pauperism and crime; filling our alms-houses,
hospitals, prisons and penitentiaries, and destroying our race.</p>

<p>"But what is all this waste of wealth compared with the ruin of the
generation of young men, and the destruction of female purity? It is
insignificant when compared to the overthrow of the peace of families,
the premature dissolution of broken hearted parents, the wretchedness
and disgrace of community. But all this is as the dust in the balance,
when weighed beside the loss of hundreds of thousands of immortal
souls. All else is worse than worthless when viewed in the light of
the eternal world, for 'her house is the way to death, and her path lays
hold on hell.'</p>

<p>"In a former part of this report we have hinted at the cruelty with
which very many of these guilty and unfortunate girls are treated by
those in whose houses they are kept in a state worse than Algerine
slavery. In many of the houses some broken down rake is kept by
the women who board the girls, in the double capacity of pimp and
bully, or house dog. When any benevolent person visits the house
for the purpose of persuading the females to leave their sinful courses,
this vagabond interferes and either compels the visitor to leave the
house, or forcibly conveys the girls into another apartment. If a girl
shows a desire to reform, drugs are given her in her drink to stupefy
her senses, and she is often cruelly beaten by this monster in the form
of a man.</p>

<p>"Another means practiced by these wretches who keep many of
these houses of ill-fame, to retain the girls whose ruin their arts have
accomplished, is to own the clothes they wear, and when one wishes
to go, she has no clothes; and even when they have clothes of their
own, their mistresses will often forcibly detain them under the pretext
of debt, numerous instances of which have come to our knowledge.
When, as is often the case, the clothes worn by the girls belong to the
keeper of the house, the wages of their iniquity is also withheld from

<!-- page 15 -->

them, they receiving only their board, and the liquor which is freely
given to make them contented with their cruel bondage.</p>

<p>"Many of these houses are provided throughout with hired furniture,
and often of an elegant kind. We have the names and residence
of men in this city who follow this low business, hiring out furniture
by the week at extravagant prices to such houses.</p>

<p>"Another fact as sustained by abundant proof in our possession,
and one in which every class of the community is interested is, that
there are hundreds if not thousands of female domestics in this city,
who serve in respectable families, who visit the houses of assignation
at convenient intervals, sometimes nightly, and by returning in tolerable
season, escape detection by a lie in their mouths, and mingle
with the daughters, in the families where they live, passing for virtuous
women. One of these who has forsaken her evil ways, states that
she met one man every Tuesday night, and another every Friday
night, for months together without missing a single night, and without
ever incurring suspicion.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible however to compress within any reasonable
limits the multiplied mischiefs, and disgusting details of this single
iniquity as known to us, by reason of our brief connection with the
Magdalen Society. Enough we think has been presented to awaken
the feelings of every parent in this community.</p>

<p>"Out of a number of interesting cases, we select the following,
suppressing the real names for obvious reasons:</p>

<p>"A&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;, &aelig;t 21, daughter of respectable and pious parents
in a neighboring city, at a very early age was seduced from her home
under the promise of marriage by a young man who took her by sea
to a southern port, where he kept her for a time and then left her in a
brothel in a strange city. She now gave herself up to a life of prostitution,
and went from one city to another until she came to New
York, where she has been the last two years. Her drunkenness and
crime have taken her more than once to the penitentiary, and she had
well nigh ruined her health. Last winter she was turned out of the
brothel in which she lived in consequence of a quarrel with the woman
who occupied it, and with whom she boarded. She had been sick for
some weeks, disabled from pursuing her guilty means of livelihood,
her clothes had found their way to the pawn-brokers, or been exchanged
for ardent spirits, and at midnight she was turned into the
street without any other garment than a ragged calico frock, filthy
beyond description, without bonnet or shoes, in one of the coldest
nights of the last winter. She wandered through the street, drunk

<!-- page 16 -->

from the excesses of the previous night, and was found in the morning
about day light, standing in an alley near the 'Five Points' and
brought, shivering with cold, to the Probationary House. Her face
and limbs were bloated by intemperance, and the effects of the frost
seemed to have stupefied her reason, and well nigh destroyed her life.
By the most careful nursing and medical attention she was restored,
in a few days, to tolerable health, but the effects of the frost on her
feet continued for months. From the first she exhibited the liveliest
gratitude for her deliverance, and manifested a disposition to render
cheerful obedience to all the rules of the house. Soon she became
interested in the religious services of the house, and was taken to the
Asylum, and shortly after gave satisfactory evidence of a change of
heart. Ever since she has adorned her profession, and formed habits
of cleanliness and industry."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the life and condition of the lost and unfortunate
women of New York. It exhibits a degree of degradation, of misery
and of wo unspeakable.</p>

<p>This report, made nearly eighteen years ago, even then in the opinion
of the best informed, underrated the number of these unfortunate
women. Since that period the population of the city and its suburbs
has nearly doubled itself; and as vice outstrips population, we may
reasonably infer that full Twenty Thousand Prostitutes, both public
and private, are now plying their lamentable trade in the city of New
York.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE MODEL ARTISTE.</p>

</div>

<p>LOITER with me, reader, some afternoon on the Battery. There
you will behold many beautiful, but frail women.</p>

<p>It was in the month of May, just before the sun was sinking to his
golden bed. I was seated with a companion on the Battery, near the
entrance to Castle Garden.</p>

<p>Soon there passed a lady of beautiful form and most lovely countenance,
yet seemingly saddened by some secret sorrow. Her slender
form and damask cheek told too plainly that the blossoms of her life
were withering, and that she was in the incipient stages of consumption.
But this disease, though it had dimmed the healthful and lively
expression of her features, yet had rendered them even more lovely
and interesting to behold.</p>

<p>My companion spoke, and asked: "Can you tell who that girl is?"</p>

<p>"No; I never saw her before," replied I.</p>

<p>"I can tell you who she is&mdash;she is a model artiste. Sit still a moment,
and I will speak to her."</p>

<p>My companion was gone for a moment, and, after having spoken
with the lady, returned.</p>

<p>"There is something very interesting in the history of that girl,"
said he, resuming his seat by my side.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear it, and would like to know, too, what effect
her taking the part of a model artiste has had upon her morals. Has
she fallen? or what is her character?"</p>

<p>"She has fallen, but it was not the exhibition of herself as a model
artiste that ruined her."</p>

<p>"The wily arts of some seducer, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"It was not the wily arts of any seducer."</p>

<p>"Her own wanton disposition, then, led her astray?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not that, either."</p>

<p>"How, then, did she fall from the high estate of virtue?"</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>"Well, I am going to see her this evening, and you may, if you
please, go along, and perhaps she may tell the story of her wrongs
from her own lips."</p>

<p>"I should like to go, and, if possible, draw from her the facts of her
own history."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Evening came, and we set out to call on the model artiste. We
found her in a small house in Twelfth-streel, boarding with a widow
lady.</p>

<p>As we entered, she was introduced to me as Miss Jane Morrison.
She had a small room on the second floor, plainly, but comfortably
furnished.</p>

<p>We found her reading the Bible, and her eyes somewhat swollen
and red, as though she had just recovered from a fit of tears. Her
countenance was intelligent, and rendered more lovely by a tinge of
melancholy sadness, that was rendered more apparent by the cheerful
smile she strove to wear.</p>

<p>"You have not come to arrest me, I hope?" were the first words
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Surely not," said my companion; "you would not deem me so
base as thus to betray you."</p>

<p>"No, I hope not. With all my sin, I have never yet been to prison.
That would crush me at once. All I desire is to be permitted to live
and die in peace."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing from us," I said; "we are your friends, and have
come to see if we can do you any good."</p>

<p>These remarks seemed to compose her mind; and after some
further conversation, we at last succeeded in inducing her to reveal to
us the history of her life.</p>

<p>She was born, she said, in Orange county, New York, and at the
age of twelve, lost her mother. Within a year or two afterward she
came under the care of a step-mother. The result was what might
be anticipated. She was aggrieved, or fancied herself aggrieved,
and left her home at the age of seventeen.</p>

<p>She came to the City of New York, and resided for some time with
a female cousin who was married to a man in moderate circumstances.
Here she acquired the art and mystery of dress-making, and was
accustomed to "work out in families," by which means she obtained
a respectable living.</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>"My ruin," she said, "was wrought by a man of high standing in
society. He resides within sight of Union Square, and he was then,
and still is, a member of Calvary Church."</p>

<p>We pressed her to reveal his name, but she refused.</p>

<p>"Nothing would induce me to disclose his name. O, I have loved
that man!" said she, wringing her hands in grief. "He is married,
and I would not expose him for the world."</p>

<p>"How did you form your acquaintance with this man?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"It was at the model artistes," she answered, blushingly.</p>

<p>"How happened it that you joined the company?"</p>

<p>"My health had failed me, and the physicians told me I must
abandon the needle or die. By the advice of some friends, I went to
a water-cure establishment, and remained until I had spent all my
money. I had not sufficiently recovered to be able to resume my
occupation with the needle; and being without money and a home, I
went to my cousin's, and remained for a short time. While there, I
perceived that I was not welcome&mdash;and indeed they had not the means
to accommodate me. Still, in order to help all I could, I did what
sewing I was able, which was fast bringing back my malady&mdash;a pain
in the side&mdash;in an aggravated form. What could I then do?"</p>

<p>"Why did you not apply to your friends for assistance?"</p>

<p>"I had depended on my cousin until she was almost ready to turn
me out of doors!"</p>

<p>"Had you not other friends who would have extended to you some
aid?"</p>

<p>"The poor, you know, have no friends. There were some ladies
for whom I had worked that had been friendly to me, and I applied to
them, but without success, except in one instance, and that was the
wife of Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, the one of whom I have spoken as the cause of my
fall. But I should not say he was the cause."</p>

<p>"Who, then, was the cause?"</p>

<p>"It was want&mdash;it was my dependent, desolate, suffering condition
that was the cause of my departure from the path of right. Some
assistance I received from Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, but I could not long depend
on her. One day, when strolling through the streets, scarcely knowing
whither I was going, and absorbed in thinking over my destitute,
and, as it seemed to me, hopeless condition, I met a young lady, an
acquaintance of mine, dressed in silk, with a gay hat and an elegant
shawl, and seeming to be very happy.</p>

<p>" 'Why do you look so sad?' said she.</p>

<p>" 'I cannot help it,' replied I.</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>" 'I know what is the matter,' said she, 'you are killing yourself
with the needle; and because you are unable to work, you are suffering
with want. Cheer up, I'll tell you how you can get some money.'</p>

<p>" 'I should like to get some money, but I would not do anything
out of the way,' said I, suspecting that Emma (for that was her name,)
had dressed herself in that style by means of the wages of sin.</p>

<p>" 'I can tell you, Jane, how you can do it in a respectable way.
You do not think I would throw myself away for money, do you?'</p>

<p>" 'O, no, I do not think you would; but I do not know how I could
earn anything and be respectable.'</p>

<p>" 'Do it as I do.'</p>

<p>" 'How is that?'</p>

<p>" 'By the model artistes.'</p>

<p>" 'Do you think that I would exhibit myself in that manner before
an audience of men?'</p>

<p>" 'To be sure you would. There is no harm in it. Some of the
most respectable ladies in the city are in our company. I once felt
as you do, but I have got over it now. Come along with me; our
manager wants to engage just such a person as you. You have a
beautiful form, you will take well, and can get a high salary. Come
along; let us go to Taylor's and get some oysters, and then go with
me to Pinteux's to the rehearsal. Come along.'</p>

<p>"With these words, and especially the invitation to take some
oysters, I was induced to accompany her to Taylor's saloon, and from
thence to Pinteux's.</p>

<p>"At Pinteux's I witnessed the rehearsal, at which I experienced a
shock to my feelings; yet, being on the brink of starvation, I yielded
to the entreaties of my companion and to the solicitations of the manager,
and made an engagement at fifteen dollars per week, with a promise
of an increase to twenty dollars. Perhaps I should not even then
have accepted this offer, had not the manager, perceiving my destitute
condition, presented me with five dollars in advance.</p>

<p>"I now left with Emma, and took board at the same house with her.
On the following day, I attended with her again, to take part myself,
for the first time, in the rehearsal.</p>

<p>"My feelings soon became inured to the exhibition, and I was able
to go through my part in a manner that gave satisfaction. But the
only gratifying circumstance connected with the engagement, was the
income it afforded, which gave to me a comfortable support and an
honorable independence.</p>

<p>"But on a sudden this bright vision passed away. From the height

<!-- page 21 -->

of my prosperity, I was plunged at once into the deepest abyss of
misery.</p>

<p>"You perhaps may remember that Sunday night when the police
made a descent on the Pinteux company. I was then hurried off,
shivering in the cold, to prison.</p>

<p>"O! the horror&mdash;the indescribable anguish of that dreadful night!
I can never recall its scenes without shuddering! I was frantic. I
was in prison, and for what? Not for theft or murder. That I could
have endured, for they dethrone not woman's virtue.</p>

<p>"But I was imprisoned, degraded for indecency, for a crime of all
others the most humiliating and painful to woman. I was in despair,
too, at the loss of my living and of all my hopes.</p>

<p>"In this desperate and distressing situation, a hand of kindness was
extended to me. Was it not natural that I should seize on it?"</p>

<p>"Did some friend, then, come to your aid?" asked I.</p>

<p>"While drowned in tears and absorbed in anguish at the prospect
before me, a gentleman appeared and spoke gently to me. I looked
up and beheld Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, the husband of the lady for whom I had
formerly worked, and who had befriended me when I was in want.</p>

<p>"In the morning, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; came again, and procuring my discharge,
took me under his charge. My living was gone, and he supported
me. I could not starve, and consequently I yielded, and&mdash;was&mdash;lost&mdash;lost
for ever!" And uttering these words, she burst into a
violent paroxysm of tears.</p>

<p>From the friend that accompanied me, I learned that this girl had,
after a short time, been abandoned by the pious gentleman who had
taken her under his <i>Christian protection</i>, and had been compelled to
make another engagement in the company of model artistes, at
Pinteux's.</p>

<p>My friend informed me that she was the chief attraction of the company.
Her form was one of perfect symmetry, and faultless proportions,
and the Grecian outline of her features were cast in an expression
of angelic mildness and love. Added to this, her graceful and
natural attitudes made her one of the most beautiful sights to behold.
She was the favorite of the company, and was always received with
loud applause.</p>

<p>Those who witnessed her personation of the Greek Slave, have
avowed that her figure and her graceful ease surpassed that of the
creation of the genius of Powers. Also, her representation of Venus
coming from the bath, and other characters, were distinguished by
the modesty and grace of her demeanor and attitudes, which, together

<!-- page 22 -->

with the beauty of her form and features, rendered the exhibition one
that might enrapture the artist and pure minded lover of nature.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, such exhibitions are notoriously of an immoral
tendency, and cannot be too strongly condemned.</p>

<p>This poor girl, after having been thus abandoned, again sought employment,
and appeared at Pinteux's, Palmo's, and at the Temple of
the Muses, until these exhibitions were broken up by the authorities,
when she soon became reduced to the destitute condition in which we
found her in the house in Twelfth-street.</p>

<p>At the time we visited her, she had become indebted for board and
was penniless. To add to her misery, she was now fast fading away
before the burning influence of a quick consumption.</p>

<p>After having afforded her the means of temporary relief, we departed,
promising to call again.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A week or two afterward, with my friend, I visited for the last time
this poor, unfortunate girl.</p>

<p>She was now fast sinking into the grave. Her cheeks were flushed
with the hectic hue of death, and formed a beautiful contrast with the
pale wanness of her interesting countenance, whose expression seemed
to grow more lovely as she approached the confines of another world.</p>

<p>We found her sitting in an arm-chair, and, as on the former occasion,
with the Bible in her hands, endeavoring to draw from that
sacred book the consolations there held out to the forlorn and the
forsaken.</p>

<p>Pearly tear-drops trickled down her sunken cheeks, as she greeted
us with a pleasant smile that seemed like a gleam of sunlight breaking
through the misty rain-drops of a gentle shower.</p>

<p>Poor girl! Doomed early in life to trials too severe for her tender
years, she had fallen into the deep abyss of wo, and at a time when
she had once hoped to enter on all the duties and enjoyments of which
the young heart is susceptible, without reputation, without friends,
without home, she was sinking silently to the dust, unloved, unwept,
and unremembered. Often she recalled the fond caresses and the
tender love of her mother. Now, in her last dying moments, that
mother was gone, never more to return! O! were she now present,
with what an aching heart and tearful eyes would she press this forlorn
child to her bosom, and watch over her until the last flickering light
of life had died out! A father she had, but no father's care was now

<!-- page 23 -->

extended over her. Brothers she had, but they were not with her.
Her sister, too, whom, to have seen in her own condition, would have
broken her heart&mdash;she, too, was away and unknowing of her fate.
Unpitied and alone, with no sympathizing companions save her own
unstayed tears, she was leaving the busy crowds of the world, to enter
on the untried and unknown future. Her hopes, once high as heaven,
were now sunk in the deepest abyss of despair! Her heart, formed
for all the affections and endearments of life, was now just as its capabilities
were developed, was about to cease to beat for ever!</p>

<p>Alas! how inscrutable are the ways of Providence! How often
are the guileless led into sin! How often the beautiful and the good
doomed to the pangs of misery and the melancholy fate of an early
grave!</p>

<p>But let us not murmur! Rather bow with submission to the decrees
of an All-Wise Providence.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>After a few moments conversation with Miss Morrison, relative to
her health and condition, she became calm, for she had at first been
much affected on our entering the room.</p>

<p>I having referred to her situation, she replied:</p>

<p>"I know I must soon die! The green fields and the warbling
brooks that I loved when a child, I shall never see again. Home,
father, brother and sister, I have seen them for the last time, and now
I am to die alone and among strangers." With these words, she fell
to violent weeping.</p>

<p>Again she became calm, and requested an account of her conduct
to be sent to her father, with the reasons that induced her to join the
company of the model artistes.</p>

<p>"I wish," said she, "my father to know the true reasons that induced
me to join the company."</p>

<p>"Does he already know that you have been a member of the company?"
inquired I.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has heard, and not knowing the cause of it, was very
angry with me; and that is the reason I could not return to my home
when this last illness came upon me."</p>

<p>"But did you not explain the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"No; I never wrote to him after I knew he had found it out, and
was offended at me for it."</p>

<p>"Had you told him all the circumstances, he would have forgiven
you."</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>"Perhaps he might; but he is a stern man, and I was from that
time afraid to write. But I now wish him to know that it was want
which brought me to it&mdash;the cause that drove me to it." And as she
said these words, her tears broke forth afresh.</p>

<p>Soon after this we left, promising to call again on the morrow, but
that morrow she never lived to see.</p>

<p>When we called again, the lady with whom she had boarded met
us at the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Poor girl, she's gone now; I was sorry for her, she seemed to be
so good and to suffer so much in her mind."</p>

<p>"But she died sooner than you anticipated?" inquired we.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor thing; she took on greatly after you left, saying she
wished she could go home. She said her father would forgive her,
and she wanted to write to him to come after her."</p>

<p>"That is what we intended to do; we were about to write to her
father, that he might reach here before she died."</p>

<p>"She got her paper and was sitting down to write, when her feelings
overcame her, and she fell to crying most bitterly. This started the
blood from her lungs, and she then soon fell away," said the old lady,
wiping a tear from her eye.</p>

<p>She resumed again, saying:</p>

<p>"The girl seemed to think every thing of her father, for she talked
of him as long as life lasted."</p>

<p>"How long did she live?"</p>

<p>"But about two hours after the bleeding commenced; and the last
thing she said was, 'O, my father, I have offended thee! My mother,
I am going to meet you! May the Lord have mercy on my soul!'
And with these words, her speech was gone."</p>

<p>Such was the career and unfortunate termination of the life of a
beautiful, intelligent, and interesting young girl, who had left a
pleasant and comfortable home in the country, for the dangers and
temptations of a city life.</p>

<p>When will girls, who have good homes in the country, learn to be
content, and to shun the devouring maelstroms of a corrupt and
corrupting city?</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE THREE SISTERS&mdash;AS MODEL ARTISTES.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the Police court appears a group of interesting females&mdash;three
of them young and beautiful&mdash;the elder a round, plump, good-looking
widow of forty, and the mother of the other three.</p>

<p>She is a magnificent looking woman, tall, stately, of full, round
proportions, almost giant-like in dimensions. Her complexion is
florid, her hair of a bright glossy brown, and her eyes full and languishing,
indicating a sensual and voluptuous disposition.</p>

<p>The nature of the business that brought her thither is explained by
the affidavit in which she had sworn,</p>

<p>"That her three daughters, Isabella &mdash;&mdash;, Louisa &mdash;&mdash;, and
Elizabeth &mdash;&mdash;, conducted themselves in a disorderly manner, and
will not obey the instructions or authority of their parent, but against
deponent's consent and orders, exhibited themselves in an unbecoming
manner and against public decency and good morals, by appearing
before the public in an undress, as <i>Model Artistes</i>, much to their disgrace,
and as deponent fears, leading to their ruin. Deponent further
says that she has seen her daughters, named aforesaid, appear at a
public exhibition held at Palmo's Theatre, in Chambers-street, in the
manner as set forth aforesaid. Deponent therefore prays that her
daughters named aforesaid, may be arrested and dealt with as the law
directs in such cases made and provided."</p>

<p>Isabella, the eldest of the truant daughters, was about twenty-one
years of age, of medium stature, but graceful form, and an expressive
countenance, indicative of deep passion.</p>

<p>Louisa, the second sister, was eighteen, taller, of a more beautiful
form, and of a blonde complexion, lively and expressive features, distinguished
by great beauty. She was a most beautiful model.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the youngest, and yet the tallest and most beautiful of
the three, was less than sixteen. Her form was faultless&mdash;of a full
voluptuous bust&mdash;tall, yet not thin, but of a full and gracefully turned

<!-- page 26 -->

contour&mdash;in stature resembling Powers' Greek Slave, but in development
more like the celebrated Venus de Medicis. Her Grecian features
seemed lit with the Promethean fire of genius, and wore an
expression of divine loveliness.</p>

<p>Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon, renowned as the most
beautiful woman of her age, and whom the great Canova obtained to
appear in his studio as a model, was not more beautiful than the
youngest of these sisters.</p>

<p>The proportions of Elizabeth, embodied in marble, stand as
a more fitting emblem of female beauty than the Greek Slave of
Powers.</p>

<p>Such were the three model artistes, and here they were before the
tribunal of justice, with their mother as their accuser.</p>

<p>The examination proceeded, and the following developments were
made, which exhibit a most startling condition in the morals of the
society of this Babylon of the New World.</p>

<p>One morning last winter the manager of Palmo's was visited by a
large, noble-looking woman, dressed in plain style, who was the mother
of these three daughters.</p>

<p>"I have come," said she, "in answer to the advertisement I saw in
the 'Sun,' for girls, who it is said can have light employment and good
wages."</p>

<p>"Take a seat," replied the manager.</p>

<p>"What is the nature of the employment?" asked the lady, taking
a chair.</p>

<p>"It is to appear in our company," said the manager with a bland
smile.</p>

<p>"Your company; that is, the model artistes, I suppose," said the
lady not the least abashed.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the manager, "we have a fine company, and are
all very respectable ladies too."</p>

<p>"I fear it will not be a proper place for young ladies."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing on that score. The young ladies of my establishment
are all well protected."</p>

<p>"There are some ladies of my acquaintance that wished me to
call and inquire into the nature of the employment, and what the pay
would be."</p>

<p>"Well, it depends on the young ladies. If they are well adapted
for the performance, they shall have good salaries&mdash;from nine to fifteen
dollars a week."</p>

<p>"They are, I believe, very beautiful girls."</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"Will you not come and bring the young ladies with you and witness
the performances?"</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and the buxom widow departed.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The widow returned to her home.</p>

<p>"What news, mother?" inquired all the daughters at once, as she
entered the house.</p>

<p>"O! good news! It is the model artistes. He will give from nine
to fifteen dollars a week, and has invited us to come and see the
performance."</p>

<p>"I should not like to go and sit among all the men and look on.
Are there any ladies in the audience?" asked Isabella.</p>

<p>"I do not know; but he will give us a private box, where we can
see and not be seen."</p>

<p>"O, that is good. I should like to go," said one of the younger
girls.</p>

<p>The mother and her three daughters repaired to Palmo's and were
provided with a private box. They witnessed the exhibition and were
satisfied they should be willing to appear in it.</p>

<p>Before the performance was closed, the manager entered the box,
and inquired:</p>

<p>"How do you like the performance, ladies?"</p>

<p>"We are satisfied with it," replied the lady, at the same time
saying: "these are the young ladies who wish to engage in the
company."</p>

<p>The manager, after viewing them with delight for a few moments,
asked:</p>

<p>"Do they wish to make the engagement themselves?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are willing."</p>

<p>"Do they reside in the city?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In what street?"</p>

<p>"In Suffolk-street."</p>

<p>"Have they parents?"</p>

<p>"They have a mother."</p>

<p>"And you are the mother? There is a family likeness," said the
manager, having eagerly eyed them for a moment.</p>

<p>"I confess I am the mother," replied she.</p>

<p>The party now retired to the manager's room, and a bargain was

<!-- page 30 -->

agreed on, by which the daughters were to have nine dollars per
week, after they should have properly qualified themselves by repeated
rehearsals.</p>

<p>The girls regularly appeared with the mother at the rehearsals, and
at length made their <i>debut</i> before the public.</p>

<p>At first their embarrassment was so great that it was with difficulty
they could preserve their attitude; but they soon gained steady nerves,
and went through their parts with much eclat. The younger in particular,
was greatly admired, and became famous among the bloods
for her magnificent form and graceful attitudes.</p>

<p>Had this been all of the model artistes, perhaps it had been well for
them; but other trials and temptations awaited these doomed victims.</p>

<p>The nature of these temptations may be gathered from the following
scene, which took place one evening at the close of the performance:</p>

<p>"I say, Bob, where did you get that Venus coming from the bath?"
eagerly asked a young man dressed in the very height of fashion, as
he entered the private room of the manager at the fall of the curtain
one evening.</p>

<p>"She is a New York gal, and I have got in the company her two
sisters also, who are almost equally beautiful," replied the manager,
who seemed to be on familiar terms with the visitor, whose name was
Frank Colton.</p>

<p>"But you must introduce me to her at once," said Frank, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Ah! no; I can't do that. I have promised that pleasure to
another. But I can introduce you to her sister next older. She is a
perfect beauty."</p>

<p>Soon another gentleman entered.</p>

<p>It was the one who was to be introduced to the youngest sister.
He was also a young man dressed in rich and fashionable style.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen were introduced to the two youngest sisters,
and accompanied by the manager and the elder sister, sat down to an
oyster-supper, at which they all freely partook of champagne.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the mother, who generally accompanied her
daughters, was this evening persuaded to go home alone and leave
the young ladies under the protection of the manager, who promised
to see them safely home.</p>

<p>The sisters had seen little of the world, and at home had suffered
at times much for want of the comforts of life, and had, too, become
partly alienated in their affections toward their mother in consequence
of her tyrannical and sometimes cruel treatment, arising from her bad

<!-- page 31 -->

temper, and occasional immoderate use of strong drink. They therefore
naturally felt pleased with the attentions paid them, and were
easily led on from step to step to the abyss of ruin.</p>

<p>The school of the model artistes was a most corrupt one; destroying
all of purity and virtue that came in contact with it.</p>

<p>Though most of those forming the company of exhibitors had previously
become so hardened in iniquity as to receive no additional
injury from its contaminating influences, yet many others who possessed
both virtue and beauty, were induced by suffering and want
to enter the vortex of this devouring maelstrom, and once within
its influence, they were drawn by giddy whirls to the bottom of
perdition.</p>

<p>Thanks to an enlightened and respectable portion of the community,
they have been put down, never, we trust, to re-appear again.</p>

<p>The person who introduced this corrupting exhibition into the
United States, is a person by the name of Collyer, an Englishman,
who has hitherto led an itinerant life, in the character first of a pretended
phrenologist, and afterward of a mesmeriser, in which last
character he at one time became quite notorious in Boston.</p>

<p>One word as to the character of the audiences.</p>

<p>The spectators were many of them lecherous old and dissipated
young men. Many visited a night or two out of curiosity, and among
these were a large number of strangers from other parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The result of the examination before the police may be briefly
stated.</p>

<p>It appears that the manager and the mother had fallen into
some disagreement; the latter alledging that her daughters were
subjected to improper influences; and the former charging that the
mother was intemperate and troublesome, and therefore he had been
obliged to eject her from the theatre.</p>

<p>Hence the complaint by the mother.</p>

<p>The daughters, who had become corrupted and attached to the new
scenes and excitements in this path of life, sided with the manager,
and desired to remain in the company. Denying that they were under
any improper influence, they were allowed to depart, while the manager
was released on nominal bail.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE COUNTERFEITERS.</p>

</div>

<p>AT midnight, wander through this city.</p>

<p>Look upon the countless houses and reflect what is going on
within.</p>

<p>Yonder is the peaceful sleep of innocence, and beneath that other
roof skulks the guilty murderer, trembling at his own shadow.</p>

<p>Here we behold the wearied and sated with luxury, and there
poverty in its squalor and rags lies down on a bed of straw, gnawed
by the anguish of hunger and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Pause now in front of that respectable looking house. In the rear
is a building, beneath whose roof and within its bolted doors are seven
men in their shirt-sleeves, all hard at work.</p>

<p>They are counterfeiting the notes of one of our banks, and the silver
coin of our country.</p>

<p>Silver, and other metals, and engravings on steel, piles of notes, and
base coin, fill the safe.</p>

<p>Along the narrow alley is heard a step approaching the house in
the rear.</p>

<p>"Down with your hammer, and not a word from one of you,"
murmured the man on guard, in trembling tones.</p>

<p>"Hush, now: some one is coming. Hustle those notes into the
safe. Put every thing into the safe and lower it into the vault.
Spring for your lives!" uttered a low voice within.</p>

<p>"Whitney, who can it be? There are more than one of them. It
must be a band of police!" exclaimed the guard in terror.</p>

<p>"Hush all your fears," said the low voice which was that of Whitney,
who seemed to be the leader of the gang. "No man shall be
admitted, and whoever attempts to force his way shall receive a silent
slung-shot or a pistol-ball."</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>"Haulsey!" again exclaimed the guard in fear, "blow out that
light in an instant, for there stands several persons in the street looking
up the alley."</p>

<p>"See that the doors are all fastened, and let every man arm himself,
for if any attempt should be made, blood will be spilled," said Whitney,
in a low but firm tone.</p>

<p>"They are all bolted. But, look! For God's sake, keep still.
Do you hear that voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Whitney; "and from this window I will answer if any
of them speak."</p>

<p>"What are you at work for at this late hour of the night?" asked a
voice from without, in a bold tone.</p>

<p>"Whitney, tell him you are laboring for your bread&mdash;tell him
quick," uttered the guard in almost breathless suspense.</p>

<p>"I am, sir," answered Whitney, "hard at work in making packing-boxes
for a merchant in Cedar-street, if you must know what is none
of your business."</p>

<p>"But why do you work so late?"</p>

<p>"Because the boxes must be done to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"But we have our doubts as to your occupation. We must therefore
enter and satisfy ourselves of this."</p>

<p>"We grant no admission, and especially at this late hour."</p>

<p>"Men, try that door and see if an entrance can be effected," said
the leader of the band outside.</p>

<p>"The door seems strongly barred and locked," answered one of
the men who with two or three others had tried it.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to break in upon my premises? I have told you
my business, and at this time of night I cannot admit any one. Is not
that enough?"</p>

<p>"No; we have our doubts, and if you resist our demands, we shall
be strengthened in our suspicions."</p>

<p>"If you persist in your attempts to enter, I shall blow your brains
out," exclaimed Whitney, brandishing a revolver in his hand. "At
my call, I have men who will come to my assistance, and we shall be
more than a match for you."</p>

<p>"Ah! you rascal, you have deceived me then; you are not
making packing boxes; you are doing that for which you should be
arrested."</p>

<p>"Whitney! Whitney! let us first get the safe and all things secure
in the vault," said one of the men within, in a low voice, touching
Whitney on the shoulder.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>"Yes; do it, while I talk to them outside. Be quick, and fear not,"
returned Whitney, with a sullen grin.</p>

<p>"Shall we light a lamp?" asked the younger of the seven.</p>

<p>"Yes! There is nothing to fear, boys. They are now moving off,"
said Whitney, shutting the chamber window.</p>

<p>"Oh, d&mdash;n the luck," exclaimed Whitney. "Boys, we must conceal
the notes on our persons, and secure the silver."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"We must be off to other quarters. We are suspected, and we
must move at once."</p>

<p>"Move from Mercer-street or you are lost!"</p>

<p>"My God! did you hear that voice? Is it a ghost, or a voice from
the other world? Do you hear it, boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but where did it come from? What means it?"</p>

<p>"Move from Mercer-street or you are lost!"</p>

<p>"My God! that voice again! Can it be a ghost! Men, what do
you think?" exclaimed Whitney, with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"It must be some one behind the brick walls. At any rate, we
must move, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to it. What voice is that?"</p>

<p>"There comes no answer! But let us listen for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"It is no voice; it must have been but imagination," said Whitney,
the leader of the gang.</p>

<p>"Let us then proceed to business," said several voices, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Shall we go up to Albany, and there carry on our business, or
where shall we go?" asked one of the company.</p>

<p>"No, not to Albany, for it is too near those high walls at Auburn,"
answered another.</p>

<p>"Then let us go to Greenport; that is a retired spot where we can
operate without disturbance."</p>

<p>"No, that won't do&mdash;it is too far down the island; for, after all,
New York must be the place for head-quarters."</p>

<p>"That is according to my mind. But what do you say, Whitney,
in regard to this?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, men. My life has been passed amid such scenes,
and this does not alarm me. Our business is now flourishing, and to
keep it so, New York is the place for head-quarters."</p>

<p>"But do you know of a good place?"</p>

<p>"I have my eye, this very minute, on a house where, in times past,

<!-- page 35 -->

the business of counterfeiting was carried on for years, without
exciting the least suspicion;"</p>

<p>"And you say it was never found out?"</p>

<p>"Never has it been suspected. It is in a good location."</p>

<p>"Where is it&mdash;in Broadway?"</p>

<p>"No! not in that thoroughfare, but I know I could obtain one or
more rooms in it this very night. I could get the cellar where I know
there are secret vaults the police would never detect."</p>

<p>"Good! Is that really so? Then that is the place: let us have
it."</p>

<p>"Secret vaults are there, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Go ask that one who has had his respite from the gallows some
half-a-dozen times," said Whitney.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean? Leman?"</p>

<p>"No; but one with whom I have had much intercourse, and one
who was brought up among the first in the city, and who used to say
his catechism when a boy as well as I did."</p>

<p>"Whom, then, can it be?"</p>

<p>"It is Babe the pirate, yonder. Poor fellow! he has had affliction
and misery enough in his day."</p>

<p>"But where is the place you spoke of?" asked one of the company.
"If we were in Philadelphia or Baltimore, I would know where to go
to, but I don't know this New York as well."</p>

<p>Whitney now rose from his chair, and turning his long black
hair from his narrow forehead, called in his men to listen, when he
was interrupted by the guard, who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"We had better remain quiet for a few minutes!"</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked one of the men, "is the police gang returning?"
At the same time, he and Whitney advanced toward the window to
look out.</p>

<p>"No," answered the guard, "but some one seems to be watching
the building!"</p>

<p>Whitney soon returned, and gave his men assurance of no cause
for alarm. He then arranged his plans and gave directions for the
removal from this building.</p>

<p>"Having now arranged all things, shall I go this moment and
engage the place I have in view?" asked their leader.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply of all.</p>

<p>"I will soon depart, and take Hooper with me, and in one hour we
will return to you again," said Whitney, as he departed with his
chosen companions, each of whom was armed with pistols and dirks.</p>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p>"Stop, stop, a moment!" said one of them, "will you tell us where
this house is?"</p>

<p>"There is time enough for all that yet, and on our return you
shall know," said Whitney.</p>

<p>"But I have good reason for asking."</p>

<p>"What is your reason?"</p>

<p>"If you are bound to a place that you know is safe&mdash;one to which
we can go at any time, hadn't you better take the keys of the safe
with you, and deposite them in the cellar?"</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Whitney," said Hooper, "for there is no
telling what a day may bring forth. What say you?"</p>

<p>"It is a lucky thought," replied the leader, as he took the keys and
placed them in a belt he wore about his waist.</p>

<p>They departed, and were soon in Broadway.</p>

<p>Down that thoroughfare they walk, arm in arm, to Canal-street, in
which they enter the house they designed to occupy.</p>

<p>It was occupied by a congenial spirit, who was still up, and with
whom they soon concluded a bargain. Here they remained till the
dawn of day, when they returned to their old haunt in Mercer-street.</p>

<p>Thus they evaded the "vigilance of the police." For though the
police had kept watch of the house, and saw these two men come out,
yet they had been unable to track them to the house in Canal-street.</p>

<p>The policemen thought that if nothing was removed during that
night, no attempt at removal would be made until the next night,
when it was resolved to make a descent on the premises with a strong
force.</p>

<p>In this they were disappointed; for Whitney and his companions
returning at daylight, every thing was in half an hour made ready
for removal.</p>

<p>The police, apprehending no occurrence of this kind during the
day, had left only one man to watch the premises.</p>

<p>Him Whitney easily managed to bribe, and soon a vehicle belonging
to the band took every thing off in a couple of boxes, while the company,
one by one, made their escape, without exciting any suspicion.</p>

<p>The next night they were at work again in their new quarters,
where they remained for a long time, unsuspected and unmolested.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE BETRAYER AND THE BETRAYED.</p>

</div>

<p>LET the reader now, in imagination, enter a well furnished room in
Canal-street, near Thompson. Let it be in the month of March, on a
clear cold day, and at the hour of eleven at night.</p>

<p>For at that time and place, a middle aged man, an actor on the
stage of one of the New York theatres, entered this room, where a
very young woman was then sitting in a pensive and melancholy
mood.</p>

<p>Her appearance was that of a delicate well-bred woman. Her
condition, too, was one that, if unmarried, was sufficient to give cause
for the grief and despair depicted on her countenance. She was soon
to become a mother!</p>

<p>She was dressed in a modest and very pretty style, and seemed to
be about eighteen.</p>

<p>The gentleman, or the stage actor, was dressed in a rich and fashionable
style, with gold watch and chain.</p>

<p>"George! George! can it be that you have at last come to see me
before I die? O! I am glad you have come; I wanted to see you
once more before I leave the world!" said the poor girl, bursting into
a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"Fanny!" said he, "be of good cheer and fear not. I will never
desert you. In me behold your friend!"</p>

<p>"Can I then believe in you? O! tell me and it will relieve me!"
said Fanny.</p>

<p>"As true as there is a God in Heaven! I mean what I say. You
can trust me to the end."</p>

<p>"Thanks, George! my mind is easier. But had you not come this
day, I should have put an end to my sufferings before another sun had
arisen."</p>

<p>"I will stand by you and see that you have every thing you want;
that you are properly provided for and have suitable attendants."</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>Soon after, George departed, promising to return again at three
o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>While this poor girl is left alone reflecting on the contrast between
the innocent pleasures of her early years, and the agonizing sufferings
of her present condition, we will for a few moments revert to her
history.</p>

<p>She was a native of one of the interior towns of this State, and had
been brought up in comfortable circumstances. Her father was a
merchant, but having become involved in his affairs, his mind became
so deranged that it had been found necessary to take him to a lunatic
asylum. Having partially recovered, he was restored to his family,
but soon afterward, in a moment of derangement, he put an end to his
life by his own hands.</p>

<p>Soon after this circumstance, which threw the family into sorrow
and want, Fanny was visited by a female cousin from the city, who
determined her fate.</p>

<p>The cousin painted in the most glowing colors the charms and
pleasures of a city life, and finally succeeded in persuading Fanny
that a good deal of money was to be made by working in artificial
flowers, and that she might thus live independent, dress in good style,
and enjoy the many pleasures a city life affords.</p>

<p>Influenced by these representations, she came to the city and procured
work in a shop in William-street with her cousin.</p>

<p>The current of her life here ran smoothly until, through the introduction
of her cousin, she became acquainted with the actor, who was
familiarly called by her George.</p>

<p>One day, while at work, her cousin inquiringly remarked:
"You have never been to the theatre, have you, Fanny?"
"No; and I do not care to go," replied she.</p>

<p>"O! you would be delighted. You had better go with me to-night.
I am going to have a beautiful gentleman for a beau, and we shall
have a private box."</p>

<p>"I have never been to a theatre, and I don't think I should like to
go. The theatre is not a good place."</p>

<p>"That is one of your country notions. I never saw any thing bad
in the theatre. You had better go along to-night. It is the Bowery,
and the play is to be the Wizard of the Wave. Come, you go&mdash;we
are to have a private box, and we'll have a nice time."</p>

<p>Partly by these representations, and partly impelled by curiosity to
see a theatre for the first time, Fanny was induced to accompany her
cousin.</p>

<!-- page 39 -->

<p>The person who attended them was an attach&eacute; of the theatre, and
had often accompanied her thither, and generally provided them with
a private box.</p>

<p>In this private box George had become acquainted with, and had
often visited this young girl, and when the latter mentioned that
she had a beautiful cousin by the name of Fanny in the city, it
had been arranged that some evening she should bring her to the
theatre.</p>

<p>George, when he had concluded his part on the stage, was to come
to the private box and there be introduced to Fanny.</p>

<p>The plan succeeded as had been arranged.</p>

<p>Fanny went to the theatre, became acquainted with George, and
often repeated her visits.</p>

<p>She soon became attached to him, and under a promise of marriage,
was finally induced to leave her shop and take apartments in Canal-street,
where she was living when first introduced to the reader.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, George returned, and found Fanny on the sofa, in
tears, as usual.</p>

<p>"Well, Fanny, I have returned, as you requested," said he, on
entering the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am glad to see you. Among all your vows and promises,
there is one I have held as sacred; and when I think of it, my
brain seems on fire!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What is it! You surely need not ask. You know the solemn
vow you made&mdash;you know the sacred promise under which I was
induced to leave my employment, and take up my abode with you in
these apartments!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, you know! You have not forgotten your promise to marry
me!"</p>

<p>Here both parties sat for some moments in silent meditation, when
she resumed:</p>

<p>"George, my mind borders on frenzy, when I think of the home
in the country, of the friends I there had, and the society I there
enjoyed&mdash;when I think of those happy days of innocence, and contrast
them with the guilt, the agony, the despair of my present condition.
O! these agonizing thoughts will drive me mad!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Fanny," said George, very coolly. "I will see
that you are provided for."</p>

<p>"Provided for! That is nothing to the disgrace that will befall me,

<!-- page 40 -->

when my situation shall become known to my friends, unless you
fulfil your vow to make me your wife!"</p>

<p>"Stay! stay your feelings! Fanny, be not desponding! Look on
the bright side!"</p>

<p>"There is no bright side; except you marry me, my prospects are
blighted for ever."</p>

<p>"I will cling to you, and see you through all your troubles."</p>

<p>"You can do nothing for me unless you make me your wife.
That, and that alone, will repair all my wrongs and make me happy
once more."</p>

<p>"You may pass through the whole and your friends know nothing
of it."</p>

<p>"But I shall know it! Yes! and my friends will know it too. But
I will never survive my shame. I will blot out my disgrace with
blood!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Fanny. I can arrange the whole matter so that
you will be comfortable."</p>

<p>"Comfortable! what was I when you first knew me? Was I not comfortable
then? O! when at home in years gone by I was happy! I
had all I could wish. I was innocent and had what I shall never
know again&mdash;peace of mind. O! my mother, how she would feel if
she knew this! It would drive her to madness, as my father was
driven by other woes. O! that I should live to be a curse to her!"
and with these words the poor broken-hearted girl fell to violent
weeping.</p>

<p>At length she resumed her calmness, when George interrupted the
silence by saying:</p>

<p>"You must control your feelings, and listen to some plan by
which we may avoid exposure, and relieve you from your difficulties."</p>

<p>"There are but two modes of relief&mdash;one is marriage, and the
other death! I see the alternative&mdash;nothing is left for me but the
latter!"</p>

<p>"Be not so desperate! There is hope for you. You can be relieved
and become happy again."</p>

<p>"Never! never! What hope is there left for me? Do you intend
to keep your word, and marry me?"</p>

<p>"I know a trusty female physician, who will do for you all you can
desire."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Fanny, starting with indignant
surprise.</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"I mean to place you in the charge of one who will relieve you
from all your difficulties."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the infernal Restell?" asked the girl with trembling
indignation.</p>

<p>"I do!" said George, with unfeeling firmness.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! No. When I wish to rush unprepared and
rashly into the presence of my Maker, this right hand has strength
and courage to do the dreadful deed. I wish no infamous Restell to
dispatch me through the lingering tortures of her diabolical art. I
have the nerve and the heart to do the deed at once."</p>

<p>"You are laboring under a delusion. I cannot reason with you,"
replied George.</p>

<p>"There is no reason in me 'twixt marriage and death. I demand
of you, then, which is my fate!"</p>

<p>"I cannot talk with you until you become calm."</p>

<p>"You have left me trembling on a thread over the abyss of ruin,
and now all you can say is to ask me to be 'calm!' " said the girl,
with a scornful tone, rising from the sofa and walking up and down
the room under deep excitement.</p>

<p>After a few moments silence, she turned toward her betrayer and
said:</p>

<p>"Under a solemn vow of marriage, you led me hither, and have
plunged me deep into misery. I demand of you now, will you fulfil
your promise?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow I will call and see you again."</p>

<p>"No more evasion; I demand an answer this instant. Yes or no."</p>

<p>"I cannot now answer you. I will call again to-morrow, and then
we will settle the question."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is in another world! Thither I will seek it! Another
to-morrow in this world I shall never know!"</p>

<p>George now abruptly took his departure, when Fanny threw herself
on the sofa and gave way to violent tears, which continued until interrupted
by a visit from her cousin, who, herself hardened in guilt, had
seen little of Fanny since the departure of the latter from the work-shop.

Now, having heard of Fanny's situation, she came to visit her, and
being affected by her sad condition, so far relented of the part she had
taken in the affair, as to take an interest in Fanny's welfare, and to
make to her an important disclosure.</p>

<p>She told Fanny that George was a married man, and that he lived
at No. &mdash; Bayard-street.</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>At this announcement Fanny swooned, but soon recovered.</p>

<p>"I advise you," said the cousin, "to go to his house this very night
and make him do something for you. You will find him in at seven
o'clock."</p>

<p>"I will go," said Fanny calmly, "but it is little that I shall want
him to do for me; what I want done I can do for myself."</p>

<p>"If you will go I will accompany you."</p>

<p>"Thanks to you, I will go alone, or you may go with me to the
door, but alone I will enter."</p>

<p>With a sadness too deep for tears, and with a despair beyond the
power of utterance, Fanny carefully arranged her toilet, wrote a short
letter to her mother, and telling her cousin to take charge of her things
if she should not return, took her departure for Bayard-street.</p>

<p>She entered the house alone, saw the wife of him she had called
George, and was satisfied of the reality of the deception that had been
practiced on her.</p>

<p>She then turned aside and took a deep dose of poison she had previously
procured for the purpose, and fell on the sofa in a spasmodic
burst of tears.</p>

<p>When George came in, she rose and cursed him with the frenzy
of a fiend. She was already a maniac. As she was storming with
rage at her betrayer, an irruption of blood burst from her mouth, and
she fell back a corpse.</p>

<p>A coroner's inquest, and an exposure in the newspapers, was the
finale of this sad tragedy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">MOSE IN A MUSS.</p>

</div>

<p>"HURRA, b'hoys!&mdash;look ahead! Now for a muss! Sam, and all
the rest o' yon, be on hand. Don't you see that 'ere short-masted
craft dere&mdash;de sloop a-coming into that dock&mdash;there by Peck Slip?"
said the genuine and original Mose, to a small band of his comrades
off duty and ready for anything.</p>

<p>"Vell, Mose, I does see it&mdash;but vot ov it? Is there any chance for
some lamming to be done?" said Sam, who was a sort of lieutenant
colonel or adjutant general acting under Mose.</p>

<p>"Nothing shorter, d&mdash;n your eyes! Don't you all see there's a
chance for the benefit of Kipp and Brown&mdash;a roaring speculation for
all of us?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n me now, if I can see far enough to see through your speculation
out of that craft. How is it wid you, Charley? Does you
see it wid de guzzling eye-glass?" asked Sam, with a triumphant
chuckle.</p>

<p>"No," muttered Charley, with a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that 'ere tall, lean, long-shanked, sober-looking
chap, with a light green cap on his phrenology-box? He's standing
by the anchor."</p>

<p>"Veil, Mose, I does see a chap yonder, side of dat blubberly long-head
nigger. He's that feller wid his hands in his short breeches
pocket," said Sam, with a grin.</p>

<p>"B'hoys, he's the chap for the benefit! See him now he's ashore,"
said Mose, with a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>"Now for the speculation! What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell yer, b'hoys," said Mose, with his finger to his
nose; "if yer'll back me up well, I'll agree to have a V out of his
pocket in double quick time, If I don't, then never call me Mose
agin."</p>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p>"Well, I'm ready to raise the wind, Mose. You're a good lead&mdash;you
open rich, so d&mdash;n me if I doesn't go into it for the spoils," said
Sam, giving Mose a strong slap on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Here's what opens rich as a box of dry goods," responded Charley,
as he clapped his hands together and strode off several paces.</p>

<p>"Now, croneys, hear to me. You see that green 'un, six
feet in his shoes, squaring off for those lobsters in that old woman's
stand? Say nothing now. I'm into him about a half of ten feet,"
said Mose, with a shout.</p>

<p>"Half of ten dollars you mean, instead of half of ten feet. I'm
right, ain't I?" asked Sam, with a knowing wink.</p>

<p>"I'll gub up that&mdash;you're right," answered Mose.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that you must trust old Divine Providence of yours,"
said Charley.</p>

<p>"Here then, b'hoys, I goes in as a swift witness&mdash;if Divine Providence
permits. I always gets my share&mdash;so here's what's ready,"
ejaculated Sam, with a chuckling tone of joy.</p>

<p>By this time the sloop had made fast to the dock, and the Yankee,
leaping from the deck, had hastily run up to an old woman's stand,
and fallen to devouring the lobsters and other eatables with a keen
appetite.</p>

<p>"Now, Sam, let the feller get through eating, and return to his
sloop, and then, Sam, I'll take you with me, and we'll board her
without ceremony; and Charley, you'll stay here till I send for you,"
said Mose, with the air and tone of a general commander.</p>

<p>Reaching the sloop, they found the Yankee, who had returned from
the stand, near the mast, down upon his knees, greedily devouring
some raw clams, which he had just procured on shore.</p>

<p>"My God! can it be? My friend, stop eating!&mdash;you are in a h&mdash;ll
of a stew!&mdash;in a most dangerous pickle!" exclaimed Mose, in a tone
of alarm.</p>

<p>"Pickle! about what? and who are you?" asked the Yankee, as
he continued eating.</p>

<p>"Stop! hold! and save yourself from destruction! Hold, or you're
a gone coon!"</p>

<p>"You don't think I was brought up in the woods to be scared by
the owls, du you?" drawled the Yankee, with apparent unconcern, as
he continued his eating.</p>

<p>"Let him alone&mdash;let him die in his own way! He seems to be a
nice piece of dry goods, but it's a pity he should spile just now," said
Sam.</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>"What du you mean now? Du just tell!" said the Yankee,
beginning to feel some alarm, and wiping his greasy chops on his
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Sam, shaking his head, with a long sigh; "ah, I'm
sorry for you, but you're a dying man&mdash;that's a fact!"</p>

<p>"He ain't nothing else," said Mose.</p>

<p>"But why?&mdash;what du you mean?&mdash;me a dying man! Why?
Du tell now!" exclaimed the Yankee, getting more alarmed, as he
sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>"Feel of his pulse, Sam, right off quick!" muttered Mose, when
Sam instantly obeyed, while the Yankee stood trembling, white as a
ghost.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's a hard case!" said Sam, in a low, solemn tone, and still
holding on to the pulse.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?&mdash;du tell!" exclaimed the Yankee, now
almost frightened out of his wits.</p>

<p>"Do you know you've been eatin' pisen clams?" asked Mose.</p>

<p>"Pisen clams! O, Lord! send for a doctor! Must I die!&mdash;can't
you save me? O, am I lost? Pisen clams! O, I am gone!&mdash;can't
you save me?" uttered the Yankee, pacing up and down the deck in
a paroxysm of terror.</p>

<p>"Confess your sins," said Mose, "and die like a decent man."</p>

<p>"O, must I die! I have wronged no one&mdash;I hain't injured any man.
I never stole any thing, except water-melons&mdash;and I did steal a sheep
once, but nobody ever knew it! O, dear, shall I die!" exclaimed
the Yankee, so overcome with fear as unconsciously to turn the scene
into a farce.</p>

<p>"Let's lam him&mdash;he's a sheep-stealer!" said Mose, laying his hand
roughly on the Yankee's forehead.</p>

<p>"Lam him!" echoed Sam. "He'd steal the pennies from a dead
man's eyes!"</p>

<p>"O, I'm faint!&mdash;I feel that I am going!&mdash;I'm dying!&mdash;send for a
doctor!" continually exclaimed the poor panic-stricken Yankee.</p>

<p>"Shall I send for a doctor?" asked Mose, with an affectation of
pity.</p>

<p>"Yes, send; for I shall die if you don't, of this pisen clam in my
stomach! O, it is eating me up alive!&mdash;send for the doctor!"</p>

<p>Sam was instantly dispatched for a doctor, while Mose undertook
to comfort the Yankee.</p>

<p>"Why don't the doctor come!&mdash;I feel faint!&mdash;O, my stomach is on
fire!&mdash;I am pisened!"</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>"Sam won't spare shoe-leather in going up there. I'm sure the
doctor will soon be here."</p>

<p>Soon Sam came blustering along, and bringing with him Charley,
who was to enact the character of the doctor.</p>

<p>"Hoo! where's the patient?" asked Charley, blowing and puffing
as though he was almost out of breath.</p>

<p>"Here he is. This way, doctor&mdash;this way, doctor&mdash;he's most
gone!" said Mose, giving Charley a sly wink of the eye.</p>

<p>"Stand back, gentlemen, and give the patient a chance to breathe,
while I examine into the case," said Charley, with a high tone of
authority.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" said Mose, pushing back the small group of persons
that had gathered about the scene.</p>

<p>"My friend, what's the matter?" inquired Charley, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>"O, I'm dying!&mdash;I'm pisened! Doctor, shall I die?" was the
reply of the poor frightened Yankee, who was sitting on the deck with
his hands across his stomach, and actually suffering real pain, as was
natural after having over-eaten of lobsters and clams.</p>

<p>"Doctor, what do you think of his case?" asked Mose, in a doleful
tone.</p>

<p>Charley, feeling the pulse of the Yankee, shook his head, but made
no other reply.</p>

<p>"Give us the verdict, any how!" exclaimed Mose, impatiently.</p>

<p>"It's a doubtful case," said Charley, in a very solemn tone.</p>

<p>"Then is it fixed, doctor, that I can get well? Can't you save me,
doctor?"</p>

<p>"I'll try; but you must keep quiet, and do as I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, I will, doctor," said the Yankee, submissively.</p>

<p>"Bring me quick some warm water," called Charley.</p>

<p>The warm water was instantly brought, and its emetic effects soon
relieved the trembling Yankee of the contents of his overloaded
stomach, and removed the pain he had experienced.</p>

<p>"How do you feel now?" asked Charley, after the water had produced
its full effect and the Yankee seemed entirely relieved from his
pain.</p>

<p>"I feel first rate, doctor. Ain't I cured? I guess all that tarnation
pisen is gone&mdash;ain't it, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are entirely cured; all the pisen is out of you. But if
I hadn't come, you'd a been cold afore this time."</p>

<p>"So I should, doctor. I guess you've saved me! Well, what's to
pay for this job? I 'spose you'll want a five?"</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>"Your life's worth more than that. I can't save a man in such a
case for less than ten."</p>

<p>"Well, here's your cash."</p>

<p>"And now you must pay me and Sam who went for the doctor."
interposed Mose.</p>

<p>This the Yankee paid also, when Mose and his companions moved
off, and wended their way to a grog-shop in Roosevelt-street, where
they divided the spoils. Mose taking ten dollars, and giving the five
to be divided between his followers and dependents, Sam and
Charley.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE OLD BREWERY.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the heart of that centre of all that is degraded, infamous and
wretched&mdash;The Five Points&mdash;stands the "Old Brewery," whose name
indicates the use to which it was formerly applied. It is now an old
and rotten structure, into which are crowded about a hundred of the
most miserable and wretched creatures.</p>

<p>This building is entered by a narrow avenue, known as "Murderer's
Alley," and stands on a sunken spot, surrounded on every side
by shabby and dilapidated tenements, to which the pure air of heaven
seldom or never finds its way. The little open space about the building,
and the narrow alley leading to it, are filthy in the extreme, while
the noxious effluvia naturally arising from the place, is sufficient
to render it remarkable that human beings can exist for any considerable
length of time within reach of such health-destroying
influences.</p>

<p>Under the guide and protection of a police officer, we entered this
abode of misery.</p>

<p>The first group we met was that of a mother and three children, a
boy and two girls. The mother, half covered with filthy rags, bowed
as we approached, while the starving and emaciated young ones looked
up with a sorrowful appeal that must have melted a heart of ice.
Tears the mother and her children would have wept, at the sight of
any one seemingly capable of affording them aid, had not their eyes
been wept dry.</p>

<p>"Mother, have they brought us something to eat?" asked one of
the little girls in piteous tones, as she threw her feeble and uncleansed
arms around her mother's neck.</p>

<p>"My child, I do not know," answered the despairing mother.</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"My dear woman," said the friend who accompanied me, "what
brought you to this distressed condition?"</p>

<p>"It would be a long and sad story to tell," she replied sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"How do you live here? what do you have for food?"</p>

<p>"We have had no food for two days, except what we have gnawed
from those old bones in the corner yonder."</p>

<p>"How long have you been in this place?"</p>

<p>"Since February last&mdash;some three months."</p>

<p>"Have you no friends?"</p>

<p>"I had a husband, and a brother and a sister; but they are all dead
now."</p>

<p>"Then you have had no food these two days except those
bones?"</p>

<p>"No; and the children, poor creatures, gnaw them all the time, as
they are most starved and have nothing else to eat."</p>

<p>"One of them is chewing something now&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is shoe-leather. They want something in their mouths to
chew."</p>

<p>The scene having become now too painful any longer to endure, we
brought forward the basket of cold victuals&mdash;consisting chiefly of meat
and bread&mdash;which we had brought for the occasion.</p>

<p>On seeing this, the children sprang forward with greedy looks, when
the mother seemed overcome, and would have wept had she any tears
to weep.</p>

<p>Before their immediate wants were gratified, we were surrounded
at the door by a group of famishing mortals, old men and women and
children, begging for a morsel of food.</p>

<p>The room we first entered was a small damp apartment on the first
floor, and occupied solely by this widow and her three children. The
floor was covered with a thick damp coating of earth or filth, and the
walls were besmeared with almost every thing repulsive, while the
nauseous vapors and stench of the confined and poisonous atmosphere
would seem sufficient to destroy the vigor and health of the most active
and robust frames.</p>

<p>And such is a fair picture of the apartments throughout this noisome
den, into which are crowded so many wretched and half famished
sufferers.</p>

<p>While our companion was distributing food to the crowd about the
door, we gave a few moments more attention to the poor woman who
had first attracted our attention.</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>She stated that she had been in good circumstances, but her husband,
through intemperance, had brought his family to want, and himself
to an untimely grave, leaving her and three helpless children
without any means of support. She had procured work and kept from
starvation, until now her health was broken, and she had been obliged
to take an apartment in this old den of misery, as she could here pay
her rent for a week or a few days only in advance, and it had taken
all the money she could obtain to pay her rent, small as it was, being
but fifty cents a week.</p>

<p>The appearance of the woman confirmed her statement, for she
seemed to have had a good education.</p>

<p>"I care not for myself," she said, "it is for my children that I
feel. I know that I am broken down, and it matters not now how
soon I am consigned to the grave. I was well brought up, and I
feel it now the more bitterly, to see my children thus reared in
ignorance and degradation. They are bright children, and if they
could only have good homes and education, I would be willing to
leave this world, where nothing is left for me but suffering and
sorrow."</p>

<p>"But have you no friends to look after you?" inquired we.</p>

<p>"When did you ever know the wretched to have any friends? I
have had those whom the world calls friends, and they are now well
off; but I would not have them know my situation."</p>

<p>"Your health is poor&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p>"I am not able to go out to obtain work, nor could I do anything if
I had work to do. The last money I had was obtained by pawning
the last piece of clothing I had left, and I am too proud to beg or to go
to the alms-house."</p>

<p>We promised to call and see her again, and afterward had the satisfaction
of obtaining relief for her wants, through the Association for
the Relief of the Destitute, by which, and also by the aid of some of
her former friends, whose attention we had called to her condition, she
was removed to a comfortable dwelling, and her children placed in
situations where they earned their own living.</p>

<p>We entered next a larger room, occupied by several families. We
first saw an old man sitting on a stool, rubbing his hands, his chin in
active motion, and his emaciated form trembling like the last leaf in
autumn.</p>

<p>At the sight of us, he lifted himself with difficulty on his bare feet,
and half covered with rags, came forward with a blessing, and with
tears in his eyes, begged for food.</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>At the same instant, the glaring eyes, the sunken features, and
wan, starving countenances of women and children, gathered around
our basket, crying most piteously for something to eat. Not one but
was clad in rags, and seemed the very personification of wretchedness
and misery.</p>

<p>We distributed a small quantity of food among them and went on
our way, but several followed us, crying for more, which we were
compelled to refuse, in order to save something if possible for all of the
more needy whom we might meet.</p>

<p>Another old man we found, who was but a mere skeleton. We
gave him some bread, which he swallowed with great greediness, and
then thanked us with a smile, saying he had not had a morsel of food
for nearly two days.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms sat a poor woman clothed in filthy rags, who
was unable to walk. We found her weeping.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep?" asked my friend. "Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Look yonder!" said she. "There is my daughter, and you will
not wonder why I weep!"</p>

<p>We looked as she pointed with her finger, and we beheld,
partly concealed behind an old barrel in the hall, a young girl, of
not more than twenty, apparently in a frenzied state, lying on
the floor, and sucking the blood from her own arm, which she had
bitten.</p>

<p>"Stop, my child!" said we, "why do you suck the blood from your
own arm?"</p>

<p>"There is no other food for me!" cried she, in the most frantic
agony.</p>

<p>"Here is food for you," said we, offering her bread and meat,
which she devoured most ravenously. She thanked us, and then we
went on.</p>

<p>Such are the scenes which are to be met with daily in the "Old
Brewery."</p>

<p>Yet, is it not strange that in a city abounding in wealth&mdash;where
thousands live in luxuries they do not want and cannot enjoy, and
are puzzled to devise means to get rid of their money, that such
misery and wretchedness should be suffered to exist?</p>

<p>Instead of throwing away hundreds on some useless toy not cared
for, or some pernicious indulgence, why is it that the rich will not
spare a few dollars to relieve the sufferings of the destitute and the
dying?</p>

<p>This is the great question society has been asking for the past

<!-- page 52 -->

five thousand years, and it now seems as far off from a solution as
ever.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, a melancholy fact, that man cares not for his
brother man, and the contrast in the condition of the rich and the poor
in our large cities exhibits the selfishness and depravity of the human
heart, in a light that is melancholy and lamentable to behold.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">A WIFE WITH TWO HUSBANDS; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN.</p>

</div>

<p>"BY heavens! what a beautiful creature!" exclaimed Charles
C&mdash;&mdash;p, a clerk with Charles O'Conner, as a young and beautiful
woman left the office, after having been in consultation with the distinguished
bachelor counsellor.</p>

<p>"O! she's angelic! she's divine!" replied George, a fellow clerk.
"I wonder who she is. Egad, if she couldn't melt O'Conner's stoical
indifference, it must be something colder than ice!"</p>

<p>"She had such a sweet countenance&mdash;such an intelligent expression!
She is indeed divine! George, I'm in love with that woman.
I will, I must have her. Ask O'Conner who she is, won't you?"</p>

<p>"No; I'll leave that to you. Perhaps he might tell me to mind my
business."</p>

<p>"Egad, I'll find out!" exclaimed Charles, jumping from his chair
in great excitement.</p>

<p>The mystery, was, however, soon explained, when papers were
handed to the clerks to copy, touching the application for divorce in
the case of Mary C&mdash;&mdash;k <i>vs.</i> James C&mdash;&mdash;k.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! Charley! Here the mystery is solved! This beautiful
creature is a married woman," said George.</p>

<p>"A married woman? It can't be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's married; but never mind that, here's her affidavit for
a divorce, and it reads rich."</p>

<p>"A divorce? She shall have it, and that's not all, I'll help her to
another husband instanter. Has she any children?"</p>

<p>"One little girl."</p>

<p>"It does not seem possible; I should not take her to be over sixteen
or seventeen."</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>The truth was, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;k was scarcely eighteen, though she had
been married more than two years.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of a wealthy butcher, residing in the upper
part of the Bowery. While a school girl, she had attracted the
attention of a dashing looking young man, with whom she had fallen
in love.</p>

<p>Of his situation she and her parents knew but little, though her
father had become satisfied he was a gambler. He claimed to be in
possession of a considerable fortune, and he found little difficulty in
persuading the young lady to believe whatever he might desire.</p>

<p>The result of the affair was this: he was forbidden to enter the
house&mdash;the young lady protested and was imprisoned in her chamber.
Nevertheless she found means of communicating with her lover, and he
contrived means for her escape.</p>

<p>A ladder was provided. At midnight she opens her window,
descends the ladder; a carriage is waiting; she enters, and in the arms
of a lover is borne to the house of a friend, where they are married.</p>

<p>Afterward a reconciliation with her parents is effected, and she
returns home with her husband to reside.</p>

<p>The illusion did not last long. Soon she discovered that her husband
was a professional gambler, and that instead of a fortune, he had
only the uncertain returns of the gaming-house to depend on. Hence
he was sometimes profuse and prodigal, and at other times entirely
destitute.</p>

<p>After the lapse of more than two years, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;k applied,
through Mr. O'Conner, for a divorce, which, after a short delay, she
obtained without opposition.</p>

<p>During the proceedings in this case, Charles C&mdash;&mdash;p, one of Mr.
O'Conner's clerks, became desperately enamored of the fair applicant,
and before unloosing herself from the first tie, she had already consented
to bind herself by a second one.</p>

<p>Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;k was a woman of rare beauty. Tall and graceful in
her form, she would have formed a perfect model for an artist. But
her chief attraction lay in her countenance. Her face was symmetrically
beautiful, and cast in the expression of the most divine loveliness.
She was a woman that would cause a stranger, in her presence, involuntarily
to pause and admire&mdash;even to love her&mdash;for the sweetness and
loveliness of her disposition, as expressed through a countenance of
unsurpassed beauty, was perfectly captivating.</p>

<p>Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;p had then fallen in love with her at first sight, and was
resolved she should become his own.</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>Being of an agreeable person, with a fluent and ready wit, he found
no difficulty in obtaining entrance to the temple of her affections, where
he paid the most devout worship.</p>

<p>Having been unfortunate in her first marriage, she had repined over
her miserable condition, and had sighed to partake of the domestic
bliss which her more fortunate acquaintances seemed to enjoy.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;p paid his addresses to her, she thought
now an opportunity was afforded her of entering anew the marriage
state, and enjoying those blessings of peace and love which she had
so long sighed after in vain.</p>

<p>Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;k, as was stated, obtained her divorce; but she was compelled
to give up her only child, a beautiful girl. The sacrifice was
great, but she thought amid new ties and new scenes, she should become
reconciled to the absence of her daughter, and, if not forgetting
her, at least cease to dwell upon her with regret.</p>

<p>In a few short months, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;k had become Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p, and
was settled with her husband in his native village in the interior of
the State.</p>

<p>There her time for a short period passed pleasantly away, but soon
she found that living the life of a village lawyer's wife would not satisfy
her.</p>

<p>She had spirit and ambition that could find no sphere for action in
the circle in which she moved. Gay and fond of society, she now
pined under the monotony of a sedate country life, and longed for the
exciting scenes of city life, of which she had in the years of her girlhood
tasted sufficiently to acquire a fondness for, and from which she
had been cut off before her desires had been subdued to moderation, by
a reasonable and proper indulgence in the amusements of society.</p>

<p>She therefore felt like a young girl, snatched prematurely from a
scene of pleasure, and though still in sight of the object of her desire,
yet withheld from all participation therein.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the youthful Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p sighed in secret
for scenes she felt she was destined never to behold. Still, like a
good wife, she strove to hide her feelings and wear a cheerful countenance
on all occasions.</p>

<p>Her beauty, her youth, her wit, her keen susceptibilities for social
enjoyments&mdash;all these she beheld withering in the desert sun of her
isolation, and not a sympathising breeze passed by to receive the perfume
of her gentle but unuttered repinings.</p>

<p>It would have been some relief to her desolate heart, had there been
young buds of promise shooting from the parent stem. But to her

<!-- page 58 -->

the rich gift of children was now denied, and the more her thoughts
wandered back to the darling child she had left behind and given up
as she believed for ever, the more the love of her absent child
became the absorbing passion of her soul.</p>

<p>After having lived this quiet life for four years, she at length, after
much persuasion, obtained the consent of her husband to visit her
friends in New York.</p>

<p>A mother she had not had since a child, but her father was still
living, and married a second time. Brothers she had in the city, to
whom she was tenderly attached, and there dwelt her twin sister&mdash;her
other self, whom she loved as she loved her own soul. But, above all,
there, too, was her child, whom she had not now seen for four years,
and whom she felt that she now loved more than she loved her own life.
The preparation is made&mdash;the journey undertaken; she is with her
husband once more in her father's house. Her child&mdash;where was
that? It was at a boarding-school in Bond, street, under the protection
of its father, and was now a beautiful young girl about six years old.
Hither she ran the first day without the knowledge of her husband,
obtained admittance, and beheld once more the object of her tenderest
love. Almost frenzied with excitement, she strained her daughter to
her bosom, and parted from her again with tears, as though her heart
would break.</p>

<p>Daily she was permitted to visit the child, but while at her father's
house she was in a melancholy mood, and most of the time wandering
alone in the garden.</p>

<p>One day, when visiting her child, she was struck by surprise at
the entrance of her former husband, the father of her daughter&mdash;Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;k.</p>

<p>"I am most glad to see you!" he exclaimed. "You are the only
woman I ever did or ever shall love!"</p>

<p>"This, sir, is strange. What means it? I was told that no one, and
especially you, should intrude on me in these visits to my child,"
said the woman, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I did not wish to intrude on these your sacred interviews
with our child; but the memory of the happy days I have
known in your society, and the love that still clings to my heart, have
impelled me to break in upon this scene, and, even at the risk of incurring
your anger, to speak once more to the only woman I ever
loved."</p>

<p>"You know my situation and the impropriety of this proceeding.
You or I must immediately depart."</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p>"Be not so rash. You respected and reciprocated my passion in
former days&mdash;why so rudely rebuff it now?"</p>

<p>"You know my altered situation, and what my present position
requires."</p>

<p>"Love knows no law but its own will, and it will have its way."</p>

<p>"Sir, I must leave!" And with these words, she started to leave
the room, when he interrupted her, by saying:</p>

<p>"Do you want your child?"</p>

<p>"My child? It is all I want!"</p>

<p>"You can have her."</p>

<p>"O, my child! my child!" she exclaimed, embracing her daughter
with tears of joy.</p>

<p>"But there is one condition on which alone you can ever possess
her again."</p>

<p>"What is the condition&mdash;name it?"</p>

<p>"You must do justice to me!"</p>

<p>"Justice to you! When did I ever do you injustice?"</p>

<p>"You separated from me&mdash;abandoned me for another!"</p>

<p>"I was divided from you according to law, and was afterward married
to a man whom I never saw until after I had applied for my bill.
Do you call this abandoning you for another? Did I not have cause
for the course I pursued?"</p>

<p>"I will not speak of that now. You did not hear what I had to say
in my own defense. But you were instigated to the course you pursued
by your friends."</p>

<p>"Consider I had cause. Your unfaithfulness and the profession
you pursued&mdash;were they not a sufficient cause?"</p>

<p>"We'll not speak of that now. Had you heard me at the time, I
could have explained every thing to your satisfaction."</p>

<p>"If I've wronged you, it's too late now to repair that wrong."</p>

<p>"But you have never heard me. How know you but you would
have been satisfied had you heard me? Listen to me now, and then
judge."</p>

<p>"If it be in my power to repair any wrong I may have done, I will
cheerfully do it. But now I must be gone."</p>

<p>"Another time, and you will hear me?"</p>

<p>"Another time!' said she, leaving the room, and returning directly
to her father's house.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE WOMAN WITH TWO HUSBANDS, CONCLUDED.</p>

</div>

<p>MRS. C&mdash;&mdash;p, on returning home, passed the remainder of the day
in profound melancholy. Her thoughts were upon her daughter, and
now a hope had been held out to her, yet burdened with a condition
that seemed impossible for her to fulfil.</p>

<p>But she could not forget her daughter. The gleam of hope that
had once shot across her mind, still faintly glimmered in the distance.
At one moment, she resolved to make the sacrifice, whatever it might
be, in order to possess the dearest object of her love. At another,
this seemed impracticable, and she was then plunged into the deepest
despair.</p>

<p>Now reminiscences of her first love arose in her heart, and the
reflection that she might have done injustice to him whom she once
tenderly cherished, preyed upon her. She then at length resolved
that if he should present himself before her on the following day on
her visit to her child, she would hear him, and at all hazards would
recover possession of her daughter.</p>

<p>The morrow came, and at her usual hour repaired to the school.
Here, as was anticipated, she met her former husband.</p>

<p>He told her his story, and his words fell on listening and sympathizing
ears. He admitted his guilt, but related palliating circumstances
that if known at the time, would have induced her to forgive
him.</p>

<p>As to his profession of gambling, he had only temporarily pursued
it from necessity, and then only after his marriage, and for the sake of
procuring a respectable and genteel living for her.</p>

<p>Born to wealth, and educated in luxury, he had in a dissipated
mood provoked his father to abandon him; and the gaming table,
which had subsequently afforded him occasional relief, he had, after

<!-- page 61 -->

his marriage, been compelled to make his constant resort as a sole
dependence for himself and family.</p>

<p>But he had long since reformed, and had been reconciled to his
father, whose recent death had now left him in possession of a large
fortune.</p>

<p>He contended that her divorce and subsequent marriage were both
invalid, and he was not served with a legal notice in the case of
her proceedings against him, and that he might now lawfully claim
her as his wife.</p>

<p>He professed the same ardent attachment to her as ever, and conjured
her for her own and his future peace and happiness to abandon
the man to whom she was not legally married, and to return to the
only one whom she had ever truly loved, and with whom alone she
could live happily.</p>

<p>He painted in vivid colors the enjoyments and pleasures which his
wealth and a city life would procure, and the true bliss she would
find in the society of her child, and a husband she loved, and with
opportunities of daily intercourse with her twin-sister and other
friends.</p>

<p>These words produced a deep impression on the susceptible mind
of this young and sorrow-stricken woman. She thought of the dismal,
tedious hours she would be doomed to pass in solitude, or what is
worse, in the midst of uncongenial society, and that too, with a husband
whom she now looked on with aversion; and then after having
renewed her attachment to her daughter, to be separated for ever&mdash;the
thought was agonizing, and she had not the strength to endure it.</p>

<p>If she yielded she would have her daughter again&mdash;she would be
surrounded by the charms and excitements of a life of pleasure and
enjoyment, and would also exchange the society of a man whom she
never loved, for one whom she had always regarded with fondness,
and from whom she separated only under the momentary passion of
resentment for her neglected and injured beauty.</p>

<p>These considerations agitated her bosom with tumultuous emotions,
and convulsed with tears, she said:</p>

<p>"I yield on one condition."</p>

<p>"What is it? Name it," he returned with eager impatience.</p>

<p>"It is this, I must see my elder brother and my sister, and if they
consent, I consent."</p>

<p>"Be it so; I will abide their decision. To-morrow let us meet
again that I may know my fate."</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will meet again."</p>

<!-- page 62 -->

<p>On this the parties separated, when Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p immediately repaired
to her twin-sister, who was married and in good circumstances,
residing in the upper part of the city.</p>

<p>To her she told the whole story of her sufferings, and readily obtained
her consent to abandon the last husband, and by all means to
recover the child. The brother was called and his consent was also
obtained.</p>

<p>The next day, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p and her first husband again met and arranged
their plans, which were to be put immediately into execution.</p>

<p>Evening came, and in her father's house Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p was quite
cheerful.</p>

<p>Her husband, who observed this change in her feelings, was himself
also in the best spirits, and previous to his going out to spend the
evening, had bestowed on her the tenderest caresses. Ah! little did
he know that he was looking on that lovely countenance for the last
time; little did he know that he was pressing those lips to his own for
the last time.</p>

<p>Soon after he had gone, a carriage drove up near the residence
of Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p's father, the door was thrown open,
but no one egressed. It had not long been waiting when Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;p, throwing on her bonnet, slid unperceived out of her father's
house, and entered this carriage, which then drove off.</p>

<p>She was not missed until about ten o'clock, when her husband
returned. Search was instantly made, messengers were dispatched
to the school, to her brother's, and to her sister's, but no tidings
of her. could be obtained. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;p became alarmed lest some
accident had befallen her, and was pacing up and down the hall
in great agitation, when a ring was heard at the door bell. He
opened the door in great haste, hoping to meet his missing wife, but
great was his disappointment on receiving from a boy the following
note:</p>

<p>MY ONCE DEAR HUSBAND:</p>

<p>The change which has come over my feelings renders it impossible
for me any longer to live with you. This will explain the cause
of my departure. I am now gone where you can never see me more.
I trust that you may bear the misfortune as becomes a man, and that
you will hereafter have no cause to regret the step I have taken.
You have lost one who can no longer love you, but who now by this
act gives you an opportunity to become happy with another. My best
wishes for your prosperity and happiness go with you.</p>

<p>Farewell, MARY C&mdash;&mdash;p.</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>On reading this, the afflicted man fainted, but on reviving, recovered
a manly composure, and bore the mortification and regret he must
naturally have felt with a composed and resigned mind. Her parents,
who were taken by surprise at this singular conduct, were indignant
at their daughter, and made every effort to find out her place of concealment,
in order if possible to restore her to her husband, with whom
they sincerely sympathized.</p>

<p>He, on the contrary, desired no effort should be made to restore her
to him, as he was resolved to return immediately home, send back the
furniture and clothes belonging to her, and never think of her more.</p>

<p>With this resolution he returned home, and as he had promised,
restored to his late wife all that had belonged to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;p had, on the night of her elopement, entered the carriage
in waiting for her, where she was received in the arms of Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;k, her first husband, and was conveyed immediately to her
brother's house, where with her daughter, she remained concealed
from her parents and friends for some weeks.</p>

<p>Afterward she had a house of her own, furnished in elegant style,
with horses and carriages at her command, and soon she became
involved in a whirl of dissipation and amusement.</p>

<p>Her first husband was restored to her love, and they seem to pass
their time as happily as when first married. She takes the name of
her first husband, and few knew any thing of her previous adventures.</p>

<p>But among all her friends and acquaintances she is beloved for her
beauty, her agreeable manners, her lively and entertaining wit, and
also for her numerous virtues, which shine conspicuous through the
tenor of her life.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">SCENES AND ACTIONS IN THE SOCIETY OF MORAL REFORM.</p>

</div>

<p>A TALL, young and beautiful woman, known by the cognomen of
Mrs. (we will not give her real name, but call it) Shampill, was a
leading actor in the Moral Reform movements of this city.</p>

<p>Her history may be thus briefly summed up: She and two sisters
were early left orphans, and dependent on their own exertions for
bread&mdash;she learned the trade of milliner. The eldest was soon married,
and after having borne two children, was left a widow. The
next younger sister died about the same time. Thus the widow and
the youngest sister&mdash;the latter but eighteen&mdash;found themselves alone
in the world.</p>

<p>They took a house together, and let rooms to lodgers, but it was not
long before the busy tongue of scandal had filled the air with rumors,
false or true. The youngest, to counteract the effect of these tales,
consented to marry a miserable old invalid, who belonged to a family
of some distinction, but whose fortune was now reduced to a few
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>With this small sum a larger house was taken, and furnished in
good style, and the name of Dr. Shampill put on the door, as the old
man had been a doctor, though without practice. In this new
establishment they lived; but what they gained in money they lost in
reputation.</p>

<p>The house was made the scene of gayety and dissipation. Frequently
they gave supper parties. On such occasions, at about nine
o'clock, a party of young gentlemen and young ladies would be
gathered, and love and song, and mirth and pleasure, would go round
till past the keystone hour of the night.</p>

<p>To speak of the character of the ladies assembled, or to describe
more particularly the scenes enacted on these occasions, is foreign to
the purposes of this work. It is sufficient to say that Mrs. Dr. Shampill

<!-- page 65 -->

became an object of much admiration within a certain circle of
young men, and frequently rode out, or walked with some of the
dashing young men that frequented her house, while, in her own house,
she was conspicuous in the merry-making parties, which boded no
good to her fame.</p>

<p>Days passed on, and Mrs. Dr. Shampill and her sister quarreled,
and separated. The former took a new house, letting the rooms to
lodgers, joined the church and entered the business of moral reform.</p>

<p>Another actor in these scenes was also the wife of a doctor. She
was the victim of a mother's folly.</p>

<p>In a town in the northern part of this State she was born and
educated. Her mother, who became romantically attached to a
female-friend, had at a boarding school joined in a mutual vow that
their future children should be united in matrimony. It so happened
that this mother married rich, and her friend comparatively poor, and
the only son of the latter was ten years older than the only daughter
of the former.</p>

<p>This mother, when her daughter was but fifteen, was brought upon
her death bed, during the absence of her husband at the South. At
this solemn juncture, her female friend came forward and insisted on
the marriage of their children, lest, after her death, it might be prevented.
She wished, at all events, to secure a rich bride for
her son.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony was privately performed, and, as previously
agreed upon, the parties immediately separated, not to re-unite or
make their marriage known to friends or the public for two years.</p>

<p>Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;t, which was the name of the bridegroom, returned to his
studies in the medical college, and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;t, after her mother's
death, was sent to a boarding-school.</p>

<p>After the stipulated lapse of time, the victims of this foolish marriage
returned to their native place, and were publicly married over again.
Of course it took but a short time for them to discover that they were
mutually unfitted for each other's society, and that a mutual aversion
existed between them.</p>

<p>Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;t was but seventeen, beautiful, accomplished, and fond
of gayety. The susceptibilities of her private nature, and the
inclinations of her mind, easily lead her from her plodding, ungainly
and phlegmatic husband into censurable flirtations with the gay and
designing admirers in whose society she found more congenial sympathies.</p>

<p>Disgraced at home, her father denounced and cast her off, when

<!-- page 66 -->

she and her husband came to the City of New York to seek their fortunes.
After various struggles and trials, through which he was
supported by his wife, he at length commenced business as a hom&oelig;opathic
physician.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t, who had hitherto spent several weeks, or months,
every winter at the South, in the company of an uncle or a cousin,
and who had flirted herself out of all respectable society at Saratoga
Springs, and had, in one instance, been requested to leave the United
States Hotel&mdash;now settled down in her own house in this city, and had
things in her own way.</p>

<p>If the doctor's business was not very lucrative at first, the house
nevertheless thrived&mdash;furniture, and dress, and gay company, and
money, were not wanting to make time pass pleasantly away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t now became a leader in the moral reform movement.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous actor was an old deformed woman, a widow,
who had been a milliner all her days, and having in her old age joined
the church, set up for the character of a benevolent woman.</p>

<p>She united herself with every religious or charitable society, where
she could get admitted, and finding her former occupation was looked
on as rather vulgar by the professors of religion and charity, contrived,
by the aid of a poor music-teacher and an old piano, to set up the
double business of a select boarding-school and a boarding-house for a
"few families" or "single gentlemen."</p>

<p>If she would every week have a day or two to herself, when she
would lie in her dining-room stretched on a settee in a state of stupor,
which the uncharitable called drunkenness, it was not her fault, but
that of her ill-health, which required the free use of brandy, as prescribed
by her physician, who was, and is, a well-known temperance
lecturer.</p>

<p>If her boarders would frequently refuse to eat what was set before
them, it was not her fault, for she always bought the <i>cheapest</i> the
market afforded.</p>

<p>If the daughter would charge the mother with lying and drunkenness,
it was not the fault of the parent, for she had often told the child
not to do so, as it would be a scandal to her who belonged to so many
religious and temperance societies, and who stood so high in the
church.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cain, for that was the pious old lady's name, had often been
charged with not paying any of her servants, but this charge was
false, for she did at least pay one as follows:</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>A meeting of one of the charitable associations to which she
belonged met at her house to distribute clothing to the poor.</p>

<p>"I have sent," said Mrs. Cain, "for a very poor widow woman,
with small children, to come and get some clothing to-day."</p>

<p>"Let her be brought in," said the Presidentess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cain went out and soon returned with her own servant, whom
she had instructed to play her part.</p>

<p>The servant received the clothing, and Mrs. Cain afterward charged
twice its value in payment of her wages.</p>

<p>Such were three of the most conspicuous actors in the Moral Reform
Society of the City of New York.</p>

<p>Let us attend an informal meeting of these immaculate moral
reformers.</p>

<p>It is called at Sister Cain's. A few only are notified to attend.
The business is looking after suspected delinquents, either the husbands
or lovers of the female moral reformers.</p>

<p>The presidentess, a busy old maid, and the treasurer, a simple-minded
and pious matron, whose husband never troubled himself about
her affairs, were present. Mrs. Dr. Shampill, Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t, and
Mrs. Milliner, school-mistress, boarding-house-keeper-Cain, together
with a couple of young married ladies, formed the remainder of the
members of the meeting, with two exceptions&mdash;these were the clairvoyant
operator, styled Dr. Ashwood, and his subject, Eliza.</p>

<p>The members present were believers in the occult science and
mysteries of clairvoyance. The disbelievers were not notified to
attend.</p>

<p>The presidentess called the meeting to order.</p>

<p>Prayer by Sister Cain.</p>

<p>Next came the order of the day.</p>

<p>Sister Cain rose and said that "Mrs. Wood was present, and though
she had not yet been married one year, she was thrown into the
greatest distress of mind at the recent neglect of her husband, and his
absence from home to a very late hour at night. I move that the
clairvoyant be put upon him, that we may find him out and reform
him."</p>

<p>"I second the motion," says Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t.</p>

<p>"The vote is unanimous," announced the presidentess.</p>

<p>The operator puts his subject in motion.</p>

<p>"There he goes!" exclaims the clairvoyant, Eliza. "There he
goes&mdash;see&mdash;trace him into that elegant house near the Parade Ground.
It is ten o'clock."</p>

<!-- page 68 -->

<p>"Who lives there?" asked the operator.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. Shampill turns pale, moves in her seat, and puts her handkerchief
to her mouth.</p>

<p>"It is a doctor," answers Eliza. "See, he approaches that beautiful
woman. She smiles&mdash;the gentleman smiles."</p>

<p>"Well, what else do you see?"</p>

<p>"He sits down by her side."</p>

<p>"Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"A little rosy-cheeked boy with arrows hovers over them, and in a
few minutes they are enveloped in a misty shower of gold."</p>

<p>"Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"All looks bright and luminous; but I can see nothing more."</p>

<p>"Who is this lady?"</p>

<p>"The doctor's wife."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>"You will see the name on the door-plate. It begins with S."</p>

<p>"This is a dubious case," said Mrs. Cain.</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned to Mrs. Dr. Shampill, for all could have
no doubt that it was her that was meant.</p>

<p>"Please ask the clairvoyant what night this was?" said Mrs. Dr.
Shampill, in a bold tone.</p>

<p>"What night was this?"</p>

<p>"It was last Friday night."</p>

<p>"Do you not remember," asked Mrs. Dr. Shampill, turning toward
the treasurer, "that on last Saturday morning I handed you a donation
from a friend, of a two dollar and a half gold piece?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," replied the treasurer.</p>

<p>"Now I can tell you how it was," explained Mrs. Dr. Shampill.
"The doctor was standing at the door and saw Mr. Wood passing,
and he called him in. I philop&oelig;ned Mr. Wood, and he gave a small
donation to the society, which money I handed the next morning to
the treasurer, and this is the golden shower Eliza saw."</p>

<p>"This explanation seems entirely satisfactory," said Mrs. Dr.
B&mdash;&mdash;t.</p>

<p>"I think so too," said the treasurer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wood expressed herself satisfied with the explanation; when
the examination proceeded in regard to a young man, a clerk in
Broad-street, whose conduct Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t wished scrutinized, as
she pretended, for the sake of a cousin of hers, a young lady to whom
the young gentleman in question was engaged to be married.</p>

<p>The real truth was, this young gentleman was a fond and too

<!-- page 69 -->

familiar friend of Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t, and she had lately suspected him
of certain vagaries which did not over-please her.</p>

<p>The examination proceeded, but nothing definite was elicited, save
a visit or two to some young ladies, whom, perhaps, he ought not to
have visited.</p>

<p>The other young married lady had her husband's conduct put under
the clairvoyant sight, but nothing of moment was elicited, save that he
was fond of calling on Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t, and had been seen riding out
with Mrs. Dr. Shampill. But these circumstances were satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p>The clairvoyants were dismissed with a fee of fifteen dollars, five of
which went privately in the pocket of Sister Cain, who had procured
for him the job of regularly attending these meetings.</p>

<p>At the regular meetings of the society, the treasurer accounted for
these expenses under the head of miscellanies, and would never give
any more particular account of the money. To replenish the treasury,
the country auxiliary societies were loudly called on to aid in the
cause of female virtue, and the rich and benevolent in the city were
frequently importuned to contribute.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;t met her friend in the evening, and charged him
with what had been revealed by the clairvoyant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. Shampill returned home and took off her plain black dress
in which she always appeared at the society, at church and on other
similar occasions.</p>

<p>She now arrayed herself in gay and dashing colors and bedecked
with jewelry. Her husband, as he was styled, was in the basement,
where he was usually kept, when a well-dressed young gentleman
called.</p>

<p>A short time afterward, Mrs. Dr. Shampill and Mr. Wood were
seen riding out on the Bloomingdale Road, and seemingly in the
highest glee.</p>

<p>Thus goes the world, and of such stuff are made half the pretended
reformers of the world.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">A SCENE IN DUANE-STREET.</p>

</div>

<p>WE here present another chapter of the Iniquities of New York,
in which is pictured forth a deplorable state of morals.</p>

<p>The scenes here depicted&mdash;unfortunately of too common occurrence&mdash;confirm
the statements of some of the most experienced police
officers, who affirm that two-thirds of the support given to the houses
of ill-fame, in this city, comes from married men.</p>

<p>Some of the parties involved in the following occurrence occupy
distinguished positions in society, and the degradation to which they
have stooped, only renders the more conspicuous and more dangerous
the flagrant vices to which they have been addicted.</p>

<p>The pen of the moralist and the tongue of the reformer are called
on for a more bold and active exercise of their benevolence in the work
of wiping out from the face of society the foul stains of licentiousness
and debauchery.</p>

<p>As the Spartans exhibited drunken helots before their children, to
incite in their minds an abhorrence of the drunkenness, so we here
present to the world the following picture of sin and depravity, copied
from the columns of the Police Gazette, in order that this rock of
temptation and death may be shunned:</p>

<p>A rich and racy scene occurred at the Court of Special Sessions on
Friday last. On that occasion, a pretty and fashionably attired young
girl, named Caroline M&mdash;&mdash;, was placed on trial, charged with having
violently assaulted Mrs. Jane W&mdash;&mdash;, keeper of a house of prostitution,
No. &mdash; Duane-street.</p>

<p>Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, who presents an antiquated appearance of forty odd
years gathering, appeared in court, most flauntingly attired in silks
and furbelows, while the early hour at which she had risen, caused
such haste in her toilet, as to leave the recent traces of paint and

<!-- page 71 -->

powder streaming down her face, like a muddy brook rushing through
a chalk pit. She was attended by several of her "boarders," while,
on the other hand, the fair prisoner was escorted into court by a crowd
of tawdry-dressed associates, intermingled with her "talented and
ingenious" attorney at law.</p>

<p>Jane W&mdash;&mdash; being examined, testified that the prisoner was a
boarder in her establishment for the last three months. On the
morning of the 12th of July, about half-past 10 o'clock, her attention
was attracted by the servant girl Maria, who complained that Caroline
was making a muss on the table cloth, by spilling the coffee and
breaking the cups and saucers. Witness went down stairs for the
purpose of expostulation with her, when the latter insisted on having
hot coffee for breakfast, as she paid seven dollars a week for her
board. The servant told her that if she would come to breakfast
early, instead of walking down stairs at half past ten, she could get
her coffee always hot. Witness endeavored to remove Caroline from
the room, when she smashed cups, saucers, china, glass, ornaments,
and every thing else she could lay her hands on, and on witness
attempting to prevent her, she flew at her like a tigress&mdash;tore
her clothes, grappled her by the throat and would have choked
her to death, but for the interference of Dr. Fall, who came to
her rescue.</p>

<p><i>Counsel for defense</i>.&mdash;What sort of house do you keep, and where
do you keep it?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. I keep a boarding house at &mdash; Duane-street.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. Are they all girl boarders?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. Well, I guess so.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. Do you know Mr. J. A&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. Yes, very well.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. Does he or Dr. Fall board there? (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. No, sir, they don't.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. Did you or either of those gentlemen shake this prisoner
before she attacked you?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. No, sir, they didn't do no such thing.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. What does this girl pay for her board per week?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. $7 per week.</p>

<p><i>Counsel</i>. Besides bed money? (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>, (<i>with much impertinent indignation</i>.) Bed money! What's
bed money, sir? I don't know what you mean, sir! Bed money!
I never receive bed money, sir. (<i>Great laughter among the audience,
and the police and Prince John Davis' finger to his nose</i>.)</p>

<!-- page 72 -->

<p>Joe A&mdash;&mdash; was here called as a witness in behalf of Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;,
but he did not answer.</p>

<p>Dr. Adolph Fall was next called to the stand, amid a fluttering
excitement from the audience, who appeared to expect some rich
developments from the professional attendant of a house so well known
for disease and for every creeping thing.</p>

<p>The doctor stated that, at about half-past ten o'clock, on the morning
in question, while he was attending a patient in the house opposite that
kept by Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, a girl called to him from the attic window, and
said that Caroline was murdering Miss Jane, down stairs, and begged
him to come over right away and separate them, as she had her down
on the floor belting her among the broken crockery; that he ran
directly across into the basement, and found Caroline bearing Miss
Jane with one hand and choking her with the other; that he attempted
to part them, but had much difficulty before he succeeded, and afterward
had to send for a policeman to take Caroline away to the Tombs.</p>

<p><i>Cross-examined by defense</i>. What is your business, sir, and where
do you reside?</p>

<p><i>Witness</i>. I am a physician, and my residence is at &mdash; Warren-street.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Do you often visit this house, doctor?</p>

<p><i>A</i>, (<i>much excited</i>.) I have a right to attend the house as often as I
please, professionally, sir; I have answered the question, and I don't
wish to be asked any impertinent questions beyond it.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Many of the inmates of the house are continually diseased, are
they not, doctor, and this makes it necessary for you to call often, I
suppose?</p>

<p><i>A</i>. They're like other girls, I suppose&mdash;sick and well, as circumstances
happen. (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. You appear to know them all well, doctor, you speak and nod
to them familiarly, as I saw just now.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. No, sir, I don't know them more than other persons whose
business brings them there professionally. (<i>Much smirking among the
policemen present at the latitude of the word "professionally."</i>)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Your professional license gives you great latitude, doesn't it,
doctor, in all matters appertaining to female diseases? (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. Of course it does&mdash;it's my business.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Have you ever seen a model artiste at Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;'s for medical
inspection? (<i>Roars of Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. I shall answer no question not relative to the case. (<i>More
roars</i>.)</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p><i>Q</i>. Well, doctor, answer me this. Did you ever see any thing at
Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;'s that looked like a live corpse? (<i>Shouts of laughter,
with cries of order, order</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. I appeal to the court for protection&mdash;I sha'n't answer such
questions. (<i>More snorting</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Doctor, never mind about that answer. But did you ever see
Joe A&mdash;&mdash; at the house of Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The doctor objected to answering the question and it was ruled out
by the court.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. While you were attempting to separate the parties in the
basement, didn't you bite one of Miss Caroline's fingers so severely
that the blood ran down on your breast and spotted your shirt
bosom?</p>

<p><i>A</i>. No, sir. I did not&mdash;my linen was soiled, but it was caused by
my nose bleeding, and not by biting her finger.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. What caused your nose to bleed, doctor? (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. I don't know, except it was the excitement of the affray between
the women.</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. What's the best cure for nose bleed, doctor? (<i>Great
laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. I'm not here to answer this question, sir. (<i>Great laughter,
during which some one was heard to say in sotto voce, "put ice in your
breeches."</i>)</p>

<p>The policeman who arrested Miss Caroline was then called and
testified that she was very violent and mighty stormy when he entered
the basement.</p>

<p><i>Recorder</i>. Well, Caroline, what have you got to say about this
business?</p>

<p><i>Caroline</i>. It's all a piece of spite against me, because I threatened
to expose her carryings on with her lovers; they and she irritated me
to it. I had to go to the Battery that morning to meet a gentleman,
and as I didn't get to bed till late, for we sometimes don't go at all if
there's no company, and hardly ever, till 4 o'clock, I didn't get back
in time for breakfast; I went into the kitchen and the girl said there
was nothing but cold coffee, and I don't like cold coffee, and she gave
me some sauce, and I threw the coffee on the table. At this the girl
went up stairs, and down came Miss Jane, like a raving fury, and commenced
calling me all sorts of names, such as your honors would
blush to hear, and I called her names back, so I did. She then
clinched me and I clinched her, and instantly one of her lovers, Dr.
Adolph Fall, who stands over there, rushed in and took her part and

<!-- page 74 -->

endeavored to choke me off. He shoved me against the wall, and I
pushed my hand out against his face, so as to prevent him, when he
clinched one of my fingers with his teeth and bit it to the bone, so that
the blood run all over the bosom of his shirt.</p>

<p><i>Recorder</i>. Is Dr. Fall often there?</p>

<p><i>A</i>. Oh yes, bless you; he and Joe A&mdash;&mdash; are always there.
(<i>Great laughter</i>.) A&mdash;&mdash; was there that morning, and he hid himself
in a clothes press up stairs. (<i>Roars</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Is Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; a doctor, too? (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>A</i>. O no, Lord bless you&mdash;he's a music man in Broadway, somewhere&mdash;(<i>roars
again</i>)&mdash;but they're both lovers of hers; she sometimes
has both of them in the house at once; one in the basement and the
other in her room up stairs. (<i>Snorting laughter. Prince John, with
one hand in his pocket, moving for the door</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Do they board there?</p>

<p><i>A</i>. Not regularly, or to pay for it, but they dine very often with
the girls, for they do anything that Miss Jane tells them to do. (<i>Great
laughter</i>.) A&mdash;&mdash; takes breakfast very often in the morning, and Dr.
Fall comes in the evening&mdash;the doctor made her a present of a kissing
chair, (<i>roars</i>) a few days since, and she wants to have me punished
because I laughed and talked about it&mdash;I couldn't help it, I'll assure
you I couldn't, to think of her kissing, as she is old enough to be my
mother. (<i>Roars of laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Q</i>. Caroline, I'm afraid you've got a bad temper, and if we let you
go you'll assail her again in the house.</p>

<p><i>A</i>, (<i>Witness crying</i>.) I'm as quiet and as good natured as any
girl is, and how can I do anything to her when Dr. Fall and Joe
A&mdash;&mdash; are always in the house? If the court will let me go this time,
I'll never go near her place again, I'll assure you, as soon as I get my
clothes away from there.</p>

<p><i>Recorder</i>. The court have consulted about your case, and under
the circumstances we shall order you to be confined in the city prison
ten days, in hopes you may conclude to quit this course of life and enter
some Magdalen asylum for penitence and reformation.</p>

<p>Caroline then left the court, attended by her escort to the prison
entrance.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">SCENES IN A BOARDING HOUSE, IN WHICH A BEAUTIFUL BUT MYSTERIOUS
YOUNG WIDOW FIGURES.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE are certain phases in the boarding-house life in this city
that are rich in scenes of gaiety, love and depravity. The quantity
of wickedness cloaked in some instances under the name of boarding-house,
would, if exposed, appear to most people frightful.</p>

<p>The following scenes are taken from real life, and are illustrative
of a great deal of similar life every day occurring in various parts of
the city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith has a large house elegantly furnished in Houston-street,
and her rooms filled with boarders.</p>

<p>In describing the group, conspicuous among them appears a decayed,
or decaying doctor, a widower, who lives on his money, and
liberally enjoys the best of liquors. He occupies the back-parlor,
which seemed to be the head-quarters of the landlady also, and if rumor
did not belie her, she was, in the poetic language of Burns,</p>

<p class="center">"The lass that made the bed to him."</p>

<p>Among the other boarders were a merchant, two clerks, a young
doctor, who could not pay his board bill, and two young men with
plenty of money and up to any thing.</p>

<p>The landlady was a buxom widow of forty, full of life, gaiety,
romance, and of the utmost liberality in speech and manners. She
was blessed with two daughters, fifteen and seventeen years of age,
who were chips of the old block, and the youngest one, all block.</p>

<p>It happened one day that Mr. Curry, a Wall-street broker, an old
familiar acquaintance of Mrs. Smith, called to obtain board for Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;n, a young widow, then boarding in his family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith knowing the piety and excellent character of the
broker's wife, and consequently feeling assured that from the circumstance
of the widow's residing in such a family, she must be quite
orthodox in all the proprieties of life, accordingly took her in.</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>A few days after, a young gentleman who represented himself as a
merchant from the South, came with his most beautiful wife and took
board.</p>

<p>One day, after a frolicsome evening in the parlor, when the rest of
the company had retired, the landlady, Mrs. Smith, called a dashing
young man&mdash;Mr. Jones&mdash;one of her boarders, to her, and in low confidential
tone, said:</p>

<p>"There is to be a private fancy dress ball at a friend's of mine, in
a few days; would you like to attend?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, nothing will please me more."</p>

<p>"Mind you now, this is all to be kept a secret, and there will be
some pretty girls there, and you can fall in love with them as much
as you please."</p>

<p>"That's capital! Just what I like!"</p>

<p>"You must keep it all a secret."</p>

<p>"To be sure I will."</p>

<p>"I'll explain to you confidentially all about it. I have a friend
residing in Liberty-street."</p>

<p>"O, yes! I know her! It was the lady you introduced to me at the
dinner-table the other day. Mrs. Elwood&mdash;is not that the lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is she."</p>

<p>"I thought so," replied Jones, touching his thumb to the nasal extremity,
and gyrating his digitals in a very significant manner.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know her before?"</p>

<p>"No; but I have known her since, and know who it was that went
to Boston with her, whom she pretended was her husband. The day
I saw her at your table she slyly invited me to call on her, and I have
been several times to see her."</p>

<p>"Well, since you know something about her, I'll tell you all I
know of her. I have been acquainted with her since she was married
a dozen years ago to a very nice young man. He took it into his
head one day to get jealous of a young lawyer, and perhaps he had
cause. At any rate, he got up one morning, took his trunk and
clothes and went off, leaving her with the furniture. She then lived
with the lawyer, who now oftentimes passes as her husband, though
in her house she styles herself as a widow. You know she lets out
rooms to single gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I know she is regarded a very respectable and nice lady by her
lodgers and by the neighbors."</p>

<p>"Well, as to the ball. She is in the practice of giving some very
private and select balls."</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>"Who will be there?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, for it is a rule that none shall know each other.
You will be introduced to the company, but by some fictitious name,
and if you ever see any of the party hereafter in any other place, you
are not to know them."</p>

<p>"What sort of company is it?"</p>

<p>"All very respectable. Every lady present will be of the highest
respectability."</p>

<p>"Are you going?" asked Jones.</p>

<p>"To be sure I am." answered Mrs. Smith, in a bold tone.</p>

<p>"Are there any others going whom I know?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and though it is against the rules to tell, yet I'll tell you.
The young widow is going, and Mrs. Parrot, and Mrs. Clark. Mrs.
Parrot, you know, is the young lady that has just come here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her. Her pretended husband is a notorious gambler,
and she is his paramour. They have just come from New Orleans to
spend the summer at the North."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew something about that&mdash;you'll keep it secret. She
is a beautiful lady and knows how to behave with propriety."</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs. Clark?"</p>

<p>"The lady I introduced you to the other day. She is rich, and has
got a very nice young man for a husband, but as she has all the
money, he has to do just as she tells him. He can't buy a suit of
clothes without her permission. But he'll never know of her going to
this ball."</p>

<p>"Who is this young widow, now with you?" asked Jones.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Mr. Curry, and an old friend, brought her here.
She says he is her trustee, and has the management of her funds.
She was in his family a short time, but Mrs. Curry cleared her out.
and he brought her here. Mrs. Curry, I have heard, is a very
unhappy woman."</p>

<p>After this conversation, the parties retired&mdash;the one to ponder on
schemes for new intrigues, and the other, young Jones, to dream of
the fancy ball.</p>

<!-- page 78 -->

<div class="center" id="ad13">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE FANCY BALL.</p>

</div>

<p>THE scene is now in Mrs. Elwood's house in Liberty-street.</p>

<p>She had taken advantage of a temporary absence of her lodgers
to give a fancy ball, which not only brought her friends together
for the enjoyment of rare sport, but also served to replenish her
purse&mdash;for the tickets of admission were five dollars for a gentleman
and lady.</p>

<p>The rules required that all should meet and part as strangers, and
not recognise each other afterward, should they happen to meet, except
by mutual consent.</p>

<p>While together, the utmost freedom of social intercourse was to be
permitted, and all were to consider themselves at liberty to chat and
flirt to their heart's content.</p>

<p>There were present on this evening about twenty persons, among
whom were several beautiful ladies; but the belle of the room was
the young and mysterious widow, Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;n.</p>

<p>She had a tall queenly form, graceful carriage, and a most lovely
and expressive countenance, black eyes, dark hair, and an arm like
Pico's.</p>

<p>She was dressed in the character of the "Indian Queen," which
was at that time the rage at the Olympic, and which gave her an
excellent opportunity to display to the greatest advantage the peerless
beauty of her form; her principal dress being a species of frock coat,
which, for a gentleman, would have been of good length. Her arms
were bare, and like polished marble. Her dress displayed an ivory
neck, and gave indications of a bust, which, when moved by the deep
heavings of passion, might call forth sighs from the bosom of an
anchorite.</p>

<p>She, together with Mrs. Smith, who was not in costume, came with
Mr. Jones.</p>

<!-- page 79 -->

<p>It would be superfluous to describe the dress of the others. Though
all were not in costume, yet all were dressed in the gayest style, and
had come to indulge in the freest mirth, and to abandon themselves to
the pleasures and excitements of the moment.</p>

<p>The first of the evening passed off with the greatest hilarity. The
music was fine and the dance went briskly.</p>

<p>The widow was the great point of attraction, but her society was
chiefly monopolized by her attendant, young Jones, who had begun to
be separately in love with her. Some heart-burnings and jealousies
arose, but soon they were drowned in the waves of mirth, and the
dance, and music and wine.</p>

<p>The supper-hour came, when the party sat down to a munificently
spread table, loaded with the choicest viands, and sparkling with
wines.</p>

<p>Young Jones was seated between Mrs. Smith and the widow, the
latter of whom absorbed all of his attention. They supped and drank
deep of the wine, and after having removed from table, retired by
themselves, leaving others to renew the dance, in which but few now
participated.</p>

<p>Young Jones, when alone with the widow, strove with all his art
to draw from her a confession of her career, but in vain. He could
learn from her only that she had been married, and was now a widow.
He, however, confessed his love in no moderate terms, and vowed he
would cling to her till death.</p>

<p>The artful widow professed to reciprocate a degree of love, and
afterward turned the passion of her admirer to great advantage to
herself, in the shape of costly and valuable presents.</p>

<p>On returning to the dance, young Jones took Mrs. Elwood for a
partner, and became so much interested in her witty and intelligent
conversation, as almost to forget the star that had hitherto twinkled in
the firmament of his thoughts.</p>

<p>From this agreeable lady he learned much of the world, and was
made acquainted with the position and character of many of the actors
in the scene before them.</p>

<p>"Tell me, I beg of you, who is that lively, enchanting girl, in the
character of a Swiss peasant?"</p>

<p>"You know it is against the rules to tell what we know of each
other; yet, as this lady has desired an introduction to you,
and as she does not now profess to much secresy, I will tell you who
she is.</p>

<p>"She is a native of Halifax, where her father was a physician, but

<!-- page 80 -->

dying, and leaving his family unable to support themselves in the
style in which they were accustomed to live, the sons entering into
business, the mother and an only daughter came to this city, where
the latter teaching at first in a school at Bloomingdale, at length set
up for herself. Soon after her mother dying, and she herself marrying
a Southern gentleman, went to the South to reside.</p>

<p>"For two summers he left her alone, and came to New York, to
amuse himself without her.</p>

<p>"Suspecting all was not right, she resolved to accompany him this
season; and they came on together in May, and put up at the Astor
House. Here she soon discovered that her husband was a gambler,
and that other objects drew off his attention from her, leaving her at
times several days together without coming near her. Being thus
alone, she called on a former female friend, who is also a good friend
of mine. She was introduced to me. I found her a woman of spirit,
and sense; and knowing that she had herself alone to depend on, determined
on an independent course of action. She still remains at the
Astor House, where her husband occasionally visits her, and pays her
board; but, as to her conduct, he knows nothing of that."</p>

<p>"Who is that gentleman with her?"</p>

<p>"He is the Secretary of the French Legation, and is a great
admirer of this deserted woman, who possesses much wit and
intelligence."</p>

<p>It was near morning before the party broke up, when young Jones
accompanied his two partners home, and retired to rest&mdash;but not to sleep,
for he lay in a waking and bewildered dream of the new and exciting
scenes he had witnessed and participated in.</p>

<p>Soon Mrs. Smith became quite jealous of the widow, and a quarrel
ensued, which ended by an accusation against her by the widow, who
alledged that the former had stolen a sum of money from her trunk.</p>

<p>Officers were sent for, and a search made throughout the whole
house, and to which all the boarders were obliged to submit.</p>

<p>During this pell-mell, it leaked out, through the tongue of the
widow, that Parrot was a gambler, and his pretended wife no wife at
all. Strange hints were also thrown out regarding Mrs. Elwood,
who, as a frequent visitor, was known to all the boarders.</p>

<p>The consequence was, several of the more respectable boarders
packed up their things to depart, when the Parrots and the widow
received their walking-ticket.</p>

<p>The widow and young Jones, on this affray, took a tour to Boston,
while Mrs. Smith soon afterward filled her house with a new set of

<!-- page 81 -->

boarders, and all things went on as smooth and as jolly as though
nothing of an unpleasant nature had ever occurred.</p>

<p>Young Jones has since got married, but not to the widow, who is
now boarding at a very respectable boarding-house not far from
Union Square, and who, if she sees this, will recognize some scenes
in which she has borne a part, but who has sense enough to keep to
her own counsel.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">A WORD ABOUT GAMBLERS.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE are in this city some half a score or more of tip-top gambling
concerns, furnished in the most elegant style, and which offer to their
guests most magnificent suppers.</p>

<p>There has been recently opened an establishment to which but few
can gain admittance. It is furnished in the most elegant style, surpassing
any establishment of the kind ever known in this country.
All its furniture was imported from Paris, for its mirrors and rich
paintings dazzle the sight, and the foot rests upon the softest carpets of
Turkey. But of this we say no more at present.</p>

<p>Besides this there are more than a hundred shops of a lower grade,
where the business is carried on upon a gradually reduced scale,
until you reach the Five Points, where in some damp cellar or rotten
garret you behold a group of ebony-faces grinning around a pine
table, and lighted by a tallow candle stuck in a glass bottle.</p>

<p>But it is the medium or better grade of gamblers that do the
most mischief, and decoy the greatest number of victims into their
snares.</p>

<p>To recruit the victims of their diabolical trade, the gamblers of this
city have a regular system of police established upon all new-comers
to the city, whose business it is to watch the arrivals at the hotels and
ascertain who among them are likely subjects to be operated upon.
The spies employed in this business are often men of considerable address,
and make a flashy genteel appearance, very impressive and
taking with greenhorns. The principal means of leading strangers
into the trap are an introduction to the innumerable houses of ill-fame,
the inmates of all of which are connected with one or the other of the
gambling-houses.</p>

<p>The decoy knows how to make himself agreeable to the stranger&mdash;points
out the various curiosities of the city, supplies him with information

<!-- page 83 -->

respecting the various localities&mdash;tells him where the Post
Office, the Exchange, the Custom House, &amp;c., &amp;c., can be found&mdash;and
makes himself useful in a variety of ways. At evening they
adjourn to the bar&mdash;fortify themselves with a julep&mdash;and by
the time it is scientifically imbibed, Mr. Greenhorn is ripe for anything.</p>

<p>A walk is proposed; and in the course of a lounge in the Battery
or a saunter up Broadway the city gentleman meets a female acquaintance,
splendidly dressed and uncommonly sociable and condescending.
Mr. Greenhorn is at once introduced, and the lady politely
invites both gentlemen to call round in the course of the evening and
see her. The countryman is delighted with such an unusual exhibition
of hospitality, and begins to think New York is a leetle the cutest
place anywhere this side of sundown.</p>

<p>Once fairly in the harlot's den, and his fate is sealed. Bewildered
with the strangeness of all he sees and hears, overcome by flattery
and attentions, he does not refuse a glass of champagne, which
is drugged with a small quantity of morphine, just enough to inspire
self-confidence and audacity; and the spy finds no difficulty in
leading a willing victim to the gambling-house, where he is scientifically
plucked, and left to make his way to his hotel, a ruined,
miserable man.</p>

<p>Going still another step downward in our researches, we come upon
the penny poker dens of the thieves and negroes of the Five Points and
other similar localities. These are indescribably filthy and abominable
holes, into which a man with healthy lungs might penetrate with
about as much safety as he would go down a well with an air-damp at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Here the various grades of small thieves and pickpockets may be
seen, huddled together over a dark table, shuffling a pack of greasy
and worn-out cards, drinking villainous brandy and fire-new whiskey&mdash;swearing,
quarrelling, fighting, and making the reeking air thick
with blasphemy. In these dens men and women are indiscriminately
mingled&mdash;and such men! but more especially, such women!</p>

<p>The enemy of mankind could not possibly desire more fitting and
accomplished instruments to perform all his dirtiest jobs upon earth.
Here the striking characteristics of gambling-houses, groggery and
brothel are brought in the strongest relief. Whoever glances at one
of these places, has indelibly stamped upon his brain a picture of human
degradation which the most vivid imagination would attempt in
vain to conceive.</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>In going about the city, in preparing to discharge a task such as
we have undertaken, and exploring the mysteries of these veritable
internal regions, one no longer wonders at the amount and frequency
of crime. He only is astonished that it is not an hundred times as
great.</p>

<p>We have hinted that the gambling-houses of all grades were well-known
to the police, and we now repeat that there is not an officer or
policeman in the city who doesn't know one or more of these places,
and has not in his possession positive evidence of their true character.
"Well then, why are they not suppressed and their keepers punished
according to law?"</p>

<p>If we could answer that question so that the people could see it
exactly as it is, we could revolutionize society and reform the world.
We may say, in general terms, that all these establishments contain
or control <i>votes</i>&mdash;the whole end, aim and means of office-holders and
politicians. There is, doubtless, an immense amount of private
bribery of officers by the keepers of these and other unlawful establishments.
But the great thing is votes.</p>

<p>So long as the party in power can maintain the ascendency by
winking at a hundred and fifty notorious gambling-houses, keeping
dark about fifteen hundred public brothels, and licensing two thousand
superfluous groggeries, so long we shall look in vain for any thorough,
radical and all-embracing system of municipal reform, commended for
the benefit of the people and carried out in complete good faith and
honor.</p>

<p>But we repeat, the gambling-shops will never be suppressed while
the authorities themselves are involved in this disgraceful calling.
There is scarcely a Common Council in which there is not a professed
gambler in one or both boards. One of the aldermen from one of the
first five wards was with his paramour notoriously known as the
keeper of a <i>famous</i> infamous house.</p>

<p>While such a state of things continue, it is in vain to hope for any
attempt at vigilance or faithfulness in the execution of the laws.</p>

<p>It is well known that the gamblers confine their operations not to
cards or dice, but that politics is one of the means of gambling. Indeed
it has been said that the gamblers control our elections, and that
no persons are so well informed of the state of parties and of the means
predicting or rather of predetermining future elections.</p>

<p>The gamblers have large bets at stake on all important elections,
particularly the Presidential election, and to facilitate their operations
have a complete and efficient organization extending to every State,

<!-- page 85 -->

by which they are not only able to exercise a great influence on the
votes of the people, but also to obtain exclusive information of the
political partialities of the people, and of the probable, if not certain
result of the elections in every part of the country.</p>

<p>To this scheme of political gambling many a victim has fallen. It
is not by bets among themselves that the gamblers carry on this game,
it is by drawing the ardent and inexperienced young politicians into
their snares that they flourish.</p>

<p>Their instruments by which they operate are conspicuous betting
politicians, who are furnished with means by gamblers to bring the
young and inconsiderate into their traps.</p>

<p>What effect the new law will have on this system of political gambling
remains to be seen. We trust it will be beneficial, but the
facility with which it may be evaded, or the impunity with which it
may in most cases probably be violated, will perhaps render it partially
ineffectual.</p>

<h3>UNCLE TOMITUDES.</h3>

</div>

<p>HERE is a miracle! or something, at
least, that has not happened before,
and consequently, for which the world
was not prepared; for the belief of King
Solomon still prevails, that nothing will
be which has not already been, and every
new thing is incredible until it has been
duplicated. Uncle Tom, therefore, is a

<!-- vol 1 page 97 col 2 -->

miracle, his advent had not been foreseen
nor foretold, and nobody believes in him
now that he has come, and made good his
claim to be considered somebody. But,
Uncle Tom's superiors were not believed
in at first, and he can well afford to bide
his time.</p>

<p>Never since books were first printed

<!-- vol 1 page 98 col 1 -->

has the success of Uncle Tom been equalled;
the history of literature contains nothing
parallel to it, nor approaching it; it
is, in fact, the first real success in book-making,
for all other successes in literature
were failures when compared with the
success of Uncle Tom. And it is worth
remembering that this first success in a
field which all the mighty men of the
earth have labored in, was accomplished
by an American woman. Who reads an
American book, did you inquire, Mr.
Smith? Why, your comfortable presence
should have been preserved in the world
a year or two longer, that you might
have asked, as you would have done,
"who does not?"</p>

<p>There have been a good many books
which were considered popular on their
first appearance, which were widely read
and more widely talked about. But,
what were they all, compared with Uncle
Tom, whose honest countenance now
overshadows the reading world, like the
dark cloud with a silver lining. Don
Quixote was a popular book on its first
coming out, and so was Gil Blas, and
Richardson's Pamela, and Fielding's Tom
Jones, and Hannah More's C&oelig;lebs, and
Gibbon's Decline and Fall; and so were
the Vicar of Wakefield, and Rasselas, and
the Tale of a Tub, and Evelina, the Lady
of the Lake, Waverley, the Sorrows of
Werter, Childe Harold, the Spy, Pelham,
Vivian Grey, Pickwick, the Mysteries of
Paris, and Macaulay's History. These
are among the most famous books that
rose suddenly in popular esteem on their
first appearance, but the united sale of
the whole of them, within the first nine
months of their publication, would not
equal the sale of Uncle Tom in the same
time.</p>

<p>But this success does not, by any means,
argue that Uncle Tom is superior to all
other books; but it is an unmistakable
indication that it is a live book, and that
it will continue to live when many other
books which have been pronounced immortal,
shall be dead and buried in an
oblivion, from which there is no resurrection.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom is not only a miracle of itself,
but it announces the commencement
of a miraculous Era in the literary world.
A dozen years ago, Uncle Tom would
have been a comparative failure&mdash;there
might not have been more than a million
copies sold in the first year of its publication.
Such a phenomenon as its present
popularity could have happened only in
the present wondrous age. It required
all the aid of our new machinery to produce
the phenomenon; our steam-presses,
steam-ships, steam-carriages, iron roads,

<!-- vol 1 page 98 col 2 -->

electric telegraphs, and universal peace
among the reading nations of the earth.
But beyond all, it required the readers to
consume the books, and these have never
before been so numerous; the next year,
they will be more numerous still, and
Uncle Tom may be eclipsed by the shadow
of a new comer in the reading world.
It is not Uncle Tom alone who has made
the way for himself; the road to popularity
has been preparing for him, ever
since the birth of Cadmus; he has only proclaimed
the fact that the great avenues of
literature are all open, wide, and well paved,
and free to all who have the strength to
travel in them. Hereafter, the book which
does not circulate to the extent of a million
of copies, will be regarded as a failure.
What the first edition of a popular novel
will be by-and-by, when the telegraphic
wires will be printing it simultaneously,
in New-York, St. Petersburgh, San Francisco,
Pekin and the intermediate cities, it
is not easy to estimate. Then, when an
international copyright shall secure the
whole world to the popular author, for his
market, authorship, we imagine, will be a
rather more lucrative employment than it
happens to be at present. The possibility
of such a time does not appear half so improbable
now, as the actualities of Uncle
Tom would have sounded in the earlier
days of the Edinburgh Review.</p>

<p>It is but nine months since this Iliad
of the blacks, as an English reviewer calls
Uncle Tom, made its appearance among
books, and already its sale has exceeded a
million of copies; author and publisher
have made fortunes out of it, and Mrs.
Stowe, who was before unknown, is as
familiar a name in all parts of the civilized
world as that of Homer or Shakspeare.
Nearly two hundred thousand copies of
the first edition of the work have been
sold in the United States, and the publishers
say they are unable to meet the
growing demand. The book was published
on the 20th of last March, and
on the 1st of December there had been
sold one hundred and twenty thousand
sets of the edition in two volumes, fifty
thousand copies of the cheaper edition in
one, and three thousand copies of the
costly illustrated edition. The publishers
have kept four steam-presses running,
night and day, Sundays only excepted,
and at double the ordinary speed, being
equal to sixteen presses worked ten hours
a day at the usual speed. They keep two
hundred hands constantly employed in
binding Uncle Tom, and he has consumed
five thousand reams of white paper,
weighing seventy-five tons. They have
paid to the author twenty thousand three
hundred dollars as her share of the profits

<!-- vol 1 page 99 col 1 -->

on the actual cash sales of the first
nine months. But it is in England
where Uncle Tom has made his deepest
mark. Such has been the sensation produced
by the book there, and so numerous
have been the editions published, that
it is extremely difficult to collect the statistics
of its circulation with a tolerable
degree of exactness. But we know of
twenty rival editions in England and
Scotland, and that millions of copies have
been produced. Bentley has placed it
among his standard novels. Routledge
issues a handsome edition of it with a
preface by the Earl of Carlisle; and
this virtuous nobleman, with the blood
of all the Howards in his veins, sees nothing
out of the way in venting his indignation
against American Slavery, in the
preface of a book which is stolen from its
author and published without her consent.
Bentley also tacks on an "indignant preface"
to his edition, but it is stated that
he gives a per centage on the sale to the
author, which gives him a right to be indignant,
if he chooses. But the Earl of
Carlisle and Routledge might have reserved
their indignation against slavery, it
strikes us, until they had taken to honest
courses themselves. Another publisher in
London issues an edition and proposes to
share profits with the author, while a
penny subscription has been got up as a
testimonial to her from all the readers of
the work in Great Britain and Ireland.
We have seen it stated that there were
thirty different editions published in
London, within six months of the publication
of the work here, and one firm
keeps four hundred men employed in
printing and binding it. There have
been popular editions published also, in
Edinburgh and in Glasgow; and it has
been dramatized and produced on the
boards of nearly every theatre in the
Kingdom. Uncle Tom was played in
six different theatres in London at the
same time. An illustrated edition is now
publishing in London by a bookseller
named Cassell, the illustrations being furnished
by the famous and inimitable
George Cruikshank. The same publisher
has issued an Uncle Tom Almanac, with
designs by some of the most eminent artists
of London. The whole Beecher
family, of which Mrs. Stowe is a member,
have been glorified in the English
periodicals, and are exciting as much attention
just now, as the Napoleonic family,
to which they bear great resemblance;
one being a family of Kings and Queens,
and the other of preachers and authors&mdash;sovereigns
in the intellectual world.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom was not long in making his
way across the British Channel, and four

<!-- vol 1 page 99 col 2 -->

rival editions are claiming the attention of
the Parisians, one under the title of <i>le
P&egrave;re Tom</i>, and another of <i>la Case de
l'Oncle Tom</i>. But the fresh racy descriptions
of the author, lose their vigor and
force when rendered into French, though
the interest of the narrative remains. The
book reads better in German than in
French, and makes a deeper impression on
the Teuton than upon the Gallic mind.</p>

<p>The <i>Allgemein Zeitung</i>, of Augsburg,
says of it in the course of a long review:</p>

<p>"We confess that in the whole modern
romance literature of Germany, England
and France, we know of no novel to be
called equal to this. In comparison with
this glowing eloquence, that never fails of
its purpose, this wonderful truth to nature,
the largeness of these ideas, and the
artistic faultlessness of the machinery in
this book, George Sand, with her <i>Spiridion</i>
and <i>Claudie</i>, appears to us untrue
and artificial; Dickens, with his but too
faithful pictures from the popular life of
London, petty; Bulwer, hectic and self-conscious.
It is like a sign of warning
from the New World to the Old. In recent
times a great deal has been said about
an intervention of the youthful American
Republic in the affairs of Europe. In literature,
the symptoms of such an intellectual
intervention are already perceptible."</p>

<p>This is rather stronger praise, than any of
the French critics have bestowed upon Uncle
Tom, one of whom thinks it inferior to
Hildreth's Archy Moore. But Mrs. Stowe's
epic is more read in Paris, just now, than
any other book, and it is said to have a
greater success than any similar production
since the publication of Paul and Virginia.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom has found its way into Italy,
where there are more American travellers
than American books. Our <i>charg&eacute;</i>, at
Sardinia, reports that it is making its mark
there, as in other parts of Europe, in a
manner that astonishes the people. Two
editions in Italian have been published in
Turin, and one of the daily papers was
publishing it as a <i>feuilleton</i>, after the
manner of the Paris press.</p>

<p>What progress Uncle Tom has made in
the other northern nations of Europe, in
Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and
Lapland, we have not been informed; but
it is undoubtedly drawing its tears from the
eyes of the hyperboreans, as well as from
the inhabitants of the mild south. India
and Mexico, and South America, have yet
to be Uncle Tomitized, for we have not
heard of any editions of Mrs. Stowe's great
romance among the descendants of the
Aztecs, the Gauchos, or the Brazilians. It
must spread over the whole earth, like the
cholera, only reversing its origin and the

<!-- vol 1 page 100 col 1 -->

order of its progress. One of our newspaper
critics compares the Uncle Tomific,
which the reading world is now suffering
from, to the yellow fever, which does not
strike us as a very apt comparison, because
the yellow fever is confined wholly
to tropical climes, while Uncle Tom, like
the cholera, knows no distinction of climate
or race. He is bound to go; and
future generations of Terra-del Fuegians
and Esquimaux, will be making Christmas
presents at this season of the year, of Uncle
Tom's Cabin in holiday bindings.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable among the
phenomena that have attended the publication
of Uncle Tom has been the numerous
works written expressly to counteract
the impressions which the book was supposed
likely to make. This is something
entirely new in literature. It is one of
the most striking testimonials to the intrinsic
merit of the work that it should
be thought necessary to neutralize its influence
by issuing other romances to prove
that Uncle Tom is a fiction. Nothing
of the kind was ever before deemed necessary.
When Mrs. Radcliffe was bewitching
the novel-reading world with her
stories of haunted Castles there were no
romances written to prove that ruined
Castles were not haunted. But Uncle
Tom had scarcely seen the light when
dozens of steel pens were set at work to
prove him an impostor, and his author
an ignoramus. Some dozens of these anti-Uncle
Tom romances have been published
and many more of them remain in obscure
manuscript. We have had the
pleasure of looking over a score or two,
which were seeking a publisher, and nearly
all of them were written by women, upon
the principle of <i>similia similibus</i>. The
writer of one of these unpublished anti-Tom
novels had made a calculation, the
innocent ingenuity of which tickled our
very midriff. She had ascertained that
one hundred and fifty thousand copies of
Uncle Tom's Cabin had been sold, and she
calculated that every reader of that romance
would be anxious to hear the other
side of the story of domestic slavery, and
her romance being the silver lining of the
Southern institution, she came to a publisher
with a modest proposal based upon
a certain sale of one hundred and fifty
thousand copies of her work. But this
good lady had not made a greater mistake
than the majority of our reviewers
who have assumed that the "golden joys"
of Mrs. Stowe's authorship were all owing
to her having sung of Africa. Most unaccountably
they imagine that it is the
subject, and not the manner of its
treatment, that has fascinated the reading
public. But a more effete subject,

<!-- vol 1 page 100 col 2 -->

one of which the public were more
heartily wearied, which was more unwelcome
to ears polite than that of slavery,
it would not have been easy to select.
Whoever touched it was sure of that
cruelest of all martyrdoms: contemptuous
neglect. The martyr age of anti-slavery,
as Harriet Martineau called it, had passed
away, and the more fatal age of indifference
and contempt had succeeded. The
public had been inundated and surfeited
with anti-slavery sentiment in all possible
forms, from the fierce denunciations of the
Pilsbury Garrison school, down to the
mild objurgations of Lucretia Mott. Every
possible form of literary composition and
pictorial embellishment had been devoted
to the subject, and no one either needed, or
desired, any further enlightenment about
it, when Uncle Tom's Cabin was announced
to the world of novel readers.
The chances were a thousand to one
against the success of the book. And
yet it has succeeded beyond all other
books that were ever written. And the
cause is obvious; but, because it was obvious
and lay upon the surface, it has been
overlooked, there being an opinion among
most men that truth must lie a long way
out of reach.</p>

<p>"When I am reading a book," says
Dean Swift, in his Thoughts on Various
Subjects, "whether wise or silly, it seems
to me to be alive and talking to me."
This is the secret of the success of Uncle
Tom's Cabin; it is a live book, and it talks
to its readers as if it were alive. It first
awakens their attention, arrests their
thoughts, touches their sympathies, rouses
their curiosity, and creates such an interest
in the story it is telling, that they cannot
let it drop until the whole story is told.
And this is done, not because it is a tale
of slavery, but in spite of it. If it were
the story of a Russian Serf, an evicted
Milesian, a Manchester weaver, or an Italian
State prisoner, the result would be
the same. It is the consummate art of
the story teller that has given popularity
to Uncle Tom's Cabin, and nothing else.
The anti-slavery sentiment obtruded by
the author in her own person, upon the
notice of the reader, must be felt by
every one, to be the great blemish of
the book; and it is one of the proofs of
its great merits as a romance, that it has
succeeded in spite of this defect. If Mrs.
Stowe would permit some judicious friend
to run his pen through these excrescences,
and to obliterate a flippant attempt at Picwickian
humor, here and there, Uncle
Tom's Cabin would be a nearly perfect
work of art, and would deserve to be
placed by the side of the greatest romances
the world has known. It has often

<!-- vol 1 page 101 col 1 -->

been spoken of by critics as deficient in
artistic ability, but it is to its masterly
construction, or artistic quality, that it is
indebted for its popularity. The over-plus
of popularity given to the work by
its anti-slavery sentiment is not much
greater than the loss of readers from the
same source; but the evangelical sentiment
of the book, the conversions to holiness
through the influence of Uncle
Tom's preaching, which the <i>London
Times</i> cavilled at, is a greater cause of its
popularity with the religious classes, we
imagine, than the anti-slavery sentiment
which it contains. For the religious sentiment
of Uncle Tom is in strict accordance
with the theology of nine-tenths of
the Christian world. In all the great requisites
of a romance it is decidedly superior
to any other production of an American
pen.</p>

<p>There are not, in Uncle Tom's Cabin, any
of the delicacies of language which impart
so great a charm to the writings of Irving
and Hawthorne, nor any descriptions of
scenery such as abound in the romances
of Cooper, nor any thing like the bewildering
sensuousness of Typee Melville;
but there are broader, deeper, higher and
holier sympathies than can be found in
our other romances; finer delineations of
character, a wider scope of observation, a
more purely American spirit, and a more
vigorous narrative faculty. We can name
no novel, after Tom Jones, that is superior
to Uncle Tom in constructive ability.
The interest of the narrative begins in the
first page and is continued with consummate
skill to the last. In this respect
Thackeray is the first of cotemporary
English novelists, and Bulwer deserves
the next mention. But the commencement
of all of Thackeray's stories is dull
and uninviting, while Bulwer, who opens
briskly, and excites the attention of the
reader in the beginning, flags and grows
dull at the close. Mrs. Stowe, like Fielding,
seizes upon the attention at the outset,
and never lets it go for a moment
until the end. It matters not by what
means this is done, it is the chief object
aimed at by the romancer, and the greatest
artist is he who does it in the most
effectual manner; if the writer of fiction
fails in this point, he fails altogether. And
the same may be said of every other writer;
the mind must first be amused before
it can be instructed.</p>

<p>In no other American book that we have
read, are there so many well-delineated
American characters; the greater part of
them are wholly new in fiction. The mischievous
little imp Topsy, is a sort of infantine
Caliban, and all the other darkies
are delineated with wonderful skill and

<!-- vol 1 page 101 col 2 -->

freedom; and each page of the book is like
a cartoon of charcoal sketches. It has
been objected to Uncle Tom, that all the
whites are impossibly wicked, and all the
blacks are impossibly good. But nothing
could be further from the truth than such
an assertion; the most amiable of the
characters are some of the slave owners,
while the most degraded and vile are, of
course, the slaves. There is no partisanship
apparent in the narrative proper, and
if the author did not, occasionally, address
the reader in her own person, greatly to
her own prejudice, we should hardly suspect
her of anti-slavery leanings.</p>

<p>An ingenious writer in the <i>Literary
World</i> has done Mrs. Stowe the favor to
point out an instance of undeniable, but,
we presume, unconscious plagiarism, on
her part, for which she should feel herself
under great obligations to him. He
proves pretty clearly, that the weakest
part of Uncle Tom has been borrowed
from Mrs. Sherwood. Little Eva is, unquestionably,
nothing more than an adaptation
of the Little Henry of the English
lady; and, for our own part, we think it
very creditable to Mrs. Stowe that such
is the case. The little Nells, little Pauls,
little Henrys, and little Evas, are a class of
people for which we care but little. Dickens
has much to answer for in popularizing
the brood of little impossibilities, who are
as destitute of the true qualities of childhood
as the crying babies which are hung
up in the windows of toy-shops. One
Topsy is worth a dozen little Evas. But
it is a proof of the genius of the author,
that every character she introduces into
her story is invested with such a distinct
individuality that we remember it as a
new acquaintance, and feel a strong interest
in its fate.</p>

<p>We have heard of almost innumerable
instances of the power of Uncle Tom, but
one of the finest compliments that has
been ever paid to its fascinations was from
a Southern Senator and a slave-holder.
Somebody had persuaded him to read the
book, and, on being asked what he thought
of it, he merely replied that he should be
very sorry for his wife to read it. A friend
of ours was sleeping one night in a strange
house, and being annoyed by hearing
somebody in the adjoining chamber alternately
groaning and laughing, he knocked
upon the wall and said, "Hallo, there!
What's the matter? Are you sick, or
reading Uncle Tom's Cabin?" The stranger
replied that he was reading Uncle
Tom.</p>

<p>Apart from all considerations of the
subject, or motive, of Uncle Tom's Cabin,
the great success of the book shows what
may be accomplished by American authors

<!-- vol 1 page 102 col 1 -->

who exercise their genius upon
American subjects. Imitations of foreign
and classical literature, though equal to
the originals, will not command success.
The American author or artist who is ambitious
of success must confine himself to
the illustration of American subjects.
Cooper made his first essay upon foreign
ground and failed. He then came back
to America, with no better talent than he
carried abroad, and succeeded, having first
secured a reputation by the use of a home
subject, and then succeeded with foreign
materials. But Irving always wrote as an
American even when his theme was foreign.
There is yet remaining an uncultivated but
rich field for American genius. Our first
novel of society has yet to be written. We
are daily looking for the appearance of our
native novelist who shall take his place
by the side of Irving, of Cooper, of Melville,
and Hawthorne, and Mrs. Stowe.
Like the sister of Fatima, we can see a
cloud in the distance, but we cannot make
out the form of the approaching genius.
There are steam-presses and paper-mills
now erecting to welcome him. Our aborigines,
and sailors, and transcendentalists,
and heroes, and slaves, have all had their
Iliad, but our men and women of society
are yet looking for their Fielding, their
Bulwer, or their Thackeray.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 102 col 2 -->

<p>Some of the foreign correspondents of
our daily papers, in commenting on the
popularity of Uncle Tom in Europe, account
for it by saying that the English are
glad of an opportunity to circulate a book
which shows up our country to disadvantage.
But we do not perceive the force
of this argument. We do not think that
any degree of hatred to our institutions
could induce the people of Great Britain
to read a dull book. Besides, there have
been dozens of books published about
slavery, which throw Uncle Tom’s Cabin
completely in the shade in their pictures of
our domestic institutions. In fact, Mrs.
Stowe’s book gives a much more agreeable
picture of Southern slavery than any of
the works we have seen which profess to
give the right side of the tapestry. A
desire to degrade America surely cannot
be the reason why the representation of
dramatic scenes in Uncle Tom have proved
so attractive in our own theatres. For
our part, we think that the actual effect
of Mrs. Stowe’s romance will be to
create a much more indulgent and forgiving
spirit towards the people of the South
than has prevailed in England heretofore.
Our last presidential election certainly did
not afford any reason to believe that the
minds of our countrymen had been at all
influenced by Mrs. Stowe’s enchantments.</p>

<h3>ELEGANT TOM DILLAR.</h3>

</div>

<p class="center">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>TO speak of Tom Dillar in any other
way than by his pseudonym of Elegant,
would be like speaking of Harold
Harefoot, Edwin the Fair, the Black Prince,
or Louis the Debonnaire, without their
distinguishing adjectives. Tom Dillar was
known to his acquaintances only as Elegant
Tom, and he was well entitled to the
epithet, for he was elegant in looks, manners,
and style. He was one of those happy
persons who seem to have come into
the world for the sole purpose of eating the
sunny side of ripe peaches. There were
no deficiencies in Elegant Tom Dillar, and
if one could have the ordering of his own
antecedents, they could not be superior to
Tom's. On the side of his father, he was
connected with the best English families
in the State; and, by the mother's side,
he could boast of the purest Dutch descent.
He inherited a large fortune from
his father, and, what was much better, a
healthy constitution and a handsome person.
Being independent in his circumstances,
he was not educated for a profession;
but, being apt to learn, he was
taught a good many accomplishments that
are not generally bestowed upon American
youths. He could dance much better than
most professors of that elegant art, and in
music he was something more than a proficient
upon the guitar, the piano, and the
violin. Then he had a fine voice, a delicious
tenor, and those who had the good
fortune to hear him sing used to boast of
it, as though a piece of rare luck had befallen
them. Tom was good-natured too,
and as amiable as though it were necessary
for him to conciliate the world, that his
presence might not be considered an intrusion.
But, of all men, he was least
likely to be considered <i>de trop</i> in the world.</p>

<p>He went abroad, and came back as
amiable and unpretending as he went,
but with more accomplishments than
he carried away. He was invited every
where, and he might have married
any girl he chose to honor in that
manner; but, as often happens in such
cases, he seemed never to have been
touched in his heart by any of the beautiful
creatures who surrounded him.
There was Fanny Ormolu, the only daughter
of the great auctioneer, who, they used
to say, was dying for him; and it was
said that her father was so fearful of the
effects of Tom's indifference on his daughter's
health, that he was guilty of the indelicacy
of offering to settle a hundred
thousand dollars on him if he would marry
her. But Tom had never known what it

<!-- vol 1 page 525 col 2 -->

was to want money, and, like an honorable,
high-minded fellow as he was, refused
to sell himself, even at so high a
figure, and to so beautiful a purchaser.</p>

<p>They say that old Ormolu was so exasperated
and indignant at Tom's refusal,
that he swore he would have satisfaction
for the insult; and he was as good as his
word. He did not challenge Tom, nor,
indeed, permit him to know that he entertained
any ill-will against him; for, if he
had, he probably would not have been
able to accomplish his purpose. Ormolu
was a commercial gentleman, and his
manner of getting satisfaction was a purely
business transaction: in fact the old fellow
did not understand any thing else.
He set himself deliberately to work to
ruin Tom by getting away all his money.
As this would have been the severest
punishment that could have been inflicted
upon himself, he naturally and very sensibly,
imagined that he could inflict no
greater wrong upon another than by making
him a bankrupt.</p>

<p>Now, Tom was not a spendthrift, nor a
gambler; but then he was the merest
child in business matters, and had no
idea about money transactions beyond
drawing his dividends every six months,
and contriving to make his income just
meet his expenditure. Tom had often
wished that his income was larger, for he
had long been ambitious of owning a
yacht, but was unable to indulge in that
costly enjoyment; so, when his young
friend, Pete Van Slicer, of the firm of Van
Slicer, Son &amp; Co., the great stockbrokers,
of Wall-street, one day said to him, as if
by accident, "Tom, how would you like
to enter into a little speculation, by which
you might make a hundred thousand dollars
or so?" Tom opened his eyes, and eagerly
replied he would like nothing better.</p>

<p>Pete then carelessly remarked, that Bob
So-and-so had made nearly double that
sum a few days before, by a corner in
Harlem, and that he could put Tom in
the way of making at least that amount by
a speculation in Pottawattamy Coal Stock.
Tom, not being familiar with stock operations,
asked how it could be done; whereupon
Pete explained to him that certain
parties having sold long in the stock were
going to get up a corner, which would
compel the shorts to buy in, and that the
stock would then begin to rise, and there
was no knowing where it would stop.
What Pete proposed that Tom should do
was, to buy in while it was down, and
when the rise should reach its height to
sell out, and pocket the profits.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 526 col 1 -->

<p>"Can I rely on the rise taking place?"
asked Tom, who had not a very clear notion
of the nature of the transaction.</p>

<p>"Trust to me," replied Pete, with a
knowing wink, which seemed to Tom so
full of sagacity, that he concluded to trust
to him, and accordingly gave an order to
the firm of Van Slicer, Son &amp; Co., to purchase,
for his account, about ten times as
many shares of the Pottawattamy Coal
Stock as he had the means to pay for,
Pete undertaking to carry the stock, as
he called it, for thirty days, in which time
the rise was sure to occur.</p>

<p>Having made this little business arrangement
with his Wall-street friend,
Tom jumped into one of the Dry Dock
stages, to go up to the ship-yards and
make inquiries about the cost of a yacht;
and that night he dreamed of winning the
Queen's cup at the Cowes regatta, and of
lying at anchor in the harbor of Newport,
and other pleasant things connected with
the manly sport of yachting.</p>

<p>Tom did not know that his friend, Pete
Van Slicer, was paying attention to Fanny
Ormolu; and, even if he had, he could
never have imagined that old Ormolu was
making use of the young stockbroker to
ruin his friend. But such was the fact.
The next day Elegant Tom Dillar created
a good deal of surprise among the
motley throng of Jews and "lame ducks"
that hover round the doors of the Stock
Board in the third story of the Merchants'
Exchange; and when a playful Hebrew
knocked Tom's hat over his eyes, as he stood
anxiously waiting to hear what Pottawattamy
sold at, he was so engrossed in his
new speculation, that he never thought of
resenting the affront. Pottawattamy went
up one per cent. that day, but the next it
went down ten, and the next ten more,
and Tom received a brief note from Van
Slicer, Son &amp; Co., informing him that he
was their debtor for losses on Pottawattamy
Coal Stock, in a sum that considerably
exceeded his entire fortune.</p>

<p>A man who has never felt the actual
cautery of poverty, cannot have a very
clear idea of what that word really means,
and Tom did not, therefore, feel half so
badly as he ought to have done, when he
had to confess to himself that he was a
bankrupt.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be gained by going
into the distressing particulars of Tom's
settlement with his brokers, and therefore
I will merely remark, that on the very
day upon which all his available property
passed out of his own hands into those of
Van Slicer, Son &amp; Co., the junior member
of that eminent firm was united in the
holy bonds of matrimony, as the papers
say, to Fanny Ormolu, only daughter and

<!-- vol 1 page 526 col 2 -->

so forth, of Jefferson Ormolu, Esq., our
enterprising and esteemed fellow-citizen,
of the eminent firm of Ormolu, Bronze
&amp; Co.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

</div>

<p>The ruin of Thomas Dillar, Esq., was
complete. Wall-street never witnessed a
more decided cleaning out than in the
case of my elegant friend. It was so
smoothly and rapidly done, that he was
like the man who didn't know he was
decapitated until he attempted to nod his
head&mdash;so sharply, so adroitly, and so quickly,
had the blow been dealt. But it does
not take long for a person to find out that
he is poor, and Elegant Tom Dillar immediately
began to have a "realizing sense"
of the true state of his case. He had
nothing in the world left but his watch,
and a few articles of jewelry, by which
he could raise money enough to discharge
the few debts he owed, and which were
demanded with a rude pertinacity that he
had never known before. He had to
abandon the hotel in Broadway at which
he had been living, and take cheap lodgings
in Beekman-street; and, instead of
having more invitations to dine than he
could accept, he suddenly found himself
without any invitation at all; as to evening
parties, although he had made up his
mind not to go to any more, he had the mortification
of being cut by all his old friends,
and soon ceased to expect any attentions
from them. Heretofore Tom had skimmed
the cream of human existence; he had
visited only in the best circles, eaten the
best dinners, drank the best wines, read
the most amusing books, worn the best
clothes, and had known nothing of the
infelicities of human existence, except
by hearsay. But now his turn had come
to feed on husks, and taste of hyssop.</p>

<p>What Tom had suffered, or how he had
struggled, none knew but himself, for he
was too proud to complain, and, to all
appearances, he was as light-hearted and
cheerful as ever he had been in his most
prosperous days. But, as the writer of
these lines was one evening hurrying
down Broadway, to escape from the
clouds of blinding dust which a cold,
northwest wind was driving along that
crowded avenue, he was suddenly arrested,
near the comer of Canal-street,
by a tap on the shoulder. Turning
round, he saw Elegant Tom Dillar, with
his coat buttoned closely up to his throat,
and looking uncomfortably sharp, serious,
and, to make use of a vulgar figure of
speech, seedy.</p>

<p>"How are you?" said Tom, in his

<!-- vol 1 page 527 col 1 -->

usual elegant manner; but, without waiting
for a reply, he continued, "you
needn't ask me how I am, for I can discern
by your looks that you see how I
am. I am hungry."</p>

<p>Elegant Tom Dillar hungry!</p>

<p>I was too much shocked by this humiliating
confession from a man whom I had
known and envied in his happier days,
to disguise my feelings. But I put my
hand in my pocket to feel for my purse.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom, "it is very
generous in you to anticipate my request.
It is but a trifle that I need; and I will
repay you soon."</p>

<p>I offered him the contents of my purse;
but he would not take more than half a
dollar. "At least," said I, "allow me to
treat you to a supper, since you say you
are hungry?"</p>

<p>"I will agree to that," he replied, "upon
the condition that you favor me with
your company, and allow me to call for
what I want."</p>

<p>Of course, I could not refuse his proposition,
and, knowing what his former
habits had been, I supposed he would go
into some of the splendid restaurants on
Broadway, and call for such a supper as
he had once been accustomed to indulge
in. But, on the contrary, he led me into
one of the cross streets, and I followed
him down into a very humble underground
"Saloon," where he ordered a
supper of cold meat and bread, and I
could not prevail upon him to indulge in
any thing more.</p>

<p>"You know something of my history,"
said Tom, "how I once lived, and how I
lost my property; but how I have lived
since, you do not know, and I shall not
distress you by telling. Look," said he,
and he unbuttoned his threadbare coat,
when I saw that he had on neither vest
nor shirt. "I am actually reduced to this
extreme," said he, and his voice quivered
as he spoke, "by trying to live honestly.
Up to this very hour, until I met you, I
have not stooped to beg; but now I was
driven to it. I had nothing left by which
I could raise a shilling, and I had not
tasted food to-day."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said I, "can this be
true? What, Elegant Tom Dillar, with
all his accomplishments, his rich acquaintances,
his knowledge of the world, and in
a city like this, where employment is so
readily obtained, reduced to starvation!
It cannot be true."</p>

<p>"But it is true," said Tom, "impossible
as it may seem to you, and all because I
was not brought up to a regular profession.
My accomplishments were not of a
kind to bring me money in an honorable
way, and I made up my mind that if I

<!-- vol 1 page 527 col 2 -->

could not live honorably, I would prefer
not to live at all. I could easily have
sold myself to unworthy or disreputable
employments, or my former friends would
probably have been glad to have had me
sing for them, and have rewarded me by
permitting me to live on their bounty, but
I could not submit to such a position as
that. I could never be a jack-pudding of
society; and I would not disgrace my father's
name by a dishonorable occupation."</p>

<p>As Tom spoke these words, he looked
more elegant in his shabby suit than ever
he had done in his happier days; and, in
spite of his poverty, I could not but still
admire his manly spirit and self-reliance.
I actually felt poor beside him.</p>

<p>"But," said I, "why will you not allow
me to lend you a larger sum than you
have taken? You shall be heartily welcome
to more."</p>

<p>"Because," replied Tom, "it is all I
need. I think I have found a placer, and
after this, I shall be rich again."</p>

<p>I wished his expectations might be realized,
and, shaking his hand, I gave him
my card, and begged he would send to me,
if he should need any further assistance.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

</div>

<p>It was about three months after I parted
from Tom in the cheap restaurant, that,
as I entered the vestibule of the Astor
House, I met him coming out of that hotel.
I started back with amazement as I saw
him, for Tom was now dressed with greater
splendor than I had ever before seen him;
not obtrusively made up, but with an air
of studied elegance that was new to him.
Certainly he never looked better, nor better
deserved to be called Elegant Tom
Dillar. He appeared a little embarrassed
when he first caught my eye, but his old
manner soon returned. "I owe you a
trifle, I think," said he; "let me pay it."
And he pulled out a silk purse which
seemed to be full of gold and silver, and
reached me a half-dollar.<p>

<p>"That is the principal," said he; "now
do me the favor to accept this for interest;"
and he took a handsome seal ring from
his finger, which he put upon mine. As
our initials were the same, I do not know
whether he had had it cut for me or not;
but, seeing my cipher on the agate, I fancied
he had, and did not refuse it. I keep
it among my most precious mementoes of
past friendships, for Tom Dillar is one of
those persons whose acquaintance I regard
as a feather in my cap.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

</div>

<p>The reappearance of Elegant Tom Dillar
in what is called society, was a topic of

<!-- vol 1 page 528 col 1 -->

universal conversation in fashionable circles,
and once more invitations began to
pour in upon him, so that he might, if he
had had the capacity, have eaten three
dinners daily at the very best houses in
town, and have danced in the most brilliant
company that New-York could afford,
nearly every night. But a great
change was perceptible in Tom's manner.
He was the same Elegant Tom Dillar
he had ever been; faultless in his manner,
refined in his conversation, incredible
in dress, and handsomer, if possible,
than before his retirement. "But he is
so subdued in his style," was the remark
of every body. He never danced, and
when he was pressed to sing, he always
evaded the request by pleading a slight
hoarseness. There used to be a slight
dash of frivolity in Tom's conversation
and conduct, and he would abandon himself
to all kinds of merriment; but now
he was rather grave, quiet, and dignified,
and several ambitious young men made
most melancholy attempts to form themselves
upon his style. Another of his
changes was, that he wore his hair cut
very short, and his fine classical head was
improved by it. In fact, Tom's new style
was infinitely more interesting, becoming,
and distingu&eacute; than his old. Certain pious
ladies got their heads together, and, after
discussing the matter, came to the conclusion
that Tom Dillar was preparing himself
for the ministry. This suspicion even
gave a new interest to him, and he became
more than ever an object of observation.
But this theory was soon exploded;
for, if Tom were engaged in so pious an
occupation, under whose auspices was he
studying? On hearing the report, Tom
smiled sarcastically, and raised his eyebrows
as people do when they are both
surprised and amused, but did not deny
it. But, if he was not studying for the
ministry, what was he doing, and how did
he live? Where did he get his money?
for it was known that Tom paid as he
went, and not a soul of his acquaintance
could accuse him of borrowing.</p>

<p>These questions began to grow extremely
interesting and puzzling, for the manner
in which Tom had been cleaned out by his
speculation in Pottawattamy Coal Stock,
by his friend, Pete Van Slicer, was as notorious
as his subsequent poverty, and retirement
from the world. All sorts of expedients
were resorted to for the purpose of discovering
the secret of Tom's income; but
the mystery baffled the keenest investigation,
and the consequence was, that the
wildest conceivable stories were told about
him, and he was regarded with looks of suspicion,
and treated with cold disdain by certain
ladies who had marriageable daughters.

<!-- vol 1 page 528 col 2 -->

The excitement at last reached
its calenture when it was discovered that
Julia Laurens, daughter of the celebrated
and wealthy physician of that name, and
granddaughter of old Ormolu the auctioneer,
one of the most beautiful and
fascinating girls in society, had actually
fallen in love with Tom, and that he had
been forbidden her father's house because
he refused to tell how he gained his income.</p>

<p>The report of this interesting circumstance
invested the mystery of Tom's prosperity
with a romantic interest, and the
excitement became absolutely furious. It
was impossible to enter a house without
hearing the subject discussed, and even
merchants talked about it on 'Change. The
different theories which were broached
were highly instructive, inasmuch as they
revealed the many different methods by
which a man may contrive to live without
labor; but it so happened, that not one of
them came within a thousand miles of the
truth. Tom had, in fact, discovered a
placer, as he termed it, which he alone
knew how to work; and most discreetly
did he keep his secret, until, in a luckless
moment, the merest accident revealed it.</p>

<p>The women, poor simple-minded creatures,
knowing but little of the world, had
their own innocent surmises about Tom,
the most plausible of which was, that he
had entered into a league with the &mdash;&mdash;;
some other ladies, who had a less practical
acquaintance with human possibilities,
believed that he got his money by writing
poems for the magazines; while others
said that he gambled. But Tom's regular
habits and his placidity of temper were
adverse to the last supposition. The men,
of course, gave shrewder guesses; and one
party maintained, with some plausibility,
that Tom Dillar was employed as a Russian
spy. The difficulty in this case was,
that he never received any foreign letters,
was notoriously ignorant of political movements,
and never mingled in any society
where he would be likely to pick up any
information that would interest the Emperor
of Russia. Another party maintained
that he speculated in stocks; but
that theory was easily knocked in the
head: Tom had not been in Wall-street
since his speculation in the Pottawattamy
Coal Stock. Some ill-natured people
hinted that he was employed in circulating
counterfeit money; but he was closely
watched, and was never known to pass off
a bad bill. He was accused of picking
pockets, of buying lottery tickets, and
other disreputable practices; but the strict
integrity of Tom's conduct, and his perfect
frankness on all subjects concerning himself,
except that impenetrable mystery of

<!-- vol 1 page 529 col 1 -->

the source of his income, put every ungenerous
suspicion to rest. He was watched
when he went from a party, or the opera,
and was always found to go directly to
his lodgings, and there, too, would he be
found in the morning. Julia Laurens's
father had employed a police officer to
dodge Tom's footsteps, and discover what
his haunts were; but the man could learn
nothing more than was already known.
There was one rather striking peculiarity,
however, about Tom's movements, which
might lead to the discovery of the mystery.
Nobody had seen him, except on
Sunday nights, between the hours of seven
and ten. Every place of amusement in
the city was ransacked in vain, during
these hours, but no sign of Tom Dillar
could any where be found, and he continued
to be a subject of talk in society,
where he was still well received in spite
of all the evil things that were surmised
about him.</p>

<p>Julia Laurens was a spirited girl, and
she loved Tom the better, perhaps, because
he was the object of so much unjust
suspicion; and her father, the doctor, was
charmed by Tom's intelligence, his gentlemanly
manners, his fine taste, and his
amiability; and most happy would he have
been to acknowledge him as his son-in-law,
but for the mysterious silence which
he observed in respect to his income. But,
as Tom was resolute in his silence, the father
of Julia was inexorable, and there
was nothing left for them but a clandestine
marriage. The lady hinted at her willingness,
but Tom told her, dearly as he
loved her, he would not be guilty of a dishonorable
act to obtain her. He would
wait a little longer, and perhaps her father
would relent.</p>

<p>To fully appreciate Tom's noble conduct,
it should be known that Julia, in addition
to her expectations from her father's property,
which was already large, and rapidly
increasing, had property of her own,
valued at fifty thousand dollars, which had
been bequeathed her by an aunt. All this
Tom might have had, and the woman he
loved besides, but for his high-minded
sense of honor.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

</div>

<p>Doctor Laurens, Julia's father, was a
most passionate lover of music, and you
were always sure of seeing him in his box
at the opera, in his bright-buttoned coat,
with lorgnette in hand, listening to the
prima donna as though she were a patient,
and he anticipated a fee at the close of the
performance. He was so catholic in his
tastes that he could enjoy one kind of
music as well as another, and, when there

<!-- vol 1 page 529 col 2 -->

was no opera, and his patients would
permit it, he would go to hear the Ethiopian
Minstrels, and sit through the entire
performance. In fact, the banjo was one
of the Doctor's weaknesses, and there
were some people, who were uncharitable
enough to say that negro minstrelsy was
much better adapted to his musical taste,
than the Italian opera. But that was
mere scandal, of course, for the Doctor
had been in Europe, and had brought
back with him, like many other gentlemen
who go abroad, a taste for music and
the fine arts, which he did not carry with
him.</p>

<p>There was one member of the Ethiopian
band, where the Doctor was in the habit of
going, who had completely fascinated him,
which was not much to be wondered at, for
he had fascinated every body else who
heard him; and when he appeared, there
was sure to be an overflowing house. The
name of this incomparable singer was Higgins,
and his talents, as a banjo player, as
a dancer, and a personator of the negro
character, particularly as the negro dandy,
were equal to his splendid abilities as a
singer. The Doctor never failed to drop
into the Ethiopian opera, as it was called,
whenever this public favorite appeared,
which was nearly every night, and seeing
his name up on the bills for a benefit, the
Doctor resolved to go. On reaching the
hall he found the house so crowded, that
he could not even get his nose inside, but
the door-keeper recognized him, and wishing
to gratify so distinguished a patron of
the establishment, offered to show him
round by a private entrance, so that he
would be near the stage, and might retire
at his leisure.</p>

<p>The Doctor was delighted, and put something
handsome into the hand of the door-keeper,
as an acknowledgment for the
favor. He got a comfortable seat near the
stage, and waited with impatience for the
appearance of the incomparable Higgins.
The sham darkey was in splendid voice, and
filled the audience with ecstatic pleasure by
his happy imitations of Dandy Jim. But his
most brilliant performance was in the plantation
break-down, in which he ravished
the spectator by his unparalleled heeling
and toeing. In the midst of the performance,
when the frenzy of the spectators
was at its height, a boy in the gallery
threw a piece of orange-peel on the stage,
and Higgins, by an unlucky step put his
foot upon it, and fell with a tremendous
crash. The audience at first thought it
a part of the dance, and applauded tremendously,
but it was soon discovered that the
poor man had met with a serious accident.
He was taken up by his companions and
borne off the stage; directly after, the

<!-- vol 1 page 530 col 1 -->

leader of the band came on, and asked if
there was a surgeon in the house, as Mr.
Higgins was badly hurt by his fall.
Doctor Laurens was but too happy to
have an opportunity of rendering any
professional assistance to so distinguished
an artist as Higgins; so he stepped
promptly forward and offered his services.
The artist had struck his head, but was
only stunned. The Doctor, however, did
as all doctors do on such occasions,
whipped out his lancet and bled the patient,
while one of his companions, with a
bowl of water and a sponge wiped the
burnt cork from the face of the unconscious
minstrel.</p>

<p>Higgins presently opened his eyes, and
stared wildly about him, while the Doctor
shrieked out,</p>

<p>"Good gracious, it is Elegant Tom
Dillar!"</p>

<p>Tom was bewildered by the sudden
change of the scene, and faint and sick
from the loss of the blood which Doctor
Laurens had been letting out of his veins;
but, bewildered and weak as he was, the
sound of the Doctor's voice, and the sight
of his astonished countenance, brought
Tom to his senses. He knew at once
that his secret was discovered, and comprehended
in a moment the consequences
that must follow its revelation to society.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said he, faintly, "it is no
use to dissemble further. You know my
secret; let me request you to keep it to
yourself."</p>

<p>"O! my dear fellow," said the Doctor,
"you are perfectly safe in my hands;
don't be uneasy. For the credit of my
own family, at least, I shall not be likely
to proclaim to society that a gentleman
who has visited at my house, is a member
of a troupe of Ethiopian minstrels. I wish
you a good evening, sir."</p>

<p>It very oddly happened that, before
midnight, all the members of the Manhattan
Club, to which the Doctor belonged,
knew that Elegant Tom Dillar had retrieved
his fortunes by joining the Ethiopian
minstrels, and the news was spread

<!-- vol 1 page 530 col 1 -->

all through society before the next day at
noon.</p>

<p>Tom received a package early in the
morning from Julia, inclosing all the billets-doux
and trinkets he had sent her, and
requesting a return of all she had ever
sent him. The note was as devoid of feeling
or sentiment as a lawyer's dunning
letter; and Tom wrote one in reply, which
was quite as cold and business-like.</p>

<p>"Well," said I to Tom, on meeting
him a few days after his accident, which
would very likely have proved fatal
to him but for his woolly wig; "Do
you intend to give up society or the
minstrels?"</p>

<p>"Society!" exclaimed Elegant Tom
Dillar, with a sarcastic curve of his finely
chiselled lip; "Society be &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>I will not repeat the very coarse expression
he used; for, since his new associations,
he had grown rather rude and
low in his language.</p>

<p>"What should an honest man care for
society?" said he. "When I was an idler,
living on the property which my father's
industry had procured me, society petted
me and cherished me. When I lost my
property, society turned a cold shoulder to
me, but petted the villain who had robbed
me of it. When by an honest exercise of
the only accomplishments I had been
taught, I was enabled to appear like a
gentleman, society again received me with
open arms, although it imagined I was a
gambler or a pickpocket; but, when it
was found that my money was honestly
obtained&mdash;that I wronged no one, nor
owed any one&mdash;society rejects me again,
and the girl who was willing to marry
me as a swindler, turns her back upon
me as an honest man."</p>

<p>I am afraid that Tom was misanthropical;
for, as he soon after became possessed
of a considerable fortune by the death of a
relative, he quitted the minstrels and
went to Paris, where, I have heard, he
still lives in great splendor, and is famous
for his dinners, to which none of his countrymen
are ever invited.</p>

<h3>MISS BREMER'S HOMES OF THE NEW WORLD.</h3>

</div>

<p>COLERIDGE was hardly correct in
supposing that we Americans are
more nervous about the impression we
make upon the English, than upon the
travellers who visit us from other countries.
The curiosity to know what Miss
Bremer would say about us was never
more intense since European notorieties
first began to publish their opinions of
what they saw and heard on our side of
the Atlantic. The little, sentimental,
"potato-nosed" Swedish lady, had captivated
our entire reading population,
which includes nearly our whole people,
by her quaint and romantic pictures of
society in her native hyperborean home,
and it was very natural that those who
had tried to dazzle her by their attentions
should wish to know how they had succeeded.
The little lady has not left us in
the dark, or doubt on the subject. No
one can complain of a want of frankness
and transparent thinking on her part.
To make use of a Westernism, she records
her impressions "with a perfect looseness;"
and apparently with a most amiable
unconsciousness that there is any thing
at all improper in her doing so. She is,
in fact, the <i>enfant terrible</i> of travellers in
the United States; and her sayings are all
the more valuable and entertaining from
their innocent freshness. They were
made on the spot, and have none of the
dubious indistinctness and hesitancy of
second thoughts or remembered impressions.
When she slept in a cold bedroom
she notes it on the spot, if she was bored
by a formal dinner down goes the fact,
with the names of those who bored her,
while they vainly imagined they were
giving her an entertainment. We have
no fault to find with her on this account.
It is very well for people to see themselves
as others see them. The motive
of the borer might plead in extenuation of
the offence, in some minds; but Miss
Bremer only knew that she was bored,
and didn't regard the homage to herself,
which it implied, as a sufficient offset.
She was a Sybarite in pursuit of comfort,
and rebelled against being killed with
kindness. Her aim was enjoyment and
not sacrifice. And who shall condemn
her for it? Must one be grateful for an
unsought dinner that inflicts dyspepsia?
The people who entertained Miss Bremer
appear to have been like the good woman
who thought too much couldn't be done
for her minister, when she sweetened his
tea with molasses.</p>

<p>Our countrymen have a theory of their
own about foreign authors, which, we

<!-- vol 2 page 668 col 2 -->

imagine, does not prevail in any other
part of the world. They imagine that the
great aim of all authors is personal attentions,
and not profit to themselves; hence
they receive the most liberal attentions
when they land among us, and are paid
for the delight and the instruction which
their works have afforded us, not in coin
but in compliments. If we read the works
of a foreign author, though he never receives
a penny from us in return, we have
established a claim upon him, which we
would abuse him for resisting, for his
autograph, at least; and a few hours of
his time if we can get it. Many distinguished
authors have visited us, whose
works we have enjoyed scot-free; but
never yet has there been a movement towards
offering a recompense for the benefits
they have conferred upon us, excepting
in the shape of attentions, which, in nine
cases out of ten, have been annoying impertinences.
And we hold up our hands
in horror at the ingratitude of these people
in publishing their candid opinions about
us when they return to their homes. For
our own part, we must say that we have
been struck by the moderation and forbearance
of the whole of them; but especially
so in the instances of Marryatt and
Dickens, who have been so bemauled for
their ingratitude. If they saw the worst
side of our national character, we have
only ourselves to blame for exhibiting it
to them. In the case of Miss Bremer,
there was the double desire to see a literary
lioness, and an amiable anxiety to
render her visit pleasing to herself; and,
since she had shown herself so skilful an
artist in painting the Bears and Generalins
of her own country, who could tell but
she would do the same by the bears and
bores of the New World, it would be worth
while to see one's self mirrored in her
quaint pages. Well, we are all there,
and at once begin to find fault with the
artist; which strikes us as being most
absurdly captious. It would have been
the easiest thing in the world to keep out
of Miss Bremer's book; but we would
rush in. She misspells our names, misquotes
the titles of our books, and makes
an astonishing jumble of our political distinctions
and geographical lines. Something
of this is owing, of course, to the
unfamiliarity of her translator with the
persons mentioned and the scenes described,
and then it is not to be supposed that
the authoress herself was very particular
in making her notes; for, whether it were
Brown or Smith about whom she was
writing, it would be all one to her friends

<!-- vol 2 page 669 col 1 -->

in Stockholm, to whom her letters were
addressed. It is neither a subject of wonder,
nor of much consequence, when Mr.
Wise figures in her pages as Mr. Weise,
Professor Hackley, as "the respectable Mr.
Hackett," when Senator Seward becomes
a native of Boston, and Colonel Benton is
transfigured into a Davy Crockett. There
are a good many people alluded to by
their initials only, who might better have
been designated by the letter X as representing
an unknown person. But, in
nearly every case, Miss Bremer's initial
personages are readily enough recognized
by the circumstances narrated in connection
with them, and our Bully Bottoms
are continually proclaiming themselves
from under the asses' heads which this
Swedish Titania places upon their shoulders.
The "good Marcuses," the "good
Rebeccas," and the "Doctor O.'s," are
well enough known to the readers of Miss
Bremer. One of her novels is called the
"H. Family," so it appears to be a favorite
mode with her of designating people.
No one has a right to be disappointed in
Miss Bremer's New Homes; it is written
in the vein of her other works, gossippy,
tender, quaint, personal, and affectionate.
But, if she were to revisit the United
States, we fear there would be a wide difference
between her second reception and
her first, and even "the good Marcus,"
we doubt, would not be so attentive as he
was before, and "Mrs. L.," whose romantic
marriage Miss Bremer hints at, but,
with singular forbearance, hesitates to
reveal, might not be so anxious to entertain
her at her "Villa on the Hudson."
It was Miss Bremer's mission to note the
oddities and peculiarities of individuals;
it was her doing such things that first endeared
her to us, and made us so anxious
to see the little lady who had given us
such amusing portraits of her own neighbors
and country people. What else
could she do when she visited us? She
came for no other purpose. Such, too,
was the case with Dickens and Marryatt.
We had enjoyed their grotesque pictures
of English society, and threw ourselves in
their way that they might make pictures
of us, and then quarrelled with them for
doing it. It would have been just as
reasonable to find fault with Sir Charles
Lyell, for exposing our geological formations,
as to complain of these authors for
exercising their talent in describing the
different strata of our national character.
It was their vocation to do so, and all we
had to do was to "grin and bear it." Our
wincing only confirmed the truth of their
portraiture. It is not agreeable to one's
feelings to be a subject of ridicule, but, if
we will invite a caricaturist into our

<!-- vol 2 page 669 col 2 -->

houses we must expect to be caricatured.
The little Swedish novelist had come over
to the New World with no very clear
ideas of what she was to see beyond the
Mississippi and Niagara Falls, and was at
once stunned, confused, bewildered, and
overpowered by the profuse attentions of
flocks of admiring strangers who came to
invite her to their houses, to shake her
feeble little hand, to beg her autograph,
to ask what kind of a passage she had,
how she liked the country, or to gaze at
her in open-mouthed wonder. Was it
any wonder that she exclaimed, soon after
landing on our shores, when she heard a
tap at her door. "O! I wish I was a little
dog that I could creep under the table and
hide myself." She stopped to rest one
night, at a town in the western part of
the State, when it was immediately noised
about that she was there, and all the
people crowded to the hotel to catch a
sight of her, to shake her hand, and put
the eternal questions of what kind of a
passage she had, and how she liked the
country. One of the dignitaries of the
town introduced himself to the gentleman
who was travelling with her, and
begged to be introduced to Miss Bremer.
The request was complied with, and then
the gentleman stepped to the door, beckoned
in the crowd of citizens waiting in
the bar-room, and introduced the whole of
them, one by one. Miss Bremer makes
no mention of this circumstance in her
letters, probably because such annoyances
had become so common that she thought
it hardly worth her while to keep repeating
them. Yet, notwithstanding these
things, she every now and then breaks
out with an exclamation, "They are a
beautiful people!" Her account of her
first dinner party in New-York is both
graphic and entertaining, and we hope it
will have its effect on dinner-givers. The
hospitable family who entertained her on
this occasion must read the account of the
impression which their sumptuous festival
left on her mind with very peculiar feelings.
She was not surprised, as she says,
to learn that Irving was in the habit of
sleeping at great dinners.</p>

<p>"Is there in this world anything more
wearisome, more dismal, more intolerable,
more indigestible, more stupefying,
more unbearable, any thing more calculated
to kill both soul and body, than a great
dinner at New-York? For my part, I do
not believe there is. People sit down to
the table at half-past five or six o'clock;
they are sitting at table at nine o'clock,
sitting and being served with the one course
after another, with the one indigestible
dish after another, eating and being silent.
I have never heard such a silence as at these

<!-- vol 2 page 670 col 1 -->

great dinners. In order not to go to sleep,
I am obliged to eat, to eat without being
hungry, and dishes, too, which do not agree
with me. And all the while I feel such an
emotion of impatience and wrath at this
mode of wasting time and God's good gifts,
and that in so stupidly wearisome a manner,
that I am just ready to fling dish and plate
on the floor, and repay hospitality by a
sermon of rebuke, if I only had courage
enough. But I am silent, and suffer, and
grumble, and scold in silence. Not quite
beautiful this; but I cannot help it! I was
yesterday at one of these great dinners&mdash;a
horrible feast! Two elderly gentlemen,
lawyers, sat opposite me, sat and dozed
while they opened their mouths to put in
the delicacies which were offered to them.
At our peasant-weddings, where people
also sit three hours at table, there are,
nevertheless, talk and toasts, and gifts for
the bride and bridegroom, and fiddlers to
play in every dish; but here one has nothing
but the meat. And the dinners in Denmark!
I cannot but think of them, with
their few but excellent dishes, and animated,
cheerful guests, who merely were sometimes
too loud in their zeal for talking, and
making themselves heard; the wit, the
joke, the stories, the toasts, the conversations,
the merry, free, lively <i>laisser alter</i>,
which distinguishes Danish social life; in
truth, it was Champagne&mdash;Champagne for
soul and body at the entertainments
there!&mdash;the last at which I was present in
Europe before I came hither. But these
entertainments here! they are destined to
hell, as Heiberg says, in 'A Soul after
Death,' and they are called '<i>the tiresome</i>.'
And they ought to be introduced into the
Litany. On this occasion, however, Fortune
was kind to me, and placed by my
side the interesting clergyman, Dr. Hawks,
who during dinner explained to me, with
his beautiful voice, and in his lucid and excellent
manner, his ideas regarding the remains
in Central America, and his hypothesis
of the union of the two continents of
America and Asia in a very remote age.
It was interesting to hear him, and interesting
would it be to me to see and hear
more of this man, whose character and
manner attract me. He is also among
those who have invited me to his house and
home, but whose invitation I am obliged to
decline, and in this case I feel that it is a
renunciation and loss.</p>

<p>"As he led me from the dinner-table, I
proposed to him to preach against such
dinners. But he shook his head, and said,
with a smile, 'Not against dinners, Miss
Bremer!' "</p>

<p>This is really and truly a terrific picture
of social discomfort. Here are worthy
people putting themselves to great expense
and trouble for the sake of inflicting
misery on those to whom they have only
the kindest intentions. The "two elderly
gentlemen&mdash;lawyers," were doubtless invited

<!-- vol 2 page 670 col 2 -->

as an especial compliment to the
distinguished foreigner, they were men of
great legal attainments, of high social
position, and great wealth; doubtless they
were the Conversation Kenges of their
neighborhood, and felt that they were
overpowering the little authoress by their
immense dignity, and she, all the while,
was making invidious comparisons between
them and the peasants of her own
country, and thinking of the pleasant
feasts she had been at in Denmark.</p>

<p>To one who delighted in being alone,
who loved even the darkness of the night,
because it left her imagination free&mdash;these
formal parties, where the crowds were
great, the faces strange, and the manners
stiff, the wearisomeness must have been
woful.</p>

<p>"In my early youth, when we were many
in family, and it was difficult to be alone,
I used sometimes to go and lock myself in
that dark little room at Aersta, where
mamma keeps her keys, merely that I
might feel myself alone, because as soon
as I was quite alone in that pitch darkness,
I experienced an extraordinary sensation&mdash;a
sensation as if I had wings, and was
lifted up by them out of my own being,
and that was an unspeakable enjoyment to
me. That half-spiritual, half-bodily feeling
is inexplicable to me; but it always returns
when I am quite alone and altogether un-disturbed
by agitating thoughts, as is the
case at this time. I experience a secret,
wonderful joy as I stand thus alone among
strangers, in the midst of the world's sea,
and feel myself to be free and light as a
bird upon the bough."</p>

<p>But she was happy at the Downings,
at Rose Cottage, with Marcus and Rebecca;
at Elmwood, with the Lowells; and
found contentment and quiet at Concord,
with Emerson, who seems to have worn
a most sphinx-like aspect in her eyes.
Her attempts to find a lodge in some
vast wilderness, where she could be alone
with her thoughts, had a very comical
result, which she narrates with great glee
and simplicity. On her return to the
North, after her visit to Cuba and the
slave States of the South, she went alone
to Harper's Ferry, in the hope of escaping
the wearisome persecutions of attentive
admirers, and there she found an admirer
of a different kind from any she had encountered
before.</p>

<p>"One evening, when somewhat late, I
was returning home over the hills, I saw,
sitting on a stile which I had to pass, a
man in a blue artisan blouse, with his brow
resting on his hand, in which he held a
pocket handkerchief. As I came nearer,
he removed his hand and looked at me,
and I saw an Irish nose in a good lively

<!-- vol 2 page 671 col 1 -->

countenance, which seemed to be that of a
man about thirty years of age.</p>

<p>" 'It's very warm!' said he, speaking
English.</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' said I, passing, 'and you have
worked hard, have you not?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, my hands are quite spoiled!' and
with that he exhibited a pair of coarse,
black hands.</p>

<p>"I asked a little about his circumstances.
He was an Irishman, named Jim, and had
come hither to seek for work, which he had
found at the manufactory, and by which he
could earn twenty dollars a month. But
still, he said, he loved the Old Country
best, and he meant to return to it as soon
as he could get together a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"I inquired if he were married.</p>

<p>"No; he had thought it best to remain
unmarried. And then he inquired if I were
married.</p>

<p>"I replied no; and added that, like him,
I thought it best to remain unmarried, after
which I bade him a friendly good-bye.</p>

<p>"But he rose up, and, following me,
said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'And you are wandering about here
so alone, Miss! Don't you think it is
wearisome to go wandering about by yourself?'</p>

<p>" 'No, Jim,' said I, 'I like to go by myself.'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, but you would feel yourself so
much better off,' said he; 'you would find
yourself so much happier, if you had a
young man to go about with you, and take
care of you?'</p>

<p>" 'But I find myself very well off as I
am, Jim,' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Oh, but you'd find yourself much,
much better off, if you had a young man, I
assure you&mdash;a young man who was fond of
you, and would go with you every where.
It makes the greatest difference in the world
to a lady, I do assure you!'</p>

<p>" 'But, Jim, I am an old lady now, and
a young man would not trouble himself
about me.'</p>

<p>"'You are not too old to be married,
Miss,' said he; 'and then you are good
looking, Miss; you are very good looking,
Ma'am! and a nice young man would be
very glad to have you, to go about every
where with you.'</p>

<p>" 'But, Jim, perhaps he would not like
to go where I should like to go, and then
how should we get on together?'</p>

<p>" 'Oh, yes, he would like, Ma'am, I assure
you he would like it! And perhaps
you have a thousand dollars on which you
would maintain him, Ma'am.'</p>

<p>" 'But, Jim, I should not like to have a
husband who would merely have me for
the sake of my dollars.'</p>

<p>" 'You're right there, Miss, very right.
But you would be so very much happier
with a nice young man who would take
care of you,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>" 'Look here, Jim,' said I, finally; 'up
there, above the clouds, is a great big Gentleman

<!-- vol 2 page 671 col 2 -->

who takes care of me, and if I have
him, there is no need of any one else.'</p>

<p>"The thought struck my warm-hearted
Irishman, who exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'There you are right, Miss! Yes, He
is the husband, after all! And if you have
Him, you need not be afraid of any thing?'</p>

<p>" 'Nor am I afraid, Jim. But now,' said I,
'go ahead, for the path is too narrow for two.'</p>

<p>"And we separated. What now do you
think of your proposed brother-in-law?"</p>

<p>Miss Bremer is an annexationist, as, we
think, all right-judging people are, who look
at the subject uninfluenced by partisan
prejudices. She remained long enough in
Cuba, and saw enough of our own "South,"
to see that annexation would be a blessing
to both parties. She says:</p>

<p>"My secret wish and hope is, that Cuba
may one day, by peaceful means, belong to
the United States. When the United States
shall comprehend within themselves the
regions of the tropics, and shall thence extend
their realm of States, then first will it
become the universal realm which it ought
to be. And Cuba in the hands of the
Anglo-Americans would soon discontinue
the slave-trade; the Gospel would be
preached to the slaves; the fortress walls
of the bohea would be converted into pretty
American slave-villages; and perhaps the
noble-minded laws of Cuba respecting the
slave might be incorporated into the legislative
code of the Union, when Cuba itself
became a part of the Union."</p>

<p>All European travellers in the United
States, while they have expressed their
admiration of the beauty of our women,
have been equally decided in reproaching
us with the ugliness of our men. But
Miss Bremer was struck by the handsome
appearance of the male part of our population.
Some of us are Apollos, some giants,
and all are "handsome." "Women," as
old Peachum says, may be "desperate
bad judges in these cases;" but a compliment
of this kind from a lady is certainly
of sufficient weight to balance the opinions
of a dozen Englishmen, who are interested
parties. What gives the greater
value to Miss Bremer's opinions in this
respect is the evident gusto with which
she describes the good-looking men she
came in contact with. Speaking of the
slaves in the slave market at New Orleans,
she remarks: "I observed among the
men some really athletic figures, with
good countenances and remarkably good
foreheads; there was one negro in particular&mdash;his
price was two thousand dollars&mdash;to
whom I took a great fancy." She
describes one of the slave dealers as "a
man of unusual size, and singularly handsome.
His figure was Herculean, and he
had the features of a Jupiter." This is
not the kind of image which English artists

<!-- vol 2 page 672 col 1 -->

make when they attempt to depict a
Yankee slave trader; but Miss Bremer,
who has a passion for portraits, makes
her drawings from the life school.</p>

<p>Many querulous remarks have been
made by our contemporaries of the Press,
about the imprudences of Miss Bremer, in
her revelations of domestic society, but
her amiability and overflowing love for
every body with whom she came in contact,
should be considered as a sufficient
apology for her unreserve. As to the
other complaint that she elevates into importance
personages whom we had never
before heard of, and makes heroes and
heroines of quiet people who had never
been suspected of heroic qualities by their
acquaintances, it does not strike us as a
very serious offence; if she sees a park in
a little inclosure of two or three city lots,
shadowed by one or two ailanthus trees,
it does not follow that her other descriptions
were all in her eye, for she seems to
have been fully impressed by the grandeur
of our river scenery, and she has
given some very graphic sketches of the
rural districts, both of the East and the
West. It is inevitable that travellers
should make mistakes in their description
of foreign countries; but, when, as in
the case of Miss Bremer, they are all in
favor of the country visited, the people
whom she describes should be the last to
complain. We do not believe that her
book will have a tendency to make us less
respected in Europe, that it will cause

<!-- vol 2 page 672 col 2 -->

Americans to be received with diminished
consideration abroad, or that it will cause
a single Scandinavian to change his purpose
of emigrating with his family and
household gods to the wilderness of the
New World. From various little asides
in her letters we are led to believe that
Miss Bremer is not indifferent to the pleasures
of the table, and she seems to have
been most favorably impressed with the
American <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, except in the case of
the hot breakfasts in winter, which appeared
to her as contrasting too violently
with the cold bedrooms. But the only
purely American dish which she speaks
of with enthusiasm is gumbo, a delicacy
that can be eaten in perfection only in
New Orleans. Of this delicious production
of the creole cuisine of Louisiana, she
says: "Gumbo is the crown of all the
savory and remarkable soups in the
world&mdash;a regular elixir of life of the substantial
kind. He who has once eaten
gumbo may look down disdainfully upon
the most genuine turtle soup."</p>

<p>We fully "indorse" the eulogium of
Miss Bremer on the gumbo of New Orleans.
Nearly every thing American with
which she becomes acquainted receives as
warm and genial an approbation, and we
would recommend all American readers
of her book to bear in mind the generous
sentiment of Sir Lucius O'Trigger. "When
affection guides the pen he must be a
brute who would find fault with the
style."</p>

<h3>LITERARY PIRACY.</h3>

</div>

<p class="small"><i>Letters on International Copy-right</i>. By H. C.
CAREY, author of "Principles of Political Economy,"
&amp;c. Philadelphia: A. Hart. 1853.</p>

<p>WE have at last a formal, if not formidable
treatise on anti-copy-right, by
a writer who treats the subject in a candid
and gentlemanly manner, and who,
though he argues scientifically in favor of
robbery, does it on philosophical principles,
and in a benevolent spirit, and not in that
sordid tone which has distinguished all
the arguments that we have hitherto heard
from the opponents of international copy-right.
The difference between Mr. Carey
and the other gentlemen whose cause he
espouses is, that while they seem to have
been influenced by no better motive than
that of personal aggrandizement, he is
apparently a disinterested believer in the
benevolence and justice of the measure
which he advocates. He is, therefore, all
the more dangerous, as an opponent, and
the more entitled to consideration. Mr.
Carey is a retired publisher, and the
author of some remarkable essays on
political economy; he is the antagonist of
the Ricardo school of political philosophers,
an advocate of high protective duties,
and a fluent and forcible writer. We are
very glad to meet him as an antagonist on
the subject of copy-right, for he can make
the most of his subject, and we are quite
sure that no other writer will present it
in a stronger light, or more happily illustrate
his theory by the extent and variety
of the facts which he has brought to bear
upon the question. His pamphlet appears
at a most opportune moment, too, when
the subject of international copy-right has
assumed an importance which it has never
had before, from the circumstance of the
administration having declared itself in
favor of a total abolition of the small duty
now imposed on printed books. Mr. Carey
could hardly have had such an event in
his mind, or the anticipation of it, and
its too probable influence upon the interests
of our native literature, or he
would never have raised his voice, we imagine,
on the side of the anti-copy-right
advocates. The great bugbear in the eyes
of Mr. Carey is centralization, and the
fatal facility which a reduction of duties
on printed books, even with the counteracting
effect which an international copy-right
law would exert, in making London
the metropolis of the United States, must

<!-- vol 3 page 96 col 2 -->

be plain enough to so shrewd a thinker as
Mr. Carey. He endeavors to prove, and
we think successfully, that the union of
Scotland and Ireland with England has
destroyed the national literature of those
two countries, and transferred the producing
power in literature which once manifested
itself so strongly in Dublin and
Edinburgh, to London.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Seventy years after the date of the Union, Edinburgh
was still a great literary capital, and could then
offer to the world the names of numerous men, of
whose reputation any country of the world might
have been proud: Burns and McPherson; Robertson
and Hume; Blair and Kames; Reid, Smith, and
Stewart; Monboddo, Playfair, and Boswell; and numerous
others, whose reputation has survived to the
present day. Thirty-five years later, its press furnished
the world with the works of Jeffrey and
Brougham; Stewart, Brown, and Chalmers; Scott,
Wilson, and Joanna Baillie; and with those of many
others whose reputation was less widely spread, among
whom were Galt, Hogg, Lockhart, and Miss Ferrier,
the authoress of <i>Marriage</i>. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
and <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> then, to a great extent,
represented Scottish men and Scottish modes of
thought. Looking now on the same field of action,
it is difficult, from this distance, to discover more than
two Scottish authors, Alison and Sir William Hamilton,
the latter all 'the more conspicuous and remarkable,
as he now,' says the <i>North British Review</i> (Feb.
1853), 'stands so nearly alone in the ebb of literary
activity in Scotland, which has been so apparent during
this generation.' McCulloch and Macaulay were
both, I believe, born in Scotland, but in all else they
are English. Glasgow has recently presented the
world with a new poet, in the person of Alexander
Smith, but, unlike Ramsay and Burns, there is nothing
Scottish about him beyond his place of birth. 'It is
not,' says one of his reviewers, 'Scottish scenery,
Scottish history, Scottish character, and Scottish social
humor, that he represents or depicts. Nor is there,'
it continues, 'any trace in him of that feeling of intense
nationality so common in Scottish writers.
London,' as it adds, 'a green lane in Kent, an English
forest, an English manor-house, there are the scenes
where the real business of the drama is transacted.'*</p>

<p>[*North British Review, Aug. 1853.]</p>

<p>"The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> has become to all intents
and purposes an English journal, and <i>Blackwood</i> has
lost all those characteristics by which it was in former
times distinguished from the magazines published
south of the Tweed.</p>

<p>"Seeing these facts, we can scarcely fail to agree
with the review already quoted, in the admission
that there are 'probably fewer leading individual
thinkers and literary guides in Scotland at present,
than at any other period of its history since the early
part of the last century,' since the day when Scotland
itself lost its individuality. The same journal informs
us that 'there is now scarcely an instance of a Scotchman
holding a learned position in any other country,'
and farther says, that 'the small number of names of
literary Scotchmen known throughout Europe for
eminence in literature and science is of itself sufficient

<!-- vol 3 page 97 col 1 -->

to show to how great an extent the present race of
Scotchmen have lost the position which their ancestors
held in the world of letters."*............</p>

<p>[*North British Review, May, 1853.]</p>

<p>"The London <i>Leader</i> tells its readers that "England
is a power made up of conquests over nationalities;'
and it is right. The nationality of Scotland
has disappeared; and, however much it may annoy
our Scottish friends&dagger; to have the energetic Celt sunk
in the 'slow and unimpressible' Saxon, such is the
tendency of English centralization, every where destructive
of that national feeling which is essential to
progress in civilization.</p>

<p>[&dagger;See Blackwood's Magazine, Sept. 1853, art. "Scotland since the Union."]</p>

<p>"If we look to Ireland, we find a similar state of
things. Seventy years since, that country was able
to insist upon and to establish its claim for an independent
government, and, by aid of the measures
then adopted, was rapidly advancing. From that
period to the close of the century, the demand for
books for Ireland was so great as to warrant the re-publication
of a large portion of those produced in
England. The <i>kingdom</i> of Ireland of that day gave
to the world such men as Burke and Grattan, Moore
and Edgeworth, Curran, Sheridan, and Wellington.
Centralization, however, demanded that Ireland
should become a province of England, and from that
time famines and pestilences have been of frequent
occurrence, and the whole population is now being
expelled to make room for the 'slow and unimpressible'
Saxon race. Under these circumstances, it is
matter of small surprise that Ireland not only produces
no books, but that she furnishes no market for
those produced by others. Half a century of international
copy-right has almost annihilated both the
producers and the consumers of books.</p>

<p>"Passing towards England, we may for a moment
look to Wales, and then, if we desire to find the
effects of centralization and its consequent absenteeism,
in neglected schools, ignorant teachers, decaying
and decayed churches, and drunken clergymen with
immoral flocks, our object will be accomplished by
studying the pages of the <i>Edinburgh Review</I>.&Dagger; In
such a state of things as is there described there can
be little tendency to the development of intellect, and
little of either ability or inclination to reward the
authors of books. In my next, I will look to England
herself."</p>

<p>[&Dagger;April, 1853, art. "The Church in the Mountains."]</p>

</div>

<p>Precisely such an effect as has been produced
in Dublin and Edinburgh Mr.
Carey predicts for this country, in the
event of the passage of an international
copy-right law which shall give to Englishmen
the right to control their publications
in this country; an opinion in which we
wholly differ from him; but his argument
becomes fearfully powerful, and the state
of things he anticipates, an absolute certainty
in the absence of all duties and all
copy-right. Nothing can save the literary
interests of this country, and all the national
interests connected with them, from
utter destruction, but the passage of an
international copy-right law, if the duties
are to be abolished on foreign books, and
there seems but little doubt that such will
be the case. We may then give ourselves
up as literary dependents, and fall into the
ranks with Edinburgh and Dublin, and

<!-- vol 3 page 97 col 2 -->

acknowledge Paternoster Row to be our
common intellectual centre. England now
furnishes the greater part of our mental
food, and it will then furnish the whole,
excepting such as can be gathered from
the daily newspaper.</p>

<p>But Mr. Carey is so entirely mastered by
his idea of centralization, and sees so clearly
the whole world whirling in a maelstrom
with London for its centre, that he can hardly
see in any of the movements of social
policy any thing else. This idea neutralizes
itself by making itself self-destructive,
not only does it swallow up all its surroundings,
but it swallows itself. Mr.
Carey proves that centralization is as destructive
to its own centre as to the objects
within its influence.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Centralization enables Mr. Dickens to obtain vast
sums by advertising the works of the poor authors by
whom he is surrounded, most of whom are not only
badly paid, but insolently treated, while even of those
whose names and whose works are well known abroad
many gladly become recipients of the public charity.
In the zenith of her reputation, Lady Charlotte Bury
received, as I am informed, but &pound;200 ($960) for the
absolute copy-right of works that sold for $7 50.
Lady Blessington, celebrated as she was, had but
from three to four hundred pounds; and neither Marryat
nor Bulwer ever received, as I believe, the selling
price of a thousand copies of their books as compensation
for the copy-right.&sect; Such being the facts
in regard to well-known authors, some idea may be
formed in relation to the compensation of those who
are obscure. The whole tendency of the 'cheap
labor' system, so generally approved by English
writers, is to destroy the value of literary labor by increasing
the number of persons who <i>must</i> look to the
pen for the means of support, and by diminishing the
market for its products. What has been the effect of
the system will now be shown by placing before you
a list of the names of all the existing British authors
whose reputation can be regarded as of any wide extent,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="small">

<tr><td>Tennyson,</td><td>Thackeray,</td><td>Grote,</td><td>McCulloch,</td></tr>

<tr><td>Carlyle,</td><td>Bulwer,</td><td>Macaulay,</td><td>Hamilton,</td></tr>

<tr><td>Dickens,</td><td>Alison,</td><td>J. S. Mill,</td><td>Farraday.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>[&sect;This I had from Capt. Marryat himself.]</p>

<p>"This list is very small as compared with that presented
in the same field five-and-thirty years since,
and its difference in weight is still greater in number.
Scott, the novelist and poet, may certainly be regarded
as the counterpoise of much more than any one of
the writers of fiction in this list. Byron, Moore,
Rogers, and Campbell enjoyed a degree of reputation
far exceeding that of Tennyson. Wellington, the historian
of his own campaigns, would much outweigh
any of the historians. Malthus and Ricardo were
founders of a school that has greatly influenced the
policy of the world, whereas McCulloch and Mill are
but disciples in that school. Dalton, Davy, and Wollaston
will probably occupy a larger space in the history
of science than Sir Michael Farraday, large even
as may be that assigned to him.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary as is the existence of such a state of
things in a country claiming so much to abound in
wealth, it is yet more extraordinary that we look
around in vain to see who are to replace even these

<!-- vol 3 page 98 col 1 -->

when age or death shall withdraw them from the
literary world. Of all here named, Mr. Thackeray is
the only one that has risen to reputation in the last
ten years, and he is no longer young; and even he
seeks abroad that reward for his efforts which is
denied to him by the 'cheap labor' system at
home. Of the others, nearly, if not quite all, have
been for thirty years before the world, and, in the
natural course of things, some of them must disappear
from the stage of authorship, if not of life.
If we seek their successors among the writers for
the weekly or monthly journals, we shall certainly
fail to find them. Looking to the Reviews, we find
ourselves forced to agree with the English journalist
who informs his readers that 'it is said, and with
apparent justice, that the quarterlies are not as good as
they were.' From year to year they have less the
appearance of being the production of men who
looked to any thing beyond mere pecuniary compensation
for their labor. In reading them, we find
ourselves compelled to agree with the reviewer,
who regrets to see that the centralization which is
hastening the decline of the Scottish universities is
tending to cause the mind of the whole youth of
Scotland to be</p>

<p>" 'Cast in the mould of English universities, institutions
which, from their very completeness, exercise
on second-rate minds an influence unfavorable
to originality and power of thought.'&mdash;<i>North British
Review</i>, May 1853.</p>

"Their pupils are, as he says, 'struck with one
mental die,' than which nothing can be less favorable
to literary or scientific development."</p>

</div>

<p>Like most men who ride a hobby Mr.
Carey makes his nag centralization carry
too heavy a load, and it breaks down under
the weight of argument he imposes
upon it. Where there is free intercourse
between nations, centralization becomes a
necessity, and, not only a necessity, but a
blessing; there is but one way to prevent
it, and that is by non-intercourse. The
centralizing influences of England, which
are felt so balefully all over India, have not
yet been perceived by the Japanese; but
the time is near at hand when they too
will begin to understand that they are in
the circle of a maelstrom of which Jeddo
is not the centre. It remains for us
United Statesers to determine whether
this great absorbing centre shall be on
this side of the Atlantic or the other, whether
it shall be London, Paris, New-York,
St. Louis or San Francisco. At present it
is divided between London and Paris.
London is the intellectual and financial
centre, and Paris is the centre of art and
fashion. There is no reason why New-York,
or some other American city, should
not become the great centre of finance,
fashion, literature and art, but a good
many why it should. And, in fact, such
a destiny can only be delayed, and not
prevented by unwise legislation. The
superiority of mind over matter will hardly
be questioned, and wherever the mind
of the world centres itself, there all the
material interests are sure to follow. We

<!-- vol 3 page 98 col 2 -->

have, thus far, in spite of our splendid
opportunities, prevented the United States
from becoming the intellectual centre of
the universe, by perversely violating the
great law of national and individual prosperity,
which gives to every producer the
right to control the productions of his own
labor. We deny to the foreigner the right
of property on our own soil, in his intellectual
productions, whereby we inflict as
great an injury on our own literary producers,
as we should upon our manufacturers
of calicoes, if we permitted an indiscriminate
robbery of foreign manufactured
goods of the same kind. The cases
are precisely analogous. But, hitherto the
full effects of this evil have not been felt,
because the duty on foreign books has, to
a certain extent, though a very limited
one, acted as a protection to the native
literary producer. But this small protection
is now about to be destroyed, and
the ruin of the literary interests of the
nation must inevitably follow unless we
have the counteracting effects of copy-right
to foreigners.</p>

<p>Mr. Carey very consistently attacks the
principle of copy-right in all its bearings:
he not only argues against international
copy-right, but all copy-right; and if some
of his arguments are not very forcible,
we are bound to concede to them the
merit of great originality. We must also
give him the praise of discarding that
mean and despicable argument against
copy-right, which many of its opponents
have so industriously exploited, that acting
justly would prove too costly. These
sentiments are most creditable to Mr.
Carey, although we regret to notice that
he insensibly falls into the line of argument
which he denounces in another part of
his book.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Evil may not be done that good may come of it, nor
may we steal an author's brains that our people may he
cheaply taught. To admit that the end justifies the
means, would be to adopt the line of argument so often
used by English speakers, in and out of Parliament,
when they defend the poisoning of the Chinese people
by means of opium introduced in defiance of their
government, because it furnishes revenue to India; or
that which teaches that Canada should be retained as a
British colony, because of the facility it affords for
the violation of our laws; or that which would have
us regard smugglers, in general, as the great reformers
of the age. We stand in need of no such morality
as this. We can afford to pay for what we want; but,
even were it otherwise, our motto here, and every
where, should be the old French one: "<i>Fais ce que
doy, advienne que pourra</i>"&mdash;Act justly, and leave
the result to Providence. Before acting, however, we
should determine on which side justice lies. Unless
I am greatly in error, it is not on the side of international
copy-right."</p>

</div>

Mr. Carey states his argument against

<!-- vol 3 page 99 col 1 -->

copy-right after the following fashion,
which is not original with him, except in
the manner of expressing it.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"For what then is copy-right given? For the
clothing in which the body is produced to the world.
Examine Mr. Macaulay's <i>History of England</i>, and
you will find that the body is composed of what is
common property. Not only have the facts been recorded
by others, but the ideas, too, are derived from
the works of men who have labored for the world without
receiving, and frequently without the expectation
of receiving, any pecuniary compensation for their
labors. Mr. Macaulay has read much and carefully,
and he has thus been enabled to acquire great skill in
arranging and clothing his facts; but the readers of
his books will find in them no contribution to positive
knowledge. The works of men who make contributions
of that kind are necessarily controversial and distasteful
to the reader; for which reason they find few
readers, and never pay their authors. Turn, now, to
our own authors, Prescott and Bancroft, who have
furnished us with historical works of so great excellence,
and you will find a state of things precisely similar.
They have taken a large quantity of materials
out of the common stock, in which you, and I, and
all of us have an interest; and those materials they
have so reclothed as to render them attractive of purchasers;
but this is all they have done. Look to Mr.
Webster's works, and you will find it the same. He
was a great reader. He studied the Constitution carefully,
with a view to understand what were the
views of its authors, and those views he reproduced
in a different and more attractive clothing, and there
his work ended. He never pretended, as I think, to
furnish the world with any new ideas; and, if he had
done so, he could have claimed no property in them.
Few now read the heavy volumes containing the
speeches of Fox and Pitt. They did nothing but reproduce
ideas that were common property, in such
clothing as answered the purposes of the moment.
Sir Robert Peel did the same. The world would now
be just as wise had he never lived, for he made no
contribution to the general stock of knowledge. The
great work of Chancellor Kent is, to use the words of
Judge Story, but a new combination and arrangement
of old materials, in which the skill and judgment
of the author in the selection and exposition,
and accurate use of the materials, constitute the basis
of his reputation, as well as of his copy-right. The
world at large is the owner of all the facts that have
been collected, and of all the ideas that have been deduced
from them, and its right in them is precisely
the same that the planter has in the bale of cotton
that has been raised on his plantation; and the course
of proceeding of both has, thus far, been precisely
similar; whence I am induced to infer that, in both
cases, right has been done. When the planter hands
his cotton to the spinner and the weaver, he does not
say, 'Take this and convert it into cloth, and keep
the cloth;' but he does say, 'Spin and weave this
cotton, and for so doing you shall have such interest
in the cloth as will give you a fair compensation for
your labor and skill, but, when that shall have been
paid, <i>the cloth will be mine</i>.' This latter is precisely
what society, the owner of facts and ideas, says to the
author: 'Take these raw materials that have been
collected, put them together, and clothe them after
your own fashion, and for a given time we will agree
that nobody else shall present them in the same dress.
During that time you may exhibit them for your
own profit, but at the end of that period the clothing
will become common property, as the body now is.
It is to the contributions of your predecessors to our

<!-- vol 3 page 99 col 2 -->

common stock that you are indebted for the power to
make your book, and we require you, in your turn, to
contribute towards the augmentation of the stock
that is to be used by your successors.' This is justice,
and to grant more than this would be injustice.</p>

<p>"Let us turn now, for a moment, to the producers
of works of fiction. Sir Walter Scott had carefully
studied Scottish and border history, and thus had
filled his mind with facts preserved, and ideas produced
by others, which he reproduced in a different
form. He made no contribution to knowledge. So,
too, with our own very successful Washington Irving.
He drew largely upon the common stock of ideas,
and dressed them up in a new, and what has proved
to be a most attractive form. So, again, with Mr.
Dickens. Read his <i>Bleak House</i>, and you will find
that he has been a most careful observer of men and
things, and has thereby been enabled to collect a great
number of facts that he has dressed up in different
forms, but that is all he has done. He is in the condition
of a man who had entered a large garden, and
collected a variety of the most beautiful flowers growing
therein, of which he had made a fine bouquet.
The owner of the garden would naturally say to him:
'The flowers are mine, but the arrangement is yours.
You cannot keep the bouquet, but you may smell it
or show it for your own profit, for an hour or two,
but then it must come to me. If you prefer it, I am
willing to pay you for your services, giving you a fair
compensation for your time and taste.' This is exactly
what society says to Mr. Dickens, who makes
such beautiful literary bouquets. What is right in
the individual, cannot be wrong in the mass of individuals
of which society is composed. Nevertheless,
the author objects to this, insisting that he is owner
of the bouquet itself, although he has paid no wages to
the man who raised the flowers. Were he asked to
do so, he would, as I will show in another letter, regard
it as leading to great injustice."</p>

</div>

<p>The error of Mr. Carey is in supposing
that the copy-right is granted for the ideas
and facts contained in a book, instead of
the "clothing," as he calls it, in which
they are embodied. No book contains
any thing essential to the welfare of mankind,
which any man may not use for his
own benefit. Any body may collate every
essential fact contained in "Bancroft's
History" or "Kent's Commentaries,"
make a book of them, using his own style
of expression, and obtain a copy-right for
them. The author of a book enjoys no
monopoly, such as the owner of a field
of wheat does; every body may use it,
profit by it, improve upon it, and reproduce
it in another shape in spite of him.
But the owner of the wheat retains for
ever and to all time, absolute control and
monopoly over his property. Mr. Carey
says that the authors of books do nothing
more than make use of ideas which are
the common property of mankind, and
therefore they are not entitled to ownership
in the form in which they present
them to the world. But, it is the form
only which they claim the right of property
in, and, unless that right be granted
to them, the ideas themselves, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 100 col 1 -->

facts of history will never be collected together
in a manner available to the world.
If you kill the goose, it will lay no more
golden eggs; and, if you take from the
author the means of living by his labor,
his labor must cease, and the tribe of
authors must become extinct.</p>

<p>Another of Mr. Carey's arguments
against the right of an author to his own
productions is, we believe, original with
himself; at least we have never seen it
urged in the copy-right controversy. Because
Leibnitz, Descartes, Newton, Humboldt,
and Bowditch were not enriched
by their beneficent scientific labors, he
would deny the right of such triflers as
Irving, Dickens, Scott, and Cooper to the
remuneration for their writings which the
world has been so happy to make them
in return for the pleasure which they have
afforded. Mr. Carey insists that the
agriculturist shall not be paid for his
pears and pomegranates, because another
agriculturist has failed to make a fortune
out of a potato-field. The force of this
reasoning we have not been able to appreciate.
But, Mr. Carey shall himself state
his own case:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"The whole tendency of the existing system is to
give the largest reward to those whose labors are
lightest, and the smallest to those whose labors are
most severe; and every extension of it must necessarily
look in that direction. The <i>Mysteries of Paris</i>
were a fortune to Eugene Sue, and Uncle Tom's
Cabin has been one to Mrs. Stowe. Byron had 2,000
guineas for a volume of <i>Childe Harold</i>, and Moore
3,000 for his <i>Lalla Bookh</i>; and yet a single year
should have more than sufficed for the production of
any one of them. Under a system of international
copy-right, Dumas, already so largely paid, would be
protected, whereas Thierry, who sacrificed his sight
to the gratification of his thirst for knowledge, would
not. Humboldt, the philosopher <i>par excellence</i> of
the age, would not, because he furnishes his readers
with things, and not with words alone. Of the books
that record his observations on this continent, but a
part has, I believe, been translated into English, and
of these but a small portion has been published in this
country, although to be had without claim for copy-right.
In England their sale has been small, and can
have done little more than pay the cost of translation
and publication. Had it been required to pay for
the privilege of translation, but a small part of even
those which have been translated would probably
have ever seen the light in any but the language of
the author. This great man inherited a handsome
property, which he devoted to the advancement of
science, and what has been his pecuniary reward
may be seen in the following statement, derived from
an address recently delivered in New-York:&mdash;</p>


<p>" 'There are now living in Europe two very distinguished
men, barons, both very eminent in their
line, both known to the whole civilized world; one
is Baron Rothschild, and the other Baron Humboldt;
one distinguished for the accumulation of wealth, the
other for the accumulation of knowledge. What are
the possessions of the philosopher? Why, sir, I heard
a gentleman whom I have seen here this afternoon,
say that, on a recent visit to Europe, he paid his respects

<!-- vol 3 page 100 col 2 -->

to that distinguished philosopher, and was admitted
to an audience. He found him, at the age of
84 years, fresh and vigorous, in a small room, nicely
sanded, with a large deal table uncovered in the
midst of that room, containing his books and waiting
apparatus. Adjoining this, was a small bed-room, in
which he slept. Here this eminent philosopher received
a visitor from the United States. He conversed
with him; he spoke of his works. 'My works,'
said he, 'you will find in the adjoining library, but I
am too poor to own a copy of them. I have not the
means to buy a full copy of my own works.'</p>

<p>"After having furnished to the gentlemen who produce
books more of the material of which books are
composed than has ever been furnished by any other
man, this illustrious man finds himself, at the close of
life, altogether dependent on the bounty of the Prussian
government, which allows him, as I heard, less
than five hundred dollars a year. In what manner,
now, would Humboldt be benefited by international
copy-right? I know of none; but it is very plain to
see that Dumas, Victor Hugo, and George Sand,
might derive from it a large revenue. In confirmation
of this view, I would ask you to review the
names of the persons who urge most anxiously the
change of system that is now proposed, and see if you
can find in it the name of a single man who has done
any thing to extend the domain of knowledge. I think
you will not. Next look, and see if you do not find in
it the names of those who furnish the world with new
forms of old ideas, and are largely paid for so doing.
The most active advocate of international copy-right
is Mr. Dickens, who is said to realize $50,000 per
annum for the sale of works whose composition is
little more than amusement for his leisure hours.
In this country, the only attempt that has yet been
made to restrict the right of translation is in a suit
now before the courts, for compensation for the
privilege of converting into German a work that has
yielded the largest compensation that the world has
yet known for the same quantity of literary labor.</p>

<p>"We are constantly told that regard to the interests
of science requires that we should protect and enlarge
the rights of authors; but does science make any
such claim for herself? I doubt it. Men who make
additions to science know well that they have, and
can have, no rights whatever. Cuvier died very
poor, and all the copy-right that could have been
given to him or Humboldt would not have enriched
either of them. Laplace knew well that his great
work could yield him nothing. Our own Bowditch
translated it as a labor of love, and left by his will
the means required for its publication. The gentlemen
who advocate the interests of science are literary
men, who use the facts and ideas furnished by scientific
men, paying nothing for their use. Now, literature
is a most honorable profession, and the gentlemen
engaged in it are entitled not only to the respect and
consideration of their fellow-men, but also to the
protection of the law; but in granting it, the legislator
is bound to recollect, that justice to the men who
furnish the raw materials of the books, and justice to
the community that owns those raw materials, require
that protection shall not, either in point of space
or time, be greater than is required for giving the
producer of books a full and fair compensation for
his labor."</p>

</div>

<p>We may as well remark, <i>en passant</i>,
that the absurd story about Humboldt is
all trash; his works intended for popular
reading have been very popular, and he
has reaped great profits from them, and
he is about the most independent author

<!-- vol 3 page 101 col 1 -->

in existence, so far as his pecuniary circumstances
are concerned.</p>

<p>The argument of Mr. Carey against
international copy-right is not very clearly
stated, but the fear of centralization
is the pervading thought in his mind
while discussing the subject. He contends
that:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"England is fast becoming one great shop, and
traders have, in general, neither time nor disposition
to cultivate literature. The little proprietors disappear,
and the day laborers who succeed them can
neither educate their children nor purchase books.
The great proprietor is an absentee, and he has little
time for either literature or science. From year to
year the population of the kingdom becomes more
and more divided into two great classes; the very
poor, with whom food and raiment require all the
proceeds of labor, and the very rich who prosper by
the cheap labor system, and therefore eschew the
study of principles. With the one class, books are
an unattainable luxury, while with the other the
absence of leisure prevents the growth of desire to
purchase them. The sale is, therefore, small; and
hence it is that authors are badly paid. In strong
contrast with the limited sale of English books at
home, is the great extent of sale here, as shown in the
following facts: Of the octavo edition of the Modern
British Essayists, there have been sold in five years
no less than 80,000 volumes. Of Macaulay's Miscellanies,
3 vols. 12mo., the sale has amounted to 60,000
volumes. Of Miss Aguilar's writings, the sale, in two
years, has been 100,000 volumes. Of Murray's
Encyclopedia of Geography, more than 50,000 volumes
have been sold, and of McCulloch's Commercial
Dictionary, 10,000 volumes. Of Alexander Smith's
Poems, the sale, in a few months, has reached 10,000
copies. The sales of Mr. Thackeray's works has
been quadruple that of England, and that of the works
of Mr. Dickens counts almost by millions of volumes.
Of Bleak House, in all its various forms&mdash;in newspapers,
magazines, and volumes&mdash;it has already
amounted to several hundred thousands of copies.
Of Bulwer's last novel, since it was completed, the
sale has, I am told, exceeded 35,000. Of Thiers's
French Revolution and Consulate, there have been
sold 32,000, and of Montagu's edition of Lord Bacon's
works 4,000 copies.</p>

<p>"If the sales of books were as great in England as
they are here, English authors would be abundantly
paid. In reply it will be said their works are cheap
here because we pay no copy-right. For the payment
of the authors, however, a very small sum
would be required, if the whole people of England
could afford, as they should be able to do, to purchase
books. A contribution of a shilling per head would
give, as has been shown, a sum of almost eight millions
of dollars, sufficient to pay to fifteen hundred salaries
nearly equal to those of our secretaries of State.
Centralization, however, destroys the market for
books, and the sale is, therefore, small; and the few
successful writers owe their fortunes to the collection
of large contributions made among a small number
of readers; while the mass of authors live on, as did
poor Tom Hood, from day to day, with scarcely a
hope of improvement in their condition."</p>

</div>

<p>And, therefore, because England does
not sufficiently reward her authors, and
because we read their books more than

<!-- vol 3 page 101 col 2 -->

their own countrymen do, are we absolved
from all necessity of paying them for the
use of their property. This is the extent of
Mr. Carey's argument, so far as we have
been able to master it.</p>

<p>We regret very much that he leaves
the Prince of Denmark out of his play of
Hamlet; for, after all, the main question
is untouched in his letters, and that aspect
of the subject which bears the most
important feature for us, he does not
present to us. What is the legitimate
effect of the competition now waged between
our own authors, and the unpaid
authors of Europe? If the "cheap labor"
of England has such a deadly influence
upon our manufacturing prosperity as
Mr. Carey contends, what must be the
effects of the unpaid labor with which our
literary men are brought in direct competition?
They are well known; and
Mr. Carey himself exhibits them in a very
startling manner in the statistics he furnishes
of the republication in this country
of foreign books, all of which might as
well have been produced here. But, the
great evil of our being dependent, and
mental vassals of England, is not so much
that it transfers the labor market from
this country to Europe, and confers the
reputation upon foreigners which our own
people might enjoy; but it places the
whole mind of the nation at the mercy of
foreigners, and permeates the mental constitution
of our people, with thoughts,
sentiments, ideas, and aspirations foreign
to our true interests and detrimental to
the growth and expansion of American
ideas and democratic sympathies. No
better argument could be brought forward
to sustain the claims of international
copy-right than the formidable display
which Mr. Carey makes of the statistics
of original publications in this country,
intended by him to serve as a proof that
no protection is needed by our authors.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Every body <i>must</i> learn to read and write, and
every body <i>must</i> therefore have books; and to this
universality of demand it is due that the sale of those
required for early education is so immense. Of the
works of Peter Parley it counts by millions; but if
we take his three historical books (price 75 cents each)
alone, we find that it amounts to between half a million
and a million of volumes. Of Goodrich's United
States it has been a quarter of a million. Of Morse's
Geography and Atlas (50 cents) the sale is said to be
no less than 70,000 per annum. Of Abbot's histories,
the sale is said to have already been more than
400,000, while of Emerson's Arithmetic and Reader it
counts almost by millions. Of Mitchell's several
geographies it is 400,000 a year.</p>

<p>"In other branches of education the same state of
things is seen to exist. Of the Boston Academy's
Collection of Sacred Music, the sale has exceeded
600,000, and the aggregate sale of five books by the

<!-- vol 3 page 102 col 1 -->

same author has probably exceeded a million, and the
price of these is a dollar per volume.</p>

<p>"All these make, of course, demand for books, and
hence it is that the sale of Anthon's series of classics
(averaging $1) amounts, as I am told, to certainly not
less than 50,000 volumes per annum, while of the
<i>Classical Dictionary</i> of the same author ($4) not
less than 30,000 have been sold. Of Liddell and
Scott's <i>Greek Lexicon</i> ($5,) edited by Prof. Drisler,
the sale has been not less than 25,000, and probably
much larger. Of Webster's 4to. <i>Dictionary</i> ($6) it
has been, I am assured, 60,000, and perhaps even
80,000; and of the royal 8vo. one ($3 50), 250,000. Of
Bolmar's French school books not less than 150,000
volumes have been sold. The number of books used
in the higher schools&mdash;text-books in philosophy,
chemistry, and other branches of science, is exceedingly
great, and it would be easy to produce numbers
of which the sale is from five to ten thousand per
annum; but to do so would occupy too much space,
and I must content myself with the few facts already
given in regard to this department of literature." . .</p>

<p>"Of all American authors, those of school-books
excepted, there is no one of whose books so many
have been circulated as those of Mr. Irving. Prior to
the publication of the edition recently issued by Mr.
Putnam, the sale had amounted to some hundreds of
thousands; and yet of that edition, selling at $1 25
per volume, it has already amounted to 144,000 vols.
Of <i>Uncle Tom</i>, the sale has amounted to 295,000 copies,
partly in one, and partly in two volumes, and the
total number of volumes amounts probably to about
450,000.</p>

<p>"Next to Chancellor Kent's work comes Greenleaf
on Evidence, 3 vols., $16 50; the sale of which has
been exceedingly great, but what has been its extent,
I cannot say.</p>

<p>"Of Blatchford's General Statutes of New-York, a
local work, price $4 50, the sale has been 3,000; equal
to almost 30,000 of a similar Work for the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>"How great is the sale of Judge Story's books can
be judged only from the fact that the copy-right now
yields, and for years past has yielded, more than
$8,000 per annum. Of the sale of Mr. Prescott's
works little is certainly known, but it cannot, I understand,
have been less than 160,000 volumes. That
of Mr. Bancroft's History has already risen, certainly,
to 30,000 copies, and I am told it is considerably more;
and yet even that is a sale, for such a work, entirely
unprecedented.</p>

<p>"Of the works of Hawthorne, Longfellow, Bryant,
Willis, Curtis, Sedgwick, and numerous others, the
sale is exceedingly great; but, as not even an approximation
to the true amount can be offered, I must leave
it to you to judge of it by comparison with those of
less popular authors above enumerated. In several
of these cases, beautifully illustrated editions have
been published, of which large numbers have been
sold. Of Mr. Longfellow's volume there have been
no less than ten editions. These various facts will
probably suffice to satisfy you that this country presents
a market for books of almost every description
unparalleled in the world."</p>

</div>

<p>If such a gratifying array of facts can
be made under the present system, what
might we not expect, if our native authors
were not brought into direct competition
with the pirated works of foreigners, and
the mental demands of our people were
answered by our own writers!</p>

<p>To what cause must we attribute the
startling facts, that, in this country, where
the taste for music is universal, where
there are more pianofortes manufactured
than in any other part of the world, and
where musical artists receive the highest
rewards, we cannot boast of one musical
composer of eminence? that where, next

<!-- vol 3 page 103 col 1 -->

to France, we most liberally support theatrical
establishments, we cannot boast of
one dramatic author? that where we pay
more than any other people for artistic
finery, we can boast of no ornamental
artists, and import nearly every thing that
ministers to our love of art? To what
cause must we, or can we, attribute these
anomalous facts but to the want of a law
which shall secure to the composer, the
ornamentalist, and the dramatist a right
of property in the products of genius and
industry? English manufacturers had
the shrewdness to see that while they enjoyed
the privilege of robbing French
artists of their designs, they could never
have a class of designers of their own, and
that the French manufacturers would
always excel them in the novelty and
elegance of their ornamental goods. The
English government, therefore, gave a
copy-right to French artists in their
designs for calico patterns, and all
other ornamental work, and immediately
there was a perceptible improvement in
British ornamental manufactures; under
the healthful influence of their registry
law, their manufacturing interests have
continued to improve, and their ornamental
artists to increase. Under the operation
of the law which prevented an American
citizen from owning a foreign built vessel,
the art of ship building has flourished
among us until we now stand at the head

<!-- vol 3 page 103 col 2 -->

of all the world in that great branch of
manufacturing industry. John Ruskin,
who is good authority on such a subject,
pronounces a ship the most beautiful and
noblest of all the works of man's ingenuity;
and, if we can excel all the world in the
greatest of all the arts, what is to prevent
our attaining to equal excellence in the
lesser arts of composing operas, writing
dramas, and designing calico patterns and
paper hangings? If we can build our own
ships, why cannot we write our own books?
There is no other reason, than the absence
of an international copy-right to protect
our intellectual labors from the destructive
competition of&mdash;not cheap labor, but
pirated manufactures.</p>

<p>When we commenced writing this article
we had only the newspaper reports
of the measure proposed by the administration
in relation to the duty on books;
we find, since, that it is proposed to admit
free of duty only editions printed previous
to 1830, which, of course, would not have
the disastrous effects we have anticipated
from an entire reduction of all duties on
books and periodicals. It is proper to
add, too, that Mr. Carey's Letters are addressed
to Senator Cooper of Pennsylvania,
in opposition to the international
copy-right treaty with Great Britain,
which was sent to the Senate by President
Fillmore.</p>

while labor becomes an amusement when
properly directed. A Down East captain
said to his crew, "Come, men, knock off
work and go to piling staves." We seek
amusement in a similar manner, by change
of occupation, and, in dancing all night
for pleasure, we work much harder than
we have done during the day at our regular
business. Amusements are as often
called recreations, which is, perhaps, a
better term: and the great point to be
determined is what kind of amusement
will yield the greatest amount of enjoyment,
or recreation, affording the overtaxed
mind and body opportunity to recover
their elasticity after having been subjected
to too tight a strain. A moment's thought
bestowed upon this subject will at once
tend to the conclusion that amusements
must be as varied as the employments of
the people to be amused. Our friend
Snip, the tailor, whose employment confines
him six days out of seven to his
shop-board, as well as Cocker, the book-keeper,
can conceive of no more delightful
recreation than a target excursion or a
party to the Fishing Banks; while Sam.

<!-- vol 3 page 141 col 2 -->

Jones, the fisherman, and Bob Brown, the
omnibus driver, imagine that the highest
heaven of enjoyment might be found in
the galley of a theatre, where the air
would be hot, and the shifting scenes as
unlike as possible to any thing they had
ever seen from a smack's deck or the top
of an omnibus. The amusements of a
people, therefore, while they must be congenial
to their habits, must also be antagonistical
to their employments; farmers'
boys would never go into the fields for
recreation, nor students to a lecture room;
and hence the impossibility of transplanting
national pastimes, or even of reviving
them when they have fallen into disuse.
If people are let alone, they will find
amusements best adapted to their necessities,
and therefore any legal restraints
placed upon the natural tendency of a
people in seeking for recreations must be
productive of mischief.</p>

<p>Bull-baitings, and cock-fightings, and the
sports of the turf, are revolting to certain
classes of people, but they are essential
means of recreation to certain other classes,
who, when deprived of such legitimate
amusements will seek the gratification of
their instincts in a more objectionable
manner. Instead of boisterous enjoyments
in the fields, they will create riots, mobs,

<!-- vol 3 page 142 col 1 -->

and rows in the streets. On board of men
of war it is the custom to pipe all hands
to mischief, occasionally, when the crew
have been a long time on shipboard, that
the necessity for abandonment and fun
may be spent in harmless excitement.
But for such safety valves, the irritation
of constant restraint would lead to insubordination
and mutiny. Commanders of
fleets and armies make timely arrangements
for the recreation of the men under
them, and it would be wise in our municipal
governors if they would do the same.
In most of the despotic countries of
Europe, the monarch finds it to his interest
to provide means of recreation to the
people free of cost, and these are generally
on a scale of inverse liberality to the
illiberality of the government. In no other
part of the world are the amusements of
the people more generously attended to
than in France, while in no other does the
individual enjoy so little of his individuality.</p>

<p>In this happy country of ours, where all
the natural instincts are allowed their
utmost expansion, it is very remarkable
that the amusements of the people are the
only affairs that are hampered by statutory
restrictions. One may follow any business
he likes, embrace any religion, join any
party, or engage in any enterprise; but
the law fixes the boundary of his amusements
and forbids his recreating himself
in certain ways. In the State of Connecticut,
the law prohibits all amusements
and recreations of a theatrical or dramatic
nature; Shakespeare may be read in the
parlor, or from the pulpit; but to present
Shakespeare's plays in the way they were
intended by their author to be represented,
is unlawful and would subject those guilty
of so wrong an act to fine and imprisonment.
Horse jockeying is an indigenous
trade in Connecticut, but riding horses for
the amusement of others is there an interdicted
employment. In the State of
Massachusetts, the laws are less rigorous,
and Shakespeare's plays may be represented
according to their author's intentions,
by the payment of a fee and under
a special license, on any night of the week
but Saturday and Sunday. On those two
evenings Shakespeare is interdicted as an
amusement in the good Old Bay State.
In this city, a man may establish a dozen
whisky distilleries, or manufacture firearms,
or quack medicines with perfect
freedom, without fee or license; but no
one can establish a place for theatrical
amusements without a special license and
paying for the privilege. Every theatre,
and opera house, and circus in New-York

<!-- vol 3 page 142 col 2 -->

has to pay a yearly fee which is appropriated
to the use of some public charity.
The theatre is one of the greatest anomalies
of modern civilization. It has been
an established institution in all civilized
countries, in the face of an opposition lasting
through 500 years, and it still stands.
Next to the sports of the chase it is the
oldest of all human recreations, and claims
for its votaries the loftiest geniuses that
have blessed mankind. The instincts of the
people demand its pleasures, and it will
find a footing wherever it is not excluded
by law. The taste for the stage is not
merely a love of tinsel and inexplicable
dumb show&mdash;it is the universal desire to
see the bright side of the world, and to
travel out of ourselves into the airy regions
of poetry and romance.</p>

<p>The persecution it has met, has been
deserved, where it fell upon the immoralities
unhappily united with it: but the
undiscriminating hostility to all dramatic
representations of human life, as something
iniquitous <i>per se</i>, is a mere folly, inexcusable
were it not for something worthy in
the feeling from which it sprung. Had the
stage been rescued to the purposes of virtue,
instead of having suffered outlawry among
the good, a powerful instrument would
have been saved to the better side. Not
only for the purposes of amusement, but of
mental culture, dramatic show is a natural
and efficient means. Regardless or thoughtless
of this, good men have let it decline
to base uses and then blamed the evil
which in some measure at least, they might
have prevented. Were every delicious
taste or art abandoned on the same ground
as the drama, our life would be bereft of
the benefit and solace of the whole of
them. There are great difficulties, no
doubt, in giving to the stage a high and
pure character&mdash;but are they insuperable?
Is there any reason why this as well as
any other natural taste may not be purged
and made a "minister of grace?" If
there be, still let us discriminate between
the thing itself and our own weakness.</p>

<p>It is a strange circumstance that while
music, painting, poetry, elocution, and
dancing, are not only considered as harmless,
but as elevating and beneficial arts,
in themselves, yet, when they are all combined
in the production of a drama they
are regarded as fit only to be anathematized.
The church, too, combines in its
ceremonials all these arts but the last,
and, in all Catholic countries eclipses the
feeble attempts of the stage, in their combination
to dazzle the senses and thrill the
imagination. Of course there can be no
comparison between the theatre and the

<!-- vol 3 page 143 col 1 -->

Church, because it is the province of the
one to amuse, and the other to instruct
the believer in the solemn mysteries of
eternal salvation. The stage, too, professes
to be moral, and the punishment of
vice is the inevitable end of all dramas.
There is no such <i>lusus</i> as an immoral
drama. It is the delight of the coarsest
natures to see poetical justice dealt out to
the wicked, and the sufferings of the virtuous
form the great staple of all tragedies.
There is nothing that so certainly commands
the tears of an audience, as the undeserved
calamities of the innocent. One
of our theatres has been reaping a harvest
of nightly benefits by exhibiting the untimely
death of a little girl, and the hardships
of a virtuous slave. The public go
to the National Theatre, in one of the
dirtiest streets of the city, where they sit
in not over-clean boxes, amid faded finery,
and tarnished gilding, to weep over Little
Eva and Uncle Tom. It takes us back to
the days &AElig;schylus, and convinces us that
the love of the drama is as strong as it
ever was, and that it must remain for ever
while men have hearts capable of being
moved by human suffering. The descent
from Prometheus to Uncle Tom, dramatically
considered, is not a very violent one,
nor so long as some may imagine.</p>

<p>It is the fashion with a certain class to
speak of the theatre as having outlived its
time, and being no longer necessary to the
people; but a reference to the history of
the stage, and an investigation into the
condition of our theatres would prove that
the theatre, as we observed just now, was
never before in so thriving a condition as
at present. Players are no longer vagabonds
by act of parliament, nor are they
exposed to any legal indignities here on
the ground of their profession. An actor
may now be buried in consecrated ground
in France, but this privilege was denied his
poor corpse in the days of Moli&egrave;re. Some
of our actors are men of large fortune, and
our actresses make themselves independent
and retire to private life while they are
yet young; and our managers become
millionaires, and men of social standing.
It is said that the stage pays well as a
profession to those who are tolerably well
qualified for it, and men of capital are not
averse to investing their money in theatrical
property. There are many pains-taking,
well-intentioned men who have gone
upon the stage, as coolly and deliberately
as other men have gone to the bar or the
pulpit, as a business pursuit, and have
maintained themselves and families respectably
by enacting the parts of "heavy
fathers," and filling the posts of "utility

<!-- vol 3 page 143 col 2 -->

men." It must be a sorry business, to be
sure, but hardly worse than being a
drudge in any other profession. The
vagabondage of the theatrical profession,
which is generally supposed to be the
necessary condition of all its members, is
rather imaginary than real. Actors are,
generally, when off the stage, the most
matter of fact and serious people to be
seen; many of them have other callings,
they engage in trade, or manufacturing,
and perform the parts of good citizens with
as much success as those of the stage villains
and heroes whom they personate for
a living. It was lately revealed to the
public that Salvi, the fascinating tenor of
the Italian Opera, when not employed
before the foot lights in fancy costume, was
superintending his large soap-boiling and
tallow candle establishment on Staten
Island&mdash;a revelation, that may hereafter
mar the effect of his <i>spirto gentil</i>
in the ears of the listeners who have so
often been charmed by his tender voice.
But it is not every actor who has the good
fortune to be connected with so substantial
a business as that of Salvi's; the actual
life of too many presents a melancholy
contrast to the stage splendors with
which they are associated in the minds
of the public, who imagine it is all fun and
hilarity behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mowatt, in her autobiography,
gives some instructive, glimpses of the
private life of the heroes of the stage, and
bears her testimony to the general good
character of the greater part of the members
of the profession which she joined as
a means of honorable independence. Even
in the profession of the ballet dancer,
which is looked upon as the lowest and
most degraded of the whole class of industrials
who draw their support from the
theatre, she says "there is nothing necessarily
demoralizing and degrading," and
she gives a slight sketch, but perfect as
far as it goes, of a poor ballet girl, who displayed
such a heroic spirit in the discharge
of her humble duties, that her history
should be sufficient to ennoble her despised
occupation. Mrs. Mowatt states that she
knew this real heroine of the stage, and
had the opportunity of watching her conduct
for several years.</p>

<p>"She had been educated as a dancer
from infancy. She had been on the stage
all her life; had literally grown up behind
the scenes of a theatre. Her parents
were respectable, though it is difficult to
define their position in the social scale.
At the time I knew her, her mother was
paralytic and bedridden. The father was
enfeebled by age, and could only earn a

<!-- vol 3 page 144 col 1 -->

pittance by copying law papers. Georgina,
the ballet girl, their only child, by her
energetic exertions, supplied the whole
wants of the family. And what were
those exertions? The mind of the most
imaginative reader could hardly picture
what I know to be a reality. Georgina's
parents kept no servant; she discharged
the entire duties of the household&mdash;cooking,
washing, sewing, every thing. From
daylight to midnight not a moment of her
time was unemployed. She must be at
rehearsal every morning at ten o'clock, and
she had two miles and a half to walk to
the theatre. Before that hour she had the
morning meal of her parents to prepare,
her marketing to accomplish, her household
arrangements for the day to make;
if early in the week, her washing; if in
the middle of the week, her ironing; if at
the close, her sewing; for she made all
her own and her mother's dresses. At
what hour in the morning must she have
risen?</p>

<p>"Her ten o'clock rehearsal lasted from
two to four hours&mdash;more frequently the
latter. But watch her in the theatre, and
you never found her hands idle. When
she is not on the stage, you were sure of
discovering her in some quiet corner&mdash;knitting
lace, cutting grate aprons out of
tissue paper, making artificial flowers, or
embroidering articles of fancy work, by
the sale of which she added to her narrow
means. From rehearsal she hastened home
to prepare the midday meal of her parents
and attend to her mother's wants. After
dinner she received a class of children, to
whom she taught dancing for a trifling
sum. If she had half an hour to spare,
she assisted her father in copying law
papers. Then tea must be prepared, and
her mother arranged comfortably for the
night. Her long walk to the theatre must
be accomplished at least half an hour before
the curtain rose&mdash;barely time to make
her toilet. If she was belated by her
home avocations, she was compelled to run
the whole distance. I have known this
to occur. Not to be ready for the stage
would have subjected her to a forfeit.
Between the acts, or when she was not
on the stage, there she sat again, in her
snug corner of the greenroom, dressed as
a fairy, or a maid of honor, or a peasant,
or a page, with a bit of work in her hands,
only laying down the needle, which her
fingers actually made fly, when she was
summoned by the call boy, or required to
change her costume by the necessities of
the play. Sometimes she was at liberty
at ten o'clock, but oftener not until half-past
eleven, and then there was the long

<!-- vol 3 page 144 col 2 -->

walk home before her. Her mother generally
awoke at the hour when Georgina
was expected, and a fresh round of filial
duties were to be performed. Had not
the wearied limbs which that poor ballet
girl laid upon her couch earned their sweet
repose? Are there many whose refreshment
is so deserved&mdash;whose rising up and
lying down are rounded by a circle so
holy?</p>

<p>"No one ever heard her murmur. Her
fragile form spoke of strength overtasked;
it was more careworn than her face.
That had always a look of busy serenity
off the stage, a softly-animated expression
when occupied before the audience in the
duties of her profession. She had a ready
smile when addressed&mdash;a meek reply when
rudely chided by the churlish ballet master
or despotic stage manager. Many a time
I have seen the tears dropping upon her
work; but if they were noticed, she would
brush them away, and say she was a fool
and cried for nothing. Her devotion to
her parents was the strongest impulse of
her nature. In her early youth she had
been engaged to a young man, a musician,
belonging to the orchestra. They had
been betrothed for several years. Some
fairer face, though he could scarcely have
found a <i>sweeter</i>, had rendered him faithless.
She bore her deep sorrow with that
lovely submission which elevates and
purifies the spirit, but gave her heart
away no more. The breath of slander
had never shadowed her name. Younger
and gayer girls in the theatre used to
designate her as the 'old maid,' but this
was the hardest word that any one ever
applied to Georgina. Was not such a
heart as hers what Elizabeth Barrett
Browning has described as</p>

<p class="small">'A fair, still house, well kept,<br/>

Which humble thoughts had swept,<br/>

And holy prayers made clean?'</p>

<p>"Her answer to a sympathizing 'How
weary you must be at night!' was, 'Yes;
but I am so thankful that I have health
to get through so much. What would
become of my poor mother or of my father,
if I fell ill?'</p>

<p>"How many are there who can render
up such an account of their stewardship
as this poor girl may give in the hereafter?
How many can say with her that life has
been</p>

<p class="small">'One perpetual growth<br/>

Of heavenward enterprise?'</p>

<p>"And this flower blossomed within the
walls of a theatre&mdash;was the indigenous
growth of that theatre&mdash;a <i>wallflower</i>, if
you like&mdash;but still sending up the rich

<!-- vol 3 page 145 col 1 -->

fragrance of gratitude to Him by whose
hand it was fashioned. To the eyes of
the Pharisee, who denounces all dramatic
representations, while with self-applauding
righteousness he boldly approaches the
throne of mercy, this 'ballet girl,' like
the poor publican, stood 'afar off.' To
the eyes of the great judge, which stood
the nearer?"</p>

<p>The theatrical business in New-York
has, until within a short time, been almost
entirely in the hands of Englishmen, and
even the majority of the players are still
foreigners, and it is doubtless owing in a

<!-- vol 3 page 145 col 2 -->

great degree to this fact, that the stage
has continued to lag in the rear of all
other institutions on this side of the
Atlantic; it has not appealed to the sympathies
and tastes of the people; the actors
have been aliens, and the pieces they performed
have all been foreign; to go inside
of our theatres was like stepping out of
New-York into London, where the scene
of nearly all the comedies presented is
laid. English lords and ladies, English
squires, clodhoppers, and Cockneys; English
rogues, English heroes, and English
humors form the staple of nearly all the

<!-- vol 3 page 146 col 1 -->

plays put upon our stage. The actors
and actresses speak with a foreign accent,
and all their allusions and asides are
foreign. The only places of amusement
where the entertainments are indigenous
are the African Opera Houses, where native
American vocalists, with blackened
faces, sing national songs, and utter none
but native witticisms. These native theatricals,
which resemble the national plays
of Italy and Spain, more than the performances
of the regular theatres, are
among the best frequented and most profitable
places of amusement in New-York.
While every attempt to establish an Italian
Opera here, though originating with the
wealthiest and best educated classes, has
resulted in bankruptcy, the Ethiopian
Opera has flourished like a green bay
tree, and some of the conductors of these
establishments have become millionaires.
It was recently proved that one of the
"Bone soloists" attached to a company of
Ethiopian minstrels, had spent twenty-seven
thousand dollars of his income within

<!-- vol 3 page 146 col 2 -->

two years. It is surprising that the
managers of our theatres do not take a
hint from the success of the Ethiopian
Opera, and adapt their performances to
the public tastes and sympathies. The
manager of the National Theatre, one of the
least attractive of all the places of public
amusement, has made a fortune by putting
Mrs. Stowe's Uncle Tom upon his stage.
Uncle Tom, as a drama, has hardly
any merit, it is rudely constructed, without
any splendors of scenery and costume,
or the fascinations of music; the
dialogue is religious, and the Bible furnishes
its chief illustrations; but it is
American in tone, all the allusions have a
local significance, and the sympathies of
the people are directly appealed to. The
result is an unheard-of success, such as
has never before been accorded to any
theatrical performance in the New World.
The manager of the National Theatre is
himself an American, and nearly all his
corps of actors are also natives, and though
he only aims at the tastes of the lowest

<!-- vol 3 page 147 col 1 -->

classes of the people, yet his theatre has
been daily and nightly filled with the
elite of our society, who are willing to endure
all the inconveniences which a visit
to the place imposes for the sake of enjoying
an emotion, such as neither the preaching
of their clergy, nor the singing of
Italian artists could create. A slight reaction
of popular favor towards the theatre
has been caused by the presence of Mr.
Bourcicault among us, the author of

<!-- vol 3 page 147 col 2 -->

London Assurance. To witness the first
representation of a new comedy by a
popular English dramatist has attracted a
class of people to the theatre who have
not been in the habit of frequenting it.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bourcicault's comedies are not
calculated to revive an interest in the
stage; they are artificial in their construction,
their characters are mere conventionalities
of the stage, the dialogue lacks
sincerity and wit, and the entire tone and

<!-- vol 3 page 148 col 1 -->

sentiment of his plays are foreign to us.
He nowhere gives that touch of nature
which makes the whole world kin, but
compels us all the while to feel that we are
assisting at an alien performance. There is
one point, however, he may claim the credit
of having established; he has greatly improved
the upholstery of the stage, and,
by the introduction of "real furniture"
transformed the before bare-looking scenes
of interiors into something which bears a
recognizable resemblance to a modern
drawing-room. Mr. Bourcicault is the
most successful of the present class of
English dramatists; but, the regular
drama died with Sheridan; since the
School for Scandal was produced, there
has been no play written in England which
stands the remotest chance of being known
by name half a century hence. The regular
drama is as foreign now to the wants

<!-- vol 3 page 148 col 2 -->

of the theatre, as the Greek tragedy, or
the mediaeval mysteries. The theatre
survives for other purposes than the representation
of the drama; its presentations
are merely sensuous, and not intellectual;
Shakespeare is only endured for
the sake of the star actor who impersonates
the one character suited to his physical
powers. The pieces which attract
audiences and fill the treasury are as un-Shakespearian
as possible. Tableaux,
burlesques, thrilling melo-dramas, ballets,
spectacles, horses, dwarfs, giants, rope-dancers,
any thing that is monstrous and
wonderful, form now the great attractions
of the theatres, and any thing is considered
as "legitimate" by the public, which
affords amusement, and as proper, by the
manager, which fills his house.</p>

<p>The lecture-room has now become a
kind of compromise between the theatre

<!-- vol 3 page 149 col 1 -->

and the Church, it is a neutral ground,
upon which all parties and conditions
may, and do meet, and the peripatetic
star lecturer occupies nearly the same position
which Roscius did in the early days
of the stage. The greatest achievements
in poetry are the plays which were never
intended for print; and. doubtless, the
best additions to our literature will be the
lectures which were only written to amuse
an audience, and not intended for publication
in another form.</p>

<p>There are innumerable places of recreation
in such cities as New-York, which
are not properly entitled to be classed under
the head of places of public amusement,
which we are considering now.
The theatre has always been, and still
is, the principal place of public amusement,
and, though its character has
greatly changed, and its frequenters are
no longer of the class who once gave it its
chief support, it occupies too prominent a
place in the social organization of our
great towns to be overlooked by professed
moralists and religious teachers. Its existence,
and the fact of its being frequented

<!-- vol 3 page 149 col 2 -->

by immense numbers of people whose
morals need looking after, should be sufficiently
strong reasons for the clergy, and
all others who are by virtue of their office
public teachers, to exert themselves to
render it as little harmful as possible.
To stand outside and denounce the theatre
without knowing any thing of its interior,
is not the true way to improve it. The
representation of moral, and even religious
plays has been found not only very effective
upon the audiences who attend upon
them, but profitable to the manager who
brings them out.</p>

<p>As religious novels form a very considerable
part of the popular books of the day,
we see no reason why religious dramas
should not also form an important part
of theatrical entertainments. The fact
that such a drama as Uncle Tom's Cabin
can be represented two hundred nights in
succession, at one of the lowest theatres in
New-York, converting the place into a
kind of conventicle, and banishing from it
the degraded class, whose presence has
been one of the strongest objections to the
theatre which has been made by moralists,

<!-- vol 3 page 150 col 1 -->

is sufficient to show that religious plays,
like religious novels, may be pressed into
the service of education with powerful
effect. It is stated by Mrs. Mowatt, in
her autobiography, from which we have
already quoted, that in the catalogue of
English dramatic authors there are the
names of two hundred clergymen. But
we imagine that none of these have written
any religious plays. There are six regular
theatres in New-York, which are open
nearly every night in the year, excepting
Sundays, for dramatic representations, and
the public that sit night after night with a
fortitude and good nature to us incredible,
to see the School for Scandal and the Lady
of Lyons would be but too happy to vary
their amusements by a religious drama, if
it were only new and intelligible. The
chief of our city theatres, which claims to
be the Metropolitan, since the destruction
of the Old Park, is the Broadway. It is
a very large house, capable of seating
some 4300 persons. It was built by
Col. Alvah Mann, a great circus proprietor,
who ruined himself by the speculation,
and is now the property of Mr.
Raymond, another millionaire of the ring.
Broadway is a "star house," and depends
more upon the attraction of a single eminent
performer than upon the general
character of its performances, or its stock
company; and it is at one time a ballet,
another a tragedian, again an opera, then
a spectacle, that forms its attractions.
Forrest has here appeared one hundred
nights in succession; here too Lola Montez
made her debut in America, and any
wandering monstrosity is seized upon by
the manager to secure an audience. The
regular drama, excepting with the attraction
of a star, is found to be a regular bore
to the public, and a regular loss to the
house. The manager of the Broadway,
E. A. Marshall, Esq., is neither an actor
nor a dramatist, but simply a man
of business; and, besides the Broadway
Theatre, he is also proprietor of the Walnut
Street Theatre, Philadelphia, and of
the theatres in Baltimore and Washington.
Neither the exterior nor interior of this
house is at all creditable to the city; it
has a shabby and temporary look externally,
and the ornamentation of the auditorium
is both mean and tawdry. No
class of people seem to frequent it for
recreation but only to gratify an excited
curiosity.</p>

<p>The "Bowery," which is the oldest of
all the theatres in New-York, is about
the same dimensions as the Broadway,
but has a stage of much greater depth,
and better adapted to spectacle. It is

<!-- vol 3 page 150 col 2 -->

frequented chiefly by the residents of the
eastern side of the city, and its pit is generally
filled with boisterous representatives
of the first families in the city&mdash;that is, the
first in the ascending scale. The performances
at the Bowery are, of course,
adapted to the tastes of its audiences, who
have a keen relish for patriotic devotion,
terrific combats, and thrilling effects, and
are never so jubilant as when suffering
virtue triumphs over the machinations of
persecuting villainy. It was for such
audiences as these, with a slight infusion
of better natures, that Shakespeare wrote
his dramas, and for whose amusement he
was willing to personate the humblest of
his creations. The present edifice is the
fourth that has been erected on the same
ground, since the first one was erected in
the year 1826, the others having been
destroyed by fire. The late proprietor
of the Bowery Theatre amassed a fortune
here, and left the establishment to his
heirs, to whom it now belongs. It is understood
to be a very profitable concern,
as it has been from its first erection. It
was in the Bowery Theatre where Madame
Hutin, the first opera dancer seen on this
side of the Atlantic made her <i>debut</i>, and
where the first ballet was performed, one of
the troupe being the then unknown Celeste.
It was here, too, that Malibran made her
first appearance on the stage after her unfortunate
marriage, and filled the house with
the beauty, fashion, and intellect of the
city. Such audiences have never since
graced its pit and galleries. It was on the
stage of the Bowery that Forrest achieved
his greatest triumphs, and laid the foundation
of his fame. But it is long since stars
of such magnitude have shed their sweet
influences on Bowery audiences.</p>

<p>Niblo's is not, strictly, a theatre, but a
show house, open to any body that may
choose to hire it. It is one night a circus,
another an Italian Opera House; then a
dramatic temple, and then a lecture room.
It is called a "garden," but it is one of
the roomiest, best constructed, and most
convenient of all the places of amusement
in the city, and is unexceptionable in its
character. Its interior decorations are
very inferior to the other theatres, but it
has the great advantage of being clean and
well ventilated. The entrance to it,
through the Metropolitan Hotel, is extremely
elegant and capacious. Under
the same roof, within the walls of the
same hotel is Niblo's Saloon, a splendid
room used for concerts and balls. The
whole ground now covered by the Metropolitan
Hotel was once Niblo's Garden,
and the theatre was merely an appendage

<!-- vol 3 page 151 col 1 -->

to it to draw custom to the refreshment
tables.</p>

<p>There are two theatres in New-York,
and but two which are devoted exclusively
to the performance of the regular drama;
these are Burton's in Chambers-street, and
Wallack's in Broadway. Burton's Theatre
was, originally, a bath-house, and was
afterwards turned into an Italian Opera
House, in the management of which a
good deal of money was lost, and Palmo,
the proprietor ruined. Burton then took
possession of it, and made a fortune. It
was the first instance in which a theatre
in this city had fallen into the hands of a
manager of scholarly attainments and
artistic instincts, and the result of his
management shows what may be effected
by talent turned in the right direction.
Mr. Burton has not only enriched himself,
but has done the public a service by affording
them a place of harmless and elevating
amusement. One of the first pieces
that he put upon his stage was Milton's
Comus, which gave the public assurance
that the new manager was a person of
education and refinement; and the uniform
good judgment shown by him in the
pieces he has selected, and the superior
manner in which they have been costumed,
have made his theatre a superior place of
intellectual entertainment for people of
educated tastes. Mr. Burton is one of the
best low comedians on the stage, and is,
himself, one of the strongest attractions
of his theatre. But, like a true artist, he
never hesitates to take a subordinate part,
when it is necessary to give completeness
and effect to a performance. He has a
devoted attachment to his art, and goes
through with his nightly performances,
sometimes appearing in three different
pieces, with a degree of vigor, and careful
attention to all the minute accessories of
his part, which we could only look for
in an enthusiastic acolyte in the temple
of art. Mr. Burton is an Englishman;
but, unlike most of his countrymen, he
left his native country behind him, when
he crossed the Atlantic, and became
thoroughly American in his feelings. He
was bred to the profession of a printer,
and, after his arrival in this country engaged
in several literary enterprises. He
established the Gentleman's Magazine,
now called "Graham's."</p>

<p>Wallack's Lyceum, in Broadway, is an
exceedingly elegant little house, the style
of the interior decoration is in excellent
taste, and the effect of a full house is
light, cheerful, exhilarating, and brilliant.
James Wallack, the manager and proprietor,
is the head of a large family remarkable

<!-- vol 3 page 151 col 2 -->

for the possession of theatrical talent.
He was a celebrated actor in London more
than thirty years ago, and is still one of
the best players in his line,&mdash;the genteel
heroes of melo-drama,&mdash;on the stage. But
he rarely makes his appearance before the
foot lights. Wallack's Lyceum is Burton's
without Burton. Great attention is always
paid to the production of pieces at
this brilliant little house, and the costumes
and scenery form an important part of the
attraction. English comedy and domestic
dramas form the chief attractions at Wallack's,
and the house is generally full.
The utmost order and decorum are maintained,
both at this house and Burton's,
and every thing offensive to the most delicate
taste carefully excluded from the
stage.</p>

<p>The National Theatre in Chatham-street
has long been the resort of newsboys and
apprentices, and the style of performances
has been very similar to those of the
"Bowery;" but, in a happy moment, the
manager, a good natured native whom they
call Captain Purdy, put Uncle Tom's
Cabin upon his stage and at once raised
his fortune and changed the character of
his house. As it has played this piece
twice a day for nearly six months, and is
now the family resort of serious family
parties, it would be rather hazardous to
predict what its future course may be;
the old Chatham Theatre was converted
into a chapel, and Captain Purdy's is
half way towards the same destiny.</p>

<p>Attached to Barnum's Museum there
is a large, well arranged, and showily decorated
theatre for dramatic representations,
where domestic dramas of a moral
character are performed, and a version of
Uncle Tom adapted to Southern tastes has
been a long time running. The "St.
Charles," is a small theatre in the Bowery
which was built for an actor named Chanfrau,
who was the creator of the universally
recognized character of Mose, the
type of the New-York <i>gamin</i>.</p>

<p>The Italian Opera House in Astor Place
has been adapted to the uses of the Mercantile
Library Association; and the new
opera house in Irving-place, which bids
fair to be one of the most magnificent
structures devoted to music in the world,
is not yet sufficiently built to be described;
but we shall describe it hereafter.</p>

<p>Since we commenced writing this article
the most beautiful and spacious place of
popular recreation in New-York has been
swept out of existence by one of those
sudden and disastrous conflagrations which
have earned for New-York the appellation
of the City of Fires. Metropolitan Hall,

<!-- vol 3 page 152 col 1 -->

which was unrivalled for its extent and
splendor by any concert room in the
world, together with the superb marble-fronted
hotel in which it was inclosed,
with all their wealth of embellishment
and taste, the embodied forms of labor,
genius, and skill were suddenly whiffed
out of existence on the morning of the
8th of January. The engravings which we
have the good fortune to possess of these
superb structures are all that now remain,
but the memories of those ornaments of
our city.</p>

<p>Castle Garden, the unique, remains,
where opera, music, and the drama are
presented by turns. It is a hall of unequalled
advantages for public exhibitions,
which was originally a fort, but has long
been appropriated to the refining arts of
peace.</p>

<p>The Ethiopian minstrels have become
established entertainments of the public,
and among them are three permanent companies
in Broadway; the Buckleys, Christy's,
and Wood's, where the banjo is the
first fiddle, and the loves of Dinah and
Sambo form the burthen of the performances.</p>

<p>The Italian Opera, too, is now an established
institution in the New World, but
it leads a vagabondish kind of a life at
present, and has no permanent house of
its own, although one is erecting for it.

<!-- vol 3 page 152 col 2 -->

We are neither wealthy enough nor sufficiently
educated in music to monopolize
an Italian troupe at present, but are compelled
to share this luxury in common
with our neighbors of Boston, Philadelphia,
Havana, Mexico, Valparaiso, and
Lima. The Italian Opera is the highest
order of theatrical entertainment, and demands
a class of educated and wealthy
people for its proper support more numerous
than we have yet been able to boast
of. There are never more than half a
dozen good singers before the public at a
time, and in competing for their services,
we have to contend with, not the people
of other cities, but with their monarchs,
the Emperor Nicholases and Emperor Napoleons,
who never hesitate to spend the
money of their subjects to purchase pleasures
for themselves.</p>

<p>The circus is still the most popular of
public amusements, and it is conducted
on a magnificent scale as a regular business
speculation by enterprising citizens.
The most famous riders now in Europe are
graduates of the American ring. The
Hippodrome, in the Fifth Avenue, was an
attempt to transplant Franconi's from
Paris. But the Hippodrome was too
exotic to thrive in our climate, and, after
a season of doubtful success, it has closed
probably for ever.</p>

<h3>THE CRUISE OF THE STEAM YACHT NORTH STAR.</h3>

</div>

<p class="small"><i>The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star; a
Narrative of the Excursion of Mr. Vanderbilt's
Party to England, Russia, Denmark, France,
Spain, Italy, Malta, Turkey, Madeira, etc.</i> By
the REV. JOHN OVERTON CHOULES, D. D., Author
of the "History of Missions," "Young Americans
Abroad," etc. Boston, Gould &amp; Lincoln, 1854.</p>

<p>NEVER, since the day when Noah took
his sons and his sons' wives on board
the Ark, has there been so large a family
party afloat as that which embarked with
the patriarch Vanderbilt, on his pleasure
trip to Europe. It was altogether a most
memorable and remarkable excursion, and
better worth being commemorated than
many voyages of greater pretensions.
When the North Star appeared in the
British waters, the London journals while
chronicling the event and expressing
their admiration of the yacht, and the
splendid liberality of its patriarchal
owner, consoled themselves with the reflection
that there were plenty of self-made
millionaires on the London Exchange,
who were rich enough in pocket, but too
poor in spirit, to indulge in such ostentatious
pleasures.</p>

<p>The London News said. "Those who
ought to be the Vanderbilts of England,
would shrink from employing their
wealth in the magnificent manner adopted
by their American friend. They would
dread the effect of making any unusual
display which would surely subject them
to the reproach of being millionaires and
parvenues." Poor creatures! Our Cosmo
Vanderbilts are rather proud of being
parvenues and the creators of their own
fortunes, and would rather than not
be accounted millionaires. "Here is the
great difference between the two countries,"
continues the <i>News</i>. "In England
a man is too apt to be ashamed of having

<!-- vol 3 page 546 col 2 -->

made his own fortune, unless he has
done so in one of the few roads which the
aristocracy condescend to travel by&mdash;the
bar, the church, or the army."</p>

<p>Think of getting rich by the church!
That which should disgrace a Christian
is, it appears, one of the three paths to
honor in England. God be praised that
we were born on this side of the Atlantic!
"And if he is vulgar enough not to feel
ashamed of himself," continues the candid
<i>News</i>, "his wife and children make
amends by sedulously avoiding every thing
which can put other people in mind of
their origin. It was thought something
superhumanly heroic in Sir Robert Peel
to confess he was the son of a cotton spinner,
though every body knew it." Well
then might John Bull open wide his eyes
at the apparition of the North Star steaming
into Southampton water!</p>

<p>The North Star was a steamship of the
first class, which was built expressly for
her owner to make a pleasure voyage
to Europe in, and, of course, combined
all the requisites to insure comfort and
safety which money could procure. She
left New-York last May, having on board
Commodore Vanderbilt, his wife and eighteen
of his sons and sons-in-law and
daughters and daughters-in-law; in addition
there were Doctor Linsly, the family
physician, and his wife, and the Rev.
John Overton Choules, D. D. and his
wife.</p>

<p>A happier party, or one better satisfied
with their prospects, according to Dr.
Choules, never crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="small">Hiss went the steam, round went the wheels,<br/>

Were never folk so glad.</p>

<p>Doctor Choules was to officiate as chaplain
and historiographer of the excursion

<!-- vol 3 page 547 col 1 -->

and, if ever we go a yachting to Europe,
most fortunate shall we esteem ourselves
if we can engage so jovial and sunny-minded
a D. D. to act in a similar capacity.
We fear there are but few such
chaplains, and we know that there have
never been many such good-natured
chroniclers of voyages. If there were any
disagreeables attending the excursion, our
author, for one, did not see them. He saw
nothing but a nimbus of lambent glory
surrounding the ship in which he sailed,
and encircling every object that he encountered.
His glasses were tinged with rose-color,
all odors were agreeable that saluted
his wide nostrils, and none but the sweetest
and genteelest sounds ever reached his
ears. His presence must have been perpetual
sunshine in the saloons, and on
the deck of the North Star. He heard,
we have not a doubt,</p>

<p class="small">"&mdash;&mdash;a mermaid on a dolphin's back,<br/>

Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,<br/>

That the rude sea grew civil at her song."</p>

<p>For he naively remarks at the close of
his volume that, although one of the
passengers "reckoned up sixteen days of
bad weather," "he did not remember
one he should call a regular storm." So
uniform is the chaplain's amiable temper,
and so resolutely was he bent on
looking only upon the silver linings of
black clouds, that he has even a good
word for the Emperor Nicholas, an unhappy
man, whom all the rest of the
world unites in execrating. Dr. Choules
says, he has "heard anecdotes in plenty
respecting the Czar, and all of them reflect
great honor upon the qualities of
his head and heart," and he left Russia
"with exalted opinions of the wisdom and
patriotism of the Emperor."</p>

<p>The incipient state of great events is
always a subject of interest to the world,
and Dr. Choules records the time and
the place when Mr. Vanderbilt first revealed
to him the project of his pleasure
voyage, and made its future historian acquainted
with the happiness which was
in store for him.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Early in the spring of the present year," says our
author, "the attention of the country was directed to
an item in the daily papers of New York, containing
information that Mr. Vanderbilt was constructing
a steam-ship of large dimensions, which he intended
as a yacht for the accommodation of his family
and some invited friends in a voyage to the
principal sea-ports in Europe. The announcement
of this project excited a deep interest in the public
mind, and the excursion became a prominent subject
of conversation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vanderbilt was known to his countrymen as
a thoroughly practical man, whose energy and perseverance,
combined with strong intellect and high commercial

<!-- vol 3 page 547 col 2 -->

integrity, had given him immense wealth;
all his undertakings had been crowned with signal
success, and his great enterprise in opening a communication
with the Pacific by the Nicaragua route
had made him a reputation in Europe; and a general
expectation existed that he would carry out his plan
in a manner that would redound to the honor of the
country. Various opinions were entertained as to his
ultimate designs. Many imagined that Mr. Vanderbilt
proposed to effect some great mercantile operation,&mdash;he
was to sell his ship to this monarch, or that
government,&mdash;or, he was to take contracts for the
supply of war steamers; all sorts of speculations were
entertained by that generally misinformed character,&mdash;<i>the
public</i>. In February I was sitting with Mr.
Vanderbilt in his library, when he gave me the first
information I had received of his intentions, and he
kindly invited me and my wife to accompany him to
Europe in the month of May. The ship was then on
the stocks, but he named the very day on which he
should sail, and gave me the details of his proposed
route, and from which few deviations were afterwards
made. Mr. V. expressly informed me that his sole
object was to gratify his family and afford himself an
opportunity to see the coast of Europe, which he
could do in no other way; and he observed that, after
more than thirty years' devotion to business, in all
which period he had known no rest from labor, he
felt that he had a right to a complete holiday."</p>

</div>

<p>The style of Doctor Choules is equal to
his subject, being free, flowing, and easy,
and though here and there a sentence occurs
to which a severe or pedantic critic
might object, it is very readable, amiable
and pleasant. It would be impossible for
the most ill-natured of the whole tribe of
critics not to relent and grow tenderly
good-humored while accompanying the
pleasant author on his rose-tinted excursion.
There is one sentence in the preface
of the Doctor's book which, we must confess,
rather startled us before we got entirely
through with it. "This world is
full of beauty," says Doctor Choules, "and
it teems with wonders; and I never see a
fresh portion of God's earth, but I feel
some respect for the old gentleman's opinion,"&mdash;the
remainder of the sentence
leaves us room to imagine what the good
Doctor means, but as the oddness of its
phrasing did not at the first glance permit
us to discover it. we were rather startled
until we did&mdash;"who, on going from Maine
to Albany for the first time that he had
left his native State, declared, on his return,
that the world was more extensive
than he had supposed."</p>

<p>It will be perceived that the two D.'s
which the reverend historian wears at the
end of his name are no hindrance to his
enjoyment of a small joke. There are
several like it in the volume.</p>

<p>It was a remarkably fine moonlight
night as the North Star steamed past
"one of the sweetest islands of the world,"
where the venerable mother of Mr. Vanderbilt
resided, in whose honor "rockets

<!-- vol 3 page 548 col 1 -->

were let off and a gun fired;" and when
the pilot left the yacht outside Sandy
Hook, he was presented with a "purse
of gold, which was intended to show that
no blame was attached to him by Mr.
Vanderbilt," for an accident which had
delayed the steamer the day before.
"Soon after leaving Sandy Hook," says
Dr. Choules, "Mr. Vanderbilt requested
me to conduct family worship on board
the ship throughout the voyage, and to
appoint such an hour as I thought most
suitable. It was accordingly agreed that
prayers should be attended every evening
at nine o'clock, and that grace should be
said at all the meals on board ship."
The voyage commenced most auspiciously,
and Dr. Choules remarks, on the very
first day out, "it seemed a happiness to
exist," and, as he immediately after says,
"our table was equal to that of any hotel
in America, and the desserts rivalled in
richness any thing that I have witnessed
in the Astor, Metropolitan and St. Nicholas;"
we have no doubt that the seeming
was a reality. Not only were the desserts
rich, but the music was delightful. "One
gentleman of the party possessed a fine
taste in Italian music&mdash;the ladies were
always in voice&mdash;the sailors, too, were decidedly
fond of negro melody. One of
them who answered to the euphonious
name of Pogee, was thought to be quite
equal to the Christy Minstrels." The first
sermon preached by the Doctor, he informs
us, was on the 22d of May, "the
text selected for the occasion, Proverbs
xvi. 32; 'He that is slow to anger is better
than the mighty; and he that ruleth
his spirit than he that taketh a city.'
The singing was fine, and the accompaniment
of the piano very acceptable."
Doctor Choules had a very natural admiration
for his generous patron. "Often,"
says he, "did I wish that more than the
members of our privileged company could
have seen him day by day kind and attentive
to his officers, polite and liberal
to his guests. Mr. Vanderbilt I had long
known to be possessed of great qualities,
a mighty grasp of intellect, and capabilities
of the highest order. Yet till I entered
upon this voyage I did not adequately
appreciate his knowledge of men, his
fine tact, his intuitive perception of the
fitting, and his dignified self-control; and
I felt glad that such a man, self-made as
he is, should be seen by the accidental
sons of nobility and fortune in the Old
World."</p>

<p>The amenities and splendors of the
voyage across the Atlantic came to an end
on the 1st of June, and, quite as a matter

<!-- vol 3 page 548 col 2 -->

of course. "it was one of England's most
joyous, brilliant mornings," when the
doctor and his companions woke up in
Southampton water, "and gazed out
upon as richly cultivated a landscape as
the southern coast of England can present."
Here the party "found several
fine hotels;" but we are sorry to learn
that one, called the New York Hotel,
which had the star-spangled banner displayed,
did not favorably impress "some
of our gentlemen who repaired to it for a
lunch." This was about the only unfavorable
impression which seems to have been
made upon the party during this brilliant
excursion, but the Doctor adds that "Radley's
Hotel near the railroad, and, I think,
the Dolphin, are well-kept houses." The
unfavorable impression caused by the unfortunate
lunch which had a star-spangled
banner to recommend it, probably soon
wore off, for the Doctor immediately grows
amiable again. But a poor lunch was not
a thing to be passed over by so exemplary
a chaplain, and so veracious a historian.
It was one of the few dark spots
in the bright picture he has given us of
this memorable excursion. Every thing
is beautiful, fine, glorious and charming,
excepting that unfortunate lunch. They
see some soldiers, and the Doctor remarks
"they looked like fine fellows."
He calls upon the Rev. Thomas Adkins
in Southampton, whom he had known
many years ago. "I told the ladies,"
says the Doctor, "that Mr. Adkins used
to be regarded as one of the noblest looking
men in England&mdash;and our ladies
thought him one of the most splendid
men they had ever seen." The next day
they were off for London, and in Winchester
"partook of the hospitalities of Mr.
Alderman Andrews, whose name is so
endeared to Americans." The Doctor was
anxious to "get in" at his "old favorite
house, the Golden-Cross, nearly opposite
to Northumberland House, but Mr. Gardiner
was unable to take even half our
number." How natural that he should
desire to get in at the Golden-Cross, so
fitting an emblem of that cross which he
bore about. The Doctor informs us with
much satisfaction that the house where
they at last "found good accommodations,"
was the St. James' Hotel, in Germyn-street.
"Two or three noblemen reside
in this hotel, <i>and one, Lord Blayney,
has made it his city residence for
many years</i>." The day of their arrival
in London happened to be a "drawing-room."
"Every street was thronged
with carriages (<i>we imagine this is not
to be taken literally</i>) waiting for their

<!-- vol 3 page 549 col 1 -->

turn to take up the company at the palace.
The coachmen and footmen all had
immense bouquets in their bosoms, and
the splendid liveries, and powdered heads,
and white wigs of the drivers were novelties
to most of the North Star party."
The Doctor was anxious to know "what
would be the first object of curiosity to
the ladies, and was not a little surprised
to find that the Thames Tunnel was
voted for as the primary visit." Doctor
Choules is a great lover of rural scenery,
and, while the other members of the
party were seeing the lions in London he
took a run down to his native Bristol to
refresh himself with views of the scenery
of the Avon. In the ecstasy of again beholding
the scenes of his boyhood he exclaims,
"I really believe that either from
the impressions which I received in childhood
in this glorious region, or from some
peculiar organization (<i>we rather imagine
it is the organization</i>), I have felt so
much delight in rambling abroad among
scenes of beauty, sublimity, and historical
interest. O, the happy hours of my boyhood
that I have passed in this village, on
the Avon's banks! And, what tea-drinkings
have I had in these cottages, and in
the arbors which surround them!" The
child is father to the man beyond a cavil.
Returned to London, the excursionists
went to hear "the Hon. and Rev. Baptist
Noel, brother to the Earl of Gainsborough,"
preach. The Rev. gentleman
"has a fine figure," and, "we were much
gratified with the prayer offered." The
next day "Mr. Peabody proffered Mr.
and Mrs. Vanderbilt and ladies the use
of his boxes that evening at the Opera,
and as long as they remained in town."
Whether Doctor Choules visited the opera
or not we are not informed, but we are
sorry to learn from "a notice of the opera
furnished by one of the gentlemen of the
party who was present," that the splendor
of the scene was not quite up to their
expectations. Like the lunch at Southampton
the opera was a failure. "It was
the height of the season; a large and
fashionable assemblage filled the house;
England's favorite Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert were there; and many of
the fairest and noblest of the land, <i>yet
we were disappointed</i>. The spectacle
was not so gorgeous and brilliant as we
had expected on a court night,&mdash;neither
in the first <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>, the beauty of the
ladies, nor the elegance of the toilet."
This is not Dr. Choules; he would not
have been disappointed, neither in the
<i>first</i>, nor the second <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>. "The
Queen" we are informed, by this disappointed

<!-- vol 3 page 549 col 2 -->

gentleman, "wore a rich white
dress, exceedingly <i>decolt&eacute;</i>, covered with
point lace, and an ornament of great
value,&mdash;a magnificent pearl&mdash;on the stomacher.
Prince Albert is a tall, stout-looking
man, light-haired, and partially bald.
His appearance was any thing but aristocratic,
<i>notwithstanding he exhibited a
large star on his left breast, and a wide
crimson silk ribbon over a white waist-coat.
We searched scrutinizingly among
the noble circles to discover something
in form or feature marking the stamp
of hereditary nobility; but in vain.</i>"
"Four of the party dined with Mr. Peabody
at Richmond to meet Senator Douglas.
The dinner was an elegant repast."
In the evening they went to a levee at
Mr. Ingersoll's, our Minister, where "the
display of diamonds was very brilliant."
On the 8th of June they attended a soiree
at the Lord Mayor's; "the Lord Mayor
was the Right Honorable Thomas Challis,
a wealthy merchant in Hides." Diamonds
and dinners did not absorb all the
attention of our chronicler, he "was especially
delighted with the glorious collection
of old books at Mr. Toovey's, 42
Picadilly. On one occasion he met with
three distinguished bibliopolists at this
shop&mdash;Lord Hastings, Sir David Dundas,
and Mr. Henry Foss."</p>

<p>The party were greatly favored atmospherically
during their stay in London.
The Doctor sagaciously remarks, that "the
state of the weather is in England a
never failing subject of conversation among
her population. This arises from its frequent
changes. During our visit in London
of ten or twelve days, we had no reason
to complain, it was charming." We
are informed that "the ladies experienced
much enjoyment in a visit to Madame
Tussaud's great museum of notables in
wax." On their return to Southampton
the party had the gratification of hearing a
sermon from the Rev. Alexander Maclaren,
a Scotch Baptist, and "we all felt the
force of the preacher's subject;&mdash;<i>The
Dignity of Man</i>. But when he described
man's apostacy and ruin, no one could
fail to experience the emotions of Isaiah,
who exclaimed, 'I abhor myself in dust
and ashes.'</p>

<p>But the Doctor soon recovered from his
state of self-abhorrence, for, on the next
page he is again on the best of terms with
himself, and goes off in a most glowing
and appetizing account of the great banquet
given by the Mayor and merchants
of Southampton to the owner of the
North Star.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"On our arrival at Southampton, we found the

<!-- vol 3 page 550 col 1 -->

streets placarded with notices of a public entertainment
at the Victoria Rooms; and a very superbly-engraved
card, in gilt letters, with a fine likeness of the
North Star in the centre, surrounded by gilt flags and
the arms of Southampton, was addressed to each
member of the party. As a memorial of the voyage,
I annex the card of invitation which I received on
the occasion:</p>

<p class="center">THE MAYOR,<br/>

MERCHANTS AND TRADERS AT SOUTHAMPTON,<br/>

Request the pleasure of the Rev. Dr. and Mrs.<br/>

CHOULES' company at a DEJEUNER, on MONDAY,<br/>

13 June, 1S53, at the Royal Victoria<br/>

Assembly Rooms, in honor<br/>

of the visit of<br/>

COMMODORE VANDERBILT,<br/>

In his splendid Steam Yacht North Star.</p>

<p>At 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>"Monday, the 13th of June, was a most delightful
day; and when we came on deck we found the flags
of the shipping in dock all gayly waving to the
breeze, and noticed banners from the hotels and public
buildings, while the church-bells were ringing
merry peals of cheer and gladness. Every thing denoted
mirth and holiday, and our feelings were somewhat
peculiar when we felt that all this was a matter
in which we were personally concerned, and was intended
for the honor of our ship, her owner, and our
country."</p>

</div>

<p>The account of the festivities at this
place occupies some forty pages of the
Doctor's book. From Southampton they
go to Copenhagen, Cronstadt and St.
Petersburgh, and even in the cold Baltic
Sea there is sunshiny splendor to
greet the North Star. At Southampton,
at Bristol, at London, and at Rome, it was
the loveliest spot, but in Peterhoff, says
good Dr. Choules, the trees, the flowers,
the greensward, &amp;c. "transcend all that
I have known of the beauty of country
life in any part of the world." At the
hotel, "the provisions were excellent, and,
as we found every where in Russia, entirely
in the style of the French cuisine."
Going to St. Petersburgh they went to
the Hotel des Princes, but it was too full
to receive so large a company, and they
were treated to a splendid lunch,&mdash;"the
waiters spread a table and placed on it
bread, butter, anchovies, caviare, claret,
sherry, brandy, ice and cakes in variety.
This excellent lunch was very seasonable,
as it was now twelve o'clock, and the day
intensely hot." On calling for the bill
the host refused to accept of any pay!
The Doctor was ravished, charmed, enchanted,
by the splendors of the imperial
residences, and particularly by the
wonders of the hermitage of Catharine the
Second. "The room containing the diamonds
and regalia excited the interest of
all in our party; and on no consideration
would we have been deprived of the
pleasure of seeing this unrivalled collection

<!-- vol 3 page 550 col 2 -->

of treasures. Rubies, diamonds,
emeralds and pearls&mdash;why, the room was
full of them. The imperial crown pleased
us better than any diadem I have seen in
the regalia of other kingdoms."&mdash;O!
prophet Isaiah! The Doctor is refreshed
by the recollection that this was the
palace of "the Great Catharine," who
certainly was great in a way immortalized
by Lord Byron&mdash;and in presence
of its three thousand pictures, says, "I
confess that the Dutch school is my
passion!" Pictures of game, and fruits
and flowers are more to the taste of the
chaplain of the North Star, than saints,
Magdalens and Ecce Homos; the picture
which seems to have interested him
most was "the Interior of a Stable," by
Wouvermans. His rapid enumeration of
the riches of the Imperial palaces, the
gold, silver and diamonds in the churches
is really dazzling, and they seem to have
made an indelible impression upon his
imagination. In describing the Isaac
Church, he says: "No man can fail to
be impressed with this wonderful pile.
The exquisite proportions of this church
seem to diminish its apparent size. I
have only to say that here are monoliths,
of Finland marble, sixty feet high, <i>forming
peristyles of unsurpassed beauty;</i>
and, in the interior are columns of malachite
fifty feet high, which adorn the
altars. Malachite, lapis-lazuli, porphyry
and gold, all seem to vie with each other
for pre-eminence in this glorious pile."</p>

<p>Dr. Choules is not one of those ascetics
who refuse to do in Rome what the Romans
do. "On the Sabbath which we
spent in St. Petersburgh, we found a
wedding feast celebrated at our hotel;
and, in going to our dining-room at supper
time, the waiters took us through the
room where the festivities were going on.
Excellent music and spirited dancing
seemed to have put the party into high
spirits." Lunches appear to make an
indelible impression upon his mind. "At
Mr. Wilkins' hospitable abode Captain
Eldridge, his lady, and a few of us, partook
of an elegant lunch which we shall
often think of with pleasure. Such sweetmeats
I never tasted," &amp;c. But, what
were the lunches, the churches, the diamonds,
the pictures, the sweetmeats, the
caviare, the brandy, the claret and the
cakes of St. Petersburgh, without the
good genius who presides over all&mdash;the
Czar? Not seeing him was omitting the
Prince of Denmark from the tragedy of
Hamlet. "Our great regret at leaving
Russia," says Dr. Choules, "is not having
seen the great, and, I believe, good man,

<!-- vol 3 page 551 col 1 -->

the emperor, who has done so much to
elevate the condition of the masses in his
extensive dominions, and to improve the
entire country. I leave Russia with exalted
opinions of the wisdom and patriotism
of the emperor, and doubt not that,
if his life be spared, Russia will continue
to advance in all that makes a country
great and powerful and happy. I have
heard anecdotes in plenty respecting the
Czar, and all of them reflect great honor
upon the qualities of his head and heart;
but I do not feel that I am at liberty to
state them in this public manner, as they
were related to me in the social circle, by
men who are favorably situated to know
their truth. Some of our party saw the
emperor at the church of the palace, at
Peterhoff; but I spent that Sabbath in
the city. Had we remained a day or two
longer, we should have seen the emperor
on board; but his time and thoughts had
all been engrossed with the pressing affairs
of the great vexed question between Russia
and Turkey."</p>

<p>The good chaplain cannot write long at
a time without introducing something
good to eat or drink, and occasionally
creature comforts come in very whimsical
juxtaposition with passages of sentiment
or piety. The yacht had reached
Copenhagen when they were called upon
to part with one of their members. The
event is thus touchingly mentioned:
"Here we parted from our young friend
Allen, who was to proceed from this city,
by way of Kiel and Hamburgh, to Leipsic,
and resume his studies. We found a
fine supply of strawberries," &amp;c. &amp;c. From
Copenhagen the yacht went to Havre,
and the excursionists spent three delightful
weeks in Paris; from Havre to the Mediterranean,
and they entered the "charming
bay of Malaga on Sunday, July 3lst."
They were put in quarantine; but what
of that? "with such a sky, such a temperature,
and such a prospect," says the
Doctor, "I never could be better off. And
there came a boat full of good things,
vegetables of all sorts, but, best of all,
of grapes; the grapes of Frontenac, Muscat,
and Sweetwater." The good things
were none the less welcome for being
brought off on Sunday.</p>

<p>We should be most happy to transfer to
our pages some of the purple tints of Malaga
with which the chronicler of the cruise
of the North Star has illuminated his narrative;
but we have already dipped more
freely into his volume than we intended
doing. From Malaga they pursue their
course to Leghorn, passing Gorgona, "so
famous for its anchovies;" at Leghorn

<!-- vol 3 page 551 col 2 -->

they find "an excellent table," and go to
the Opera. "The Sabbath-day, Aug. 7,
was a delightful day. At our breakfast
we had a fine supply of figs and peaches."
In Leghorn the Doctor had the pleasure
of preaching the gospel.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"It is pleasant to know that pure evangelical truth
is here proclaimed, even amid the black darkness of
Popery; and I was glad of an opportunity to preach
the gospel in Italy, and there to join in prayer with
God's people, that He would soon overturn the Man
of Sin, who, impiously placing himself in the seat of
the Almighty, lays claim to infallibility. But God
declares that he will not give his glory to another;
and Popery, by this fatal assumption of a divine attribute,
has tied around her neck the apocalyptic
millstone, which is at last to sink her to the bottomless
abyss. Mr. Henderson is a Scotch gentleman,
who has long resided here; he is an eminent merchant
and banker, and has a mercantile house in
Liverpool and Canada. He sent the first export of
marble to New York, and a small quantity over-stocked
the market."</p>

</div>

<p>From Leghorn the party visited Florence,
where the Patriarch of the excursion
sat to Powers for his bust, and Mrs. Vanderbilt
to our countryman Hart. Naples,
Valetta and Constantinople were next
visited, but the excursionists were denied
a sight of Rome, much to the regret of
Dr. Choules and the ladies' maids. On
their return to Gibraltar they had delightful
picnics in the cork woods, and rambles
and scrambles about the rock; and,
says our chaplain&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"On Thursday evening, Mr. Clark, Major Labau
and I, accepted an invitation to dine with the officers
of the 44th at their quarters upon the Rock. At six
o'clock we repaired to the Club-house, where we
were to meet our kind friends, who would take
charge of us. At sundown we had the pleasure to
listen to the noble band which plays every evening
in the square, and never did music sound more
sweetly than that calm night. Having ordered our
boatmen to meet us at the Ragged Staff, as the town
gates would be closed on our return, we at a little
past seven got into the carriage and ascended the
rock, which is a slow process, but every winding turn
showing us new beauties, and at eight we reached
the comfortable quarters of the regimental mess. A
more superb look-out was never seen than this building
affords.</p>

<p>"The accommodations are very fine, and all that
gentlemen can desire. At a little past eight we were
summoned to the dining-room, and a more magnificent
one is not easily found. It was a company night,
of which there are two every week. There were
twenty-two or twenty-four officers at table, all in uniform.
The table was loaded with massive plate, belonging
to the regiment, which is distinguished for
the elegance of its equipage.</p>

<p>"Our dinner was one of the best I ever met out of
Paris; indeed, it was thoroughly Parisian, as the arrangements
of the mess are under the supervision of
an artist from the French capital. The epergnes
were very large, and bear the name of the regiment;
and the immense candelabra and other adornments
rendered it a brilliant scene.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 552 col 1 -->

<p>"I am quite sure that the kind speeches of the
generous, high-minded officers of the 44th, and their
friends of other regiments, will long he remembered
by each of their American guests. I shall never
hear the Rock of Gibraltar spoken of without
thinking of the 44th regiment, and our friends
Brown, Higgins, Deering, Thornhill, and others
whose faces I can recall much easier than their
names."</p>

</div>

<p>From Gibraltar the yacht proceeded to
Funchal, Madeira, and here they encountered
a most remarkable man in the person
of a publican.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"We all dined on shore, at Mr. Tates' hotel, and
found an admirable table, with the best of attention.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tates was formerly a sergeant in the British
army, and resides here on account of his health,
which is much improved by the climate. On conversing
with our host, I was surprised to find him
possessed of so much intelligence; and, in reply to
my inquiries on many subjects, I at once discovered
that he was a man of considerable reading. Mr. Tates
invited me into his study, and I was conducted into
a very charming retreat, where I met with a far finer
library of the best books than can usually be met

<!-- vol 3 page 552 col 2 -->

with in a clergyman's study in New England. The
cast of the proprietor's mind was evidently in favor
of theology and metaphysics, and not often do I fall
in with a better collection of the best authors. Mr.
Tates is a hard student, a close thinker; and, although
at least fifty, he is diligently employed in the
acquisition of the Latin language. I was delighted
with my visit to this charming study, which commands
a view of the ocean and the unrivalled beauty
of the island mountain range."</p>

</div>

<p>On Friday, the 23d of September, the
yacht re-entered the bay of New York, and
we fully coincide in the opinion expressed
by the reverend chronicler of this remarkable
and happy excursion, that "such a
cruise was never attempted before;" but,
if Dr. Choules' good-natured and lively
volume should be extensively read, we
have no doubt that some other of our
generous millionaires will be tempted to
emulate the splendid liberality of the
fortunate owner of the North Star; but
we can hardly hope ever again to read
such a volume as his chaplain has presented
us.</p>

<h3>A YANKEE DIOGENES.</h3>

</div>

<p class="small"><i>Walden; or, Life in the Woods</i>. By HENRY D.
THOREAU. Boston: Ticknor &amp; Fields. 1854.</p>

<p>THE New England character is essentially
anti-Diogenic; the Yankee is
too shrewd not to comprehend the advantages
of living in what we call the
world; there are no bargains to be
made in the desert, nobody to be taken
advantage of in the woods, while the
dwellers in tubs and shanties have slender
opportunities of bettering their condition
by barter. When the New Englander
leaves his home, it is not for the pleasure
of living by himself; if he is migratory
in his habits, it is not from his fondness
for solitude, nor from any impatience he
feels at living in a crowd. Where there
are most men, there is, generally, most
money, and there is where the strongest
attractions exist for the genuine New
Englander. A Yankee Diogenes is a
<i>lusus</i>, and we feel a peculiar interest in
reading the account which an oddity of
that kind gives of himself. The name of
Thoreau has not a New England sound;
but we believe that the author of <i>Walden</i>
is a genuine New Englander, and of
New England antecedents and education.
Although he plainly gives the reasons
for publishing his book, at the outset, he
does not clearly state the causes that led
him to live the life of a hermit on the
shore of Walden Pond. But we infer
from his volume that his aim was the
very remarkable one of trying to be
something, while he lived upon nothing;
in opposition to the general rule of
striving to live upon something, while
doing nothing. Mr. Thoreau probably
tried the experiment long enough to test
its success, and then fell back again into
his normal condition. But he does not
tell us that such was the case. He was
happy enough to get back among the
good people of Concord, we have no
doubt; for although he paints his shanty-life
in rose-colored tints, we do not
believe he liked it, else why not stick to
it? We have a mistrust of the sincerity
of the St. Simon Stylites', and suspect that
they come down from their pillars in the
night-time, when nobody is looking at
them. Diogenes placed his tub where
Alexander would be sure of seeing it,
and Mr. Thoreau ingenuously confesses
that he occasionally went out to dine,
and when the society of woodchucks
and chipping-squirrels were insufficient

<!-- vol 4 page 443 col 2 -->

for his amusement, he liked to go into
Concord and listen to the village gossips
in the stores and taverns. Mr. Thoreau
informs us that he lived alone in the
woods, by the shore of Walden Pond, in
a shanty built by his own hands, a mile
from any neighbor, two years and a half.
What he did there besides writing the
book before us, cultivating beans, sounding
Walden Pond, reading Homer, baking
johnny-cakes, studying Brahminical theology,
listening to chipping-squirrels,
receiving visits, and having high imaginations,
we do not know. He gives us the
results of his bean cultivation with great
particularity, and the cost of his shanty;
but the actual results of his two years
and a half of hermit life he does not
give. But there have been a good many
lives spent and a good deal of noise made
about them, too, from the sum total of
whose results not half so much good
could be extracted as may be found in
this little volume. Many a man will
find pleasure in reading it, and many a
one, we hope, will be profited by its
counsels. A tour in Europe would have
cost a good deal more, and not have produced
half as much. As a matter of
curiosity, to show how cheaply a gentleman
of refined tastes, lofty aspirations
and cultivated intellect may live, even in
these days of high prices, we copy Mr.
Thoreau's account of his first year's operations;
he did better, he informs us,
the second year. The entire cost of his
house, which answered all his purposes,
and was as comfortable and showy as he
desired, was $28 12&half;. But one cannot
live on a house unless he rents it to
somebody else, even though he be a
philosopher and a believer in Vishnu.
Mr. Thoreau felt the need of a little
ready money, one of the most convenient
things in the world to have by one, even
before his house was finished.</p>

<p>"Wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars
by some agreeable and honest method,"
he observes, "I planted about two acres
and a half of light and sandy soil, chiefly
with beans, but also a small part with
potatoes and corn, peas and turnips."
As he was a squatter, he paid nothing
for rent, and as he was making no calculation
for future crops, he expended
nothing for manure, so that the results
of his farming will not be highly instructive
to young agriculturists, nor be likely
to be held up as excitements to farming

<!-- vol 4 page 444 col 1 -->

pursuits by agricultural periodicals. He
says:</p>

<p>"My farm outgoes for the first season
were, for implements, seed, work, &amp;c.,
$14 72&half;. The seed corn was given me.
This never costs anything to speak of,
unless you plant more than enough. I
got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen
bushels of potatoes, besides some peas
and sweet corn. The yellow corn and
turnips were too late to come to anything.
My whole income from the farm
was</p>

<table>

<tr><td></td><td>$23 44</td></tr>

<tr><td>Deducting the outgoes,</td><td>14 72&half;</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>

<tr><td>There are left,</td><td>$8 71&half;</td></tr>

</table>

<p>besides produce consumed and on hand
at the time this estimate was made of the
value of $4 50,&mdash;the amount on hand
much more than balancing a little grass
which I did not raise. All things considered,
that is, considering the importance
of a man's soul and of to-day, notwithstanding
the short time occupied
by my experiment, nay, partly even because
of its transient character, I believe
that that was doing better than any
farmer in Concord did that year."</p>

<p>We will not extract the other items
which Mr. Thoreau favors us with in
the accounts of his <i>m&eacute;nage</i>; according
to his figures it cost him twenty-seven
cents a week to live, clothes included;
and for this sum he lived healthily and
happily, received a good many distinguished
visitors, who, to humor his style,
used to leave their names on a leaf or a
chip, when they did not happen to find
him at home. But, it strikes us that all
the knowledge which the "Hermit of
Walden" gained by his singular experiment
in living might have been done
just as well, and as satisfactorily, without
any experiment at all. We know
what it costs to feed prisoners, paupers
and soldiers; we know what the cheapest
and most nutritious food costs, and how
little it requires to keep up the bodily
health of a full-grown man. A very
simple calculation will enable any one
to satisfy himself in regard to such points,
and those who wish to live upon twenty-seven
cents a week, may indulge in that
pleasure. The great Abernethy's prescription
for the attainment of perfect
bodily health was, "live on sixpence a
day and earn it." But that would be
Sybaritic indulgence compared with Mr.
Thoreau's experience, whose daily expenditure
hardly amounted to a quarter
of that sum. And he lived happily, too,

<!-- vol 4 page 444 col 2 -->

though it don't exactly speak volumes in
favor of his system to announce that he
only continued his economical mode of
life two years. If it was "the thing,"
why did he not continue it? But, if he
did not always live like a hermit, squatting
on other people's property, and depending
upon chance perch and pickerel
for his dinner, he lived long enough by
his own labor, and carried his system of
economy to such a degree of perfection,
that he tells us:</p>

<p>"More than five years I maintained myself
thus solely by the labor of my hands,
and I found that by working about six
weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses
of living. The whole of my winters,
as well as most of my summers,
I had free and clear for study. I have
thoroughly tried school-keeping, and
found that my expenses were in proportion,
or rather out of proportion, to my
income, for I was obliged to dress and
train, not to say think and believe, accordingly,
and I lost my time into the
bargain. As I did not teach for the
good of my fellow-men, but simply for a
livelihood, this was a failure. I have
tried trade; but I found that it would
take ten years to get under way in that,
and that then I should probably be on
my way to the devil. I was actually
afraid that I might by that time be doing
what is called a good business. When
formerly I was looking about to see what
I could do for a living, some sad experience
in conforming to the wishes of
friends being fresh in my mind to tax
my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously
of picking huckleberries; that
surely I could do, and its small profits
might suffice,&mdash;for my greatest skill has
been to want but little,&mdash;so little capital
it required, so little distraction from my
wonted moods, I foolishly thought.
While my acquaintances went unhesitatingly
into trade or the professions, I
contemplated this occupation as most like
theirs; ranging the hills all summer to
pick the berries which came in my way,
and thereafter carelessly dispose of them;
so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I
also dreamed that I might gather the
wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such
villagers as loved to be reminded of the
woods, even to the city, by hay-cart
loads. But I have since learned that
trade curses everything it handles; and
though you trade in messages from heaven,
the whole curse of trade attaches to
the business.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 445 col 1 -->

<p>"As I preferred some things to others,
and especially valued my freedom, as I
could fare hard and yet succeed well, I
did not wish to spend my time in earning
rich carpets or other fine furniture,
or delicate cookery, or a house in the
Grecian or Gothic style just yet. If
there be any to whom it is no interruption
to acquire these things, and who know
how to use them when acquired, I relinquish
to them the pursuit. Some are "industrious,"
and appear to love labor for
its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps
them out of worse mischief; to such I have
at present nothing to say. Those who
would not know what to do with more
leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise
to work twice as hard as they do,&mdash;work
till they pay for themselves, and
get their free papers. For myself, I
found that the occupation of a day-laborer
was the most independent of any, especially
as it required only thirty or
forty days in a year to support one. The
laborer's day ends with the going down
of the sun, and he is then free to devote
himself to his chosen pursuit, independent
of his labor; but his employer, who
speculates from month to month, has no
respite from one end of the year to the
other.</p>

<p>"In short, I am convinced, both by
faith and experience, that to maintain
one's self on this earth is not a hardship
but a pastime, if we will live simply
and wisely; as the pursuits of the
simpler nations are still the sports of the
more artificial. It is not necessary that
a man should earn his living by the sweat
of his brow, unless he sweats easier than
I do."</p>

<p>There is nothing of the mean or sordid
in the economy of Mr. Thoreau,
though to some his simplicity and abstemiousness
may appear trivial and
affected; he does not live cheaply for
the sake of saving, nor idly to avoid labor;
but, that he may live independently
and enjoy his great thoughts; that he
may read the Hindoo scriptures and

We must do him the credit to
admit that there is no mock sentiment,
nor simulation of piety or philanthropy in
his volume. He is not much of a cynic,
and though we have called him a Yankee
Diogenes, the only personage to whom
he bears a decided resemblance is that
good humored creation of Dickens,
Mark Tapley, whose delight was in being
jolly under difficulties. The following

<!-- vol 4 page 445 col 2 -->

passage might have been written by Mr.
Tapley if that person had ever turned
author, for the sake of testing the provocatives
to jollity, which may be found
in the literary profession:</p>

<p>"Sometimes, when I compare myself
with other men, it seems as if I were
more favored by the gods than they, beyond
any deserts that I am conscious
of; as if I had a warrant and a surety
at their hands which my fellows have
not, and especially guided and guarded.
I do not flatter myself, but if it be possible
they flatter me. I have never felt
lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a
sense of solitude, but once, and that was
a few weeks after I came to the woods,
when, for an hour, I doubted if the near
neighborhood of man was not essential
to a serene and healthy life. To be alone
was something unpleasant. But I was
at the same time conscious of a slight
insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee
my recovery. In the midst of a
gentle rain, while these thoughts prevailed,
I was suddenly sensible of such
sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in
the very pattering of the drops, and in
every sound and sight around my house,
an infinite and unaccountable friendlyness
all at once like an atmosphere sustaining
me, as made the fancied advantages
of human neighborhood insignificant,
and I have never thought of them
since. Every little pine needle expanded
and swelled with sympathy and befriended
me. I was so distinctly made
aware of the presence of something
kindred to me, even in scenes which we
are accustomed to call wild and dreary,
and also that the nearest in blood to me
and humanest was not a person nor a
villager, that I thought no place could
ever be strange to me again.</p>

<p class="small">'Mourning untimely consumes the sad;<br/>

Beautiful daughter of Toscar.'</p>

<p>"Some of my pleasantest hours were
during the long rain storms in the spring
or fall, which confined me to the house
for the afternoon as well as the forenoon,
soothed by their ceaseless roar and
pelting; when an early twilight ushered
in a long evening in which many
thoughts had time to take root and unfold
themselves. In those driving northeast
rains which tried the village houses
so, when the maids stood ready with
mop and pail in front entries to keep the
deluge out, I sat behind the door in my
little house, which was all entry, and

<!-- vol 4 page 446 col 1 -->

thoroughly enjoyed its protection. In
one heavy thunder shower, the lightning
struck a large pitch-pine across the
pond, making a very conspicuous and
perfectly regular spiral groove from top
to bottom, an inch or more deep, and
four or five inches wide, as you would
groove a walking-stick. I passed it
again the other day, and was struck with
awe on looking up and beholding that
mark, now more distinct than ever,
where a terrific and resistless bolt came
down out of the harmless sky eight years
ago. Men frequently say to me, 'I
should think you would feel lonesome
down there, and want to be nearer folks,
rainy and snowy days, and nights especially.'
I am tempted to reply to such,&mdash;This
whole earth which we inhabit is
but a point in space. How far apart,
think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants
of yonder star, the breadth of
whose disc cannot be appreciated by
our instruments? Why should I feel
lonely? Is not our planet in the Milky
Way? This which you put seems to me
not to be the most important question.
What sort of space is that which separates
a man from his fellows and makes
him solitary? I have found that no exertion
of the legs can bring two minds
much nearer to one another. What do
we want most to dwell near to? Not to
many men surely, the depot, the post-office,
the bar-room, the meeting-house,
the school-house, the grocery, Beacon
Hill, or the Five Points, where men most
congregate, but to the perennial source
of our life, whence in all our experience
we have found that to issue, as the willow
stands near the water and sends out
its roots in that direction. This will
vary with different natures, but this is
the place where a wise man will dig his
cellar. * * I one evening overtook
one of my townsmen, who has accumulated
what is called 'a handsome property,'&mdash;though
I never got a fair view
of it,&mdash;on the Walden road, driving a
pair of cattle to market, who inquired
of me how I could bring my mind to
give up so many of the comforts of life.
I answered that I was very sure I liked
it passably well; I was not joking. And
so I went home to my bed, and left him
to pick his way through the darkness
and the mud to Brighton,&mdash;or Bright-town,&mdash;which
place he would reach
some time in the morning."</p>

<p>There is a true vagabondish disposition
manifested now and then by Mr. Thoreau,

<!-- vol 4 page 446 col 2 -->

which, we imagine, was more powerful
in leading him to his eremite way of life,
than his love of eastern poetry, and his
fondness for observing the ways of snakes
and shiners. If there had been a camp of
gipsies in the neighborhood of Concord, he
would have become a king among them,
like Lavengro. It breaks out here with
unmistakable distinctness:</p>

<p>"As I came home through the woods
with my string of fish, trailing my pole,
it being now quite dark, I caught a
glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across
my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage
delight, and was strongly tempted
to seize and devour him raw; not that
I was hungry then, except for that wildness
which he represented. Once or
twice, however, while I lived at the
pond, I found myself ranging the woods,
like a half-starved hound, with a strange
abandonment, seeking some kind of
venison which I might devour, and no
morsel could have been too savage for
me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably
familiar. I found in myself,
and still find, an instinct toward a
higher, or, as it is named, spiritual life,
as do most men, and another toward a
primitive, rank, and savage one, and I
reverence them both. I love the wild
not less than the good. The wildness
and adventure that are in fishing still recommend
it to me. I like sometimes to
take rank hold on life and spend my day
more as the animals do. Perhaps I have
owed to this employment and to hunting,
when quite young, my closest acquaintance
with Nature. They early introduce
us to and detain us in scenery with
which otherwise, at that age, we should
have little acquaintance. Fishermen, hunters,
woodchoppers, and others, spending
their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar
sense a part of Nature themselves,
are often in a more favorable mood for
observing her in the intervals of their
pursuits, than philosophers or poets even,
who approach her with expectation.
She is not afraid to exhibit herself to
them. The traveller on the prairie is
naturally a hunter, on the head waters
of the Missouri and Columbia a trapper,
and at the Falls of St. Mary a fisherman.
He who is only a traveller learns things
at second-hand and by the halves, and is
poor authority. We are most interested
when science reports what those men already
know practically or instinctively,
for that alone is a true <i>humanity</i>, or account
of human experience.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 447 col 1 -->

<p>"They mistake who assert that the
Yankee has few amusements, because
he has not so many public holidays, and
men and boys do not play so many games
as they do in England, for here the more
primitive but solitary amusements of
hunting, fishing and the like, have not
yet given place to the former. Almost
every New England boy among my contemporaries
shouldered a fowling-piece
between the ages of ten and fourteen;
and his hunting and fishing grounds
were not limited like the preserves of an
English nobleman, but were more boundless
even than those of a savage. No
wonder, then, that he did not oftener
stay to play on the common. But already
a change is taking place, owing,
not to an increased humanity, but to an
increased scarcity of game, for perhaps
the hunter is the greatest friend to the
animals hunted, not excepting the Humane
Society."</p>

<p>There is much excellent good sense
delivered in a very comprehensive and
by no means unpleasant style in Mr.
Thoreau's book, and let people think as
they may of the wisdom or propriety of
living after his fashion, denying oneself
all the luxuries which the earth can afford,
for the sake of leading a life of lawless
vagabondage, and freedom from
starched collars, there are but few readers
who will fail to find profit and refreshment
in his pages. Perhaps some practical
people will think that a philosopher
like Mr. Thoreau might have done the
world a better service by purchasing a
piece of land, and showing how much it
might be made to produce, instead of
squatting on another man's premises,
and proving how little will suffice to
keep body and soul together. But we
must allow philosophers, and all other
men, to fulfil their missions in their own
way. If Mr. Thoreau had been a practical
farmer, we should not have been
favored with his volume; his corn and
cabbage would have done but little towards
profiting us, and we might never
have been the better for his labors. As
it is, we see how much more valuable to
mankind is our philosophical vagabond
than a hundred sturdy agriculturists; any
plodder may raise beans, but it is only one
in a million who can write a readable volume.
With the following extract from
his volume, and heartily recommending
him to the class of readers who exact
thoughts as well as words from an
author, we must take leave, for the present,
of the philosopher of Walden Pond.</p>

<!-- vol 4 page 447 col 2 -->

<p>"Most men appear never to have
considered what a house is, and are
actually, though needlessly poor all their
lives, because they think that they
must have such an one as their neighbors
have. As if one were to wear
any sort of coat which the tailor might
cut out for him; or, gradually leaving off
palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin,
complain of hard times because he could
not afford to buy him a crown! It is
possible to invent a house still more convenient
and luxurious than we have,
which yet all would admit that man
could not afford to pay for. Shall we
always study to obtain more of these
things, and not sometimes to be content
with less? Shall the respectable citizen
thus gravely teach by precept and example,
the necessity of the young man's
providing a certain number of superfluous
glowshoes, and umbrellas, and empty
guest chambers for empty guests, before
he dies? Why should not our furniture be
as simple as the Arab's or the Indian's?
When I think of the benefactors of the
race, whom we have apotheosized as
messengers from heaven, bearers of divine
gifts to man, I do not see in my
mind any retinue at their heels, any carload
of fashionable furniture. Or what
if I were to allow&mdash;would it not be singular
allowance?&mdash;that our furniture
should be more complex than the Arab's,
in proportion as we are morally and intellectually
his superiors! At present
our houses are cluttered and defiled with
it, and a good housewife would sweep
out the greater part into the dust-hole,
and not leave her morning's work undone.
Morning work! By the blushes
of Aurora, and the music of Memnon,
what should be a man's <i>morning work</i>
in this world? I had three pieces of
limestone on my desk, but I was terrified
to find that they required to be dusted
daily, when the furniture of my mind
was all undusted still, and I threw them
out of the window in disgust. How,
then, could I have a furnished house?
I would rather sit in the open air, for no
dust gathers on the grass, unless where
man has broken ground.</p>

<p>"It is the luxurious and dissipated who
set the fashions which the herd so diligently
follow. The traveller who stops
at the best houses, so called, soon discovers
this, for the publicans presume him
to be a Sardanapalus, and if he resigned
himself to their tender mercies he would
soon be completely emasculated. I think
that in the railroad car we are inclined
to spend more on luxury than on safety

<!-- vol 4 page 448 col 1 -->

and convenience, and it threatens, without
attaining these, to become no better
than a modern drawing-room, with its
divans, and ottomans, and sunshades,
and a hundred other oriental things,
which we are taking west with us, invented
for the ladies of harem and the
effeminate natives of the Celestial Empire,
which Jonathan should be ashamed

<!-- vol 4 page 448 col 2 -->

to know the names of. I would rather
sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself,
than be crowded on a velvet cushion.
I would rather ride on earth in an
ox-cart with a free circulation, than go
to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion
train, and breathe a <i>malaria</i> all the
way."</p>

<p class="center">A RETROSPECT AND A PROSPECT.</p>

<p>IN his notes to the republication of that tremendous screed which, Mr. Carlyle
calls "Shooting Niagara&mdash;and After," the troubled author declares his opinion
that, "in fifty years hence, all serious souls will have quitted literature, and that
for any noble man, or useful person, it will be a credit rather to declare, 'I never
tried literature; believe me, I have never written any thing.' "</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle may be endowed with the gift of prophecy; but, for our own
part, we incline to the belief that fifty years hence will be very much like fifty
years since, as far as literature is concerned, and that serious souls and noble
men, as well as noble women, will be quite as ambitious of being known as
the authors of something clever, as they ever were. It is just fourteen years
since we had the honor to assist in getting out the first number of PUTNAM'S
MONTHLY; and, so far from feeling at all ashamed of it, we confess to a feeling
of pride, rather, in the part we took in it, and, on the whole, derive
considerable satisfaction in remembering the cosy little dinner in a certain
cosy house in Sixteenth-street, at which the plan of the work was discussed and
the adventure determined upon. As this is only a gossippy little prelude, and not
a grave essay, it will not be considered improper, we trust, if we mention, confidentially
to the reader, that the little party consisted of Mrs. Caroline M.
Kirkland, Mr. George Sumner, Mr. Parke Godwin, Mr. George W. Curtis, Mr.
and Mrs. Putnam, and the present writer. It was but fifteen years ago, and of
that little party two are already gone. The rest remain to assist in the revival
of the work which was then so pleasantly and so auspiciously begun.</p>

<p>Fourteen years ago, the first number of PUTNAM'S MONTHLY was launched
upon the troubled waters of this wayward world, as an experiment in literary
navigation. Many predicted that it could not keep afloat, who yet hoped
that it might, and did what they could to falsify their own predictions. But
those who commenced it, and were responsible for its success, had no misgivings;
and the result justified their faith and rewarded their efforts. The
MONTHLY was in every respect not only a success, but a distinguished success.
It earned not only a decided reputation for itself, but for many youthful adventurers
in literature, hitherto unknown, who contributed to its pages. The chief
doubt in the minds of many was, whether the country could furnish the requisite
number of writers to sustain an original magazine of the better class; but the
experiment proved that there was plenty of latent talent which only required an
opportunity for its development. The second question was, whether a public existed
capable of appreciating and able to support a publication such as it was the
aim of the projectors to furnish. These were strange doubts in a country that had

<!-- ns vol 1 page 2 -->

produced writers like Irving and Cooper, and where every laborer was a reader.
But the first number dispelled all doubts, and thenceforth all went well.</p>

<p>"But the work stopped," remarks some sagacious friend.</p>

<p>True enough. It did stop, but it did not die. Ships sometimes drop anchor
and furl their sails, and then spread their canvas again and make prosperous
voyages, as if nothing had happened; while other ships founder at sea and
pass out of men's memories. But the MONTHLY was so strong and healthful
in its constitution, so distinct in its individuality, and so much a necessity, that
it could not well come to grief. Through certain misadventures, which need not
be particularly noted here, the work stopped for a while, but anxious inquiries
have constantly been heard as to when it would reappear; for no one seemed
willing to believe that it had stopped for good. It was a strange thing, that the
metropolis of the continent, the centre towards which the wealth, the intellect, the
enterprise, the refinement, and the adventures of the New World all tend, should
not be able to support its one original, first-class magazine; and many have been
the demands why this should be so.</p>

<p>When the old "PUTNAM" furled its sails for a season, the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> was
launched, and "took the flood" of public favor, sailing out upon the broad ocean,
where it still floats prosperous. We have always and naturally been proud of
that fellow-voyager, in whose build and trim we fondly recognize so much that is
most familiar to us; and as "PUTNAM" again shakes out its sails, and heads for
the open sea, it signals its consort "Good-morrow," and runs up its streamer with
its old motto, "Excelsior."</p>

<p>One of the sincere friends and counsellors who most earnestly hoped for
the success of the MONTHLY, and yet, with characteristic frankness, expressed
his fears that its projectors were too sanguine in their expectations, was
Washington Irving. The mention of this honored name sadly reminds us of
other friends who were eager to help, by their counsel or contributions, in
giving stability to the work, who are no longer here to aid or encourage us.
As we glance over the names of the contributors to the earlier numbers of
the MONTHLY, the black dashes which indicate the departures of those who
helped us once, but can help us never more, are startling from their frequency.
First on the list we find the name of William North, who wrote "The
Living Corpse," in the first number. He was a young Englishman of good
family, who had then but recently arrived in New York; a wild, impulsive
creature, frank, generous, impatient of restraint, full of brilliant projects, hating
routine, and bent on reforming mankind on the instant. He had published a periodical
in London called "North's Magazine," and commenced various literary
enterprises after his arrival in this country. But, after a brief career, he died by
his own hand, and now lies in Greenwood Cemetery. Fitz-James O'Brien contributed
"Our Young Authors" to the first number of the MONTHLY, and afterwards
became better known by many brilliant contributions in prose and verse to
various periodicals. He was a young Irishman, who landed in New York in
the same week with William North. He was a man of remarkable gifts and
of very comely presence, brave, generous, and impulsive. At the outbreak
of the war he volunteered in defence of the Union, and, while serving on the
staff of General Lander, in Western Virginia, was mortally wounded in an
encounter in which he displayed great gallantry. His death, which did not
occur until after he had undergone the amputation of his right arm, was
remarkable for the heroic cheerfulness he displayed in his sufferings. The Rev.
Dr. Francis L. Hawks, who wrote the article in the first number of the MONTHLY
on "The Late John L. Stephens," and some others, died in the Autumn of 1866.
Henry D. Thoreau, better known now than then, contributed "An Excursion to
Canada," and was the author of several articles in subsequent numbers. He
died in 1862. "Virginia in a Novel Form," a serial commenced in the first
number, was the production of Mrs. Hicks, of Richmond; but whether she
be living or dead, is more than we know. If still living, as we trust she
is, the very novel form which Virginia has since assumed, might furnish a fresh
theme for her very clever pen. The Rev. Dr. Bethune, who died in Florence,
April 27, 1862, contributed the charming story of "Uncle Bernard,"
which appeared in the sixth number. This story had a very remarkable
adventure. It was appropriated by a London magazine, without any hint

<!-- ns vol 1 page 3 -->

being given of its origin, and republished here as original by one of our
own magazines, without any suspicion of its American authorship; thus furnishing
a very striking instance of the dangers encountered by literary pilferers in the
absence of an international copyright-law. The Rev. Dr. Baird, who contributed
an article on "Russia," which appeared in one of the early numbers, and which
attracted great attention at the time by the accuracy with which the events of the
war in the Crimea were predicted, died March 15, 1863. The Rev. J. H. Hanson
(author of the article in the second number, the title of which, "Have we a
Bourbon among us?" has passed into a proverb), as well as the subject of his
ingenious essays, the supposed Bourbon, are both among the dead. William S.
Thayer, one of the most promising and versatile of our younger brood of journalists,
who contributed to the first volume a review of "Lowell's Poems," in
conjunction with his friend and classmate, William Howland, died in Alexandria,
Egypt, where he was United States Consul, about 1864.</p>

<p>Our necrological record is painfully long. It shows how many eminent
names were on the list of our contributors, and how great a variety of talent
is necessary to sustain the interest of a monthly magazine. In addition to
those we have named, we can but briefly mention the names of others who
well deserve a special commemoration; and chief among them is Caroline M.
Kirkland, the vivacious, vigorous, genial, sensible, and erudite teacher and
writer, who died as truly in the cause of the Union, as any of the heroes who
gave their lives for their country on the battle-field; Richard Hildreth, the
historian, who died a year ago in Italy, whither he had gone as Consul to Trieste;
Henry W. Herbert, better known, perhaps, to American readers, as Frank Forrester,
grandson of the Earl of Pembroke, who, like William North, died by his own
hand; Prof. Charles W. Hackley, of Columbia College; Maj. E. B. Hunt, of the
United States Army; Lieut. Bleecker, of the United States Navy; Dr. J. R. Orton,
poet and novelist; Thomas Francis Meagher, who died Governor of Montana;
C. M. Webber; Calvin W. Philleo, author of "Stage-Coach Stories;" and
Maria Lowell, whose death was so tenderly commemorated by Longfellow, in the
exquisite poem entitled "The Two Angels."</p>

<p>There are others, who have strangely disappeared from the world of letters,
after letting their light shine for a brief while in the pages of the MONTHLY,
who, we trust, are still among the living. What has become of "Jack Lantern"
and his "railroad speculations?" Has he abandoned literature altogether
for the law? The author of that sparkling essay on the "Pacific Railroad,"
which appeared in the ninth and eleventh numbers, has no right to wrap
such talents as he possesses in a legal napkin. And what has become of
Dick Tinto, and the author of "What is the Use?" Has Jervis McEntee,
who once gave us such beautiful little landscapes in verse, entirely abandoned
the pen for the pencil? And where, let us ask, is Herman Melville? Has that
copious and imaginative author, who contributed so many brilliant articles to the
MONTHLY, let fall his pen just where its use might have been so remunerative to
himself, and so satisfactory to the public?</p>

<p>It is no small satisfaction to us to remember, that the MONTHLY first tempted
several neophytes in literature to come out before the public, who have remained
out to their own credit as well as to the public's satisfaction and profit. Among
them were William Swinton, the accomplished historian of the Army of the Potomac,
whose "Rambles among Verbs and Adjectives," which appeared in the
twenty-third and twenty-fourth numbers, were written while he was a teacher in
a school in North Carolina, and which he had to quit between two days to
avoid the inevitable consequences of being suspected of abolitionism. Then
there was Fred. B. Perkins, sufficiently well known now as a magazinist, whose
"Connecticut Georgics" appeared in the sixteenth, and "Conversations with
Miss Chester" in the twenty-sixth number. And Frederick S. Cozzens, the
genial author of the "Sparrowgrass Papers," which were commenced in the
twenty-fourth number.</p>

<p>Some remarkable volumes have been made up, too, from the early numbers
of the Monthly, among which were "Shakespeare's Scholar," by Richard
Grant White; Calvert's "Early Years in Europe;" Mackie's "Cosas de Espagna;"
Mr. Curtis' "Potiphar Papers" and "Prue and I;" "Political
Essays," by Parke Godwin; "The Sparrowgrass Papers," by F. S. Cozzens;

<!-- ns vol 1 page 4 -->

"Washington," by Mrs. C. M. Kirkland; "Fireside Travels," by J.
R. Lowell; "Twice Married," by C. W. Philleo; "Israel Potter," by Herman
Melville; "The Lost Prince," by Hanson; "Cape Cod," by H. D. Thoreau;
"Leaves from the Book of Nature," by Professor Schele de Vere;
"The Criterion," by H. T. Tuckerman, and "Wensley," by that accomplished
scholar and powerful writer, Edmund Quincy; besides the series of railroad
volumes known as "Maga Stories," "Maga Social Papers," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Can it with any justice be said, that a magazine which accomplished thus
much was not a success? And, if such a success could be achieved fourteen
years ago, is it at all unreasonable to anticipate less under the more favorable
conditions which invite a similar enterprise now? Past experience has
taught us many useful lessons, which we hope to turn to our advantage. We
know exactly what the public need in a magazine, and we hope to be able to
furnish it. Popular taste has not much changed. Fourteen years ago it was
considered an act of <i>hari-kari</i> for a popular periodical to express a political
opinion, particularly if it was adverse to the "peculiar institution" of the
South. But we ventured upon it without any harm coming of it, and we
shall probably try it again. Certainly, we have no desire to publish a magazine
for readers who are too feeble to endure a candid discussion, now-and-then,
of political subjects. Stories are the life of a magazine, we are aware.
One serial novel used to be considered sufficient for an English magazine; but
so great is the general craving for stories, that no magazine ventures now to
have less than two. Mrs. Todgers confessed, that the greatest difficulty in a
commercial boarding-house, was to furnish a sufficiency of gravy for her guests.
Stories are the gravy of a magazine, and this essential element to success shall
not be wanting. American readers are accustomed almost entirely to foreign
works of fiction; but we shall publish none but stories of native production.
It is not possible that such devourers of stories should be incapable of producing
the article so essential to their happiness. We have entire faith in our ability to
bring out the required supply of American novels and romances. Like the gold in
the gulches of the Rocky Mountains, they are only waiting for a little adventurous
prospecting to bring them to light.</p>

<p>Once more, then, PUTNAM'S MAGAZINE takes its position in the literary
firmament, with more "star-dust" in the atmosphere than there was at its
first appearance, and with more luminaries to diminish its light, perhaps, by
their superior brilliance.</p>

<p>Many excellent friends, who have favored us by their sage advice, have
strangely insisted that it will be useless to expect good contributions without
good pay; as though a publisher or an editor were likely to have missed this
special lesson in his dealings with authors. But there are two sides to this
interesting question of pay. In order that a publisher should pay, he must
himself be paid. One veteran author, by way of enforcing his views on this
subject, demanded a retaining fee of five hundred dollars as an earnest of future
payments, for whatever he might furnish. Experience has taught us, that in
magazine-writing the best-paid authors are by no means necessarily the best.
The young, fresh, vigorous, and original writers, who are yet unknown to fame,
and whose names have no commercial value, are the least expensive and the
most beneficial contributors to a magazine. We do not intend to delude the
public by paying for the use of a name. We shall publish no articles except for
their intrinsic merit, and shall always prefer a new writer to an old one.
None know better than our own authors what discouraging disadvantages the
publisher of an original American magazine must contend against, in being
obliged to compete with the unpaid British productions which are reproduced
here almost simultaneously with their publication on the other side of the Atlantic.
And while this unequal contest between the publisher who filches his matter,
and the one who pays for it, almost prohibits the possibility of profit to the latter,
the American author gauges his demand for compensation by the standard of
his English brother. But we are touching, perhaps, on private rights by these
allusions. The commercial value of any article depends upon what it will
bring in the open market, and by that test we must be governed in the question
of pay.</p>

<p>Something more we might add; but we cheerfully subside&mdash;to the reader's

<!-- ns vol 1 page 5 -->

gratification, no doubt, as well as our own&mdash;to give place to the following note
from our former coadjutor, GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.</p>

<p class="center">MR. CURTIS' LETTER.</p>

<p>MY DEAR BRIGGS:&mdash;One bright day long and long ago,&mdash;it seems to me now
that it must have been soon after the war of 1812, but, upon reflection, I discover
that it was in 1852&mdash;I was dining with Mr. Harry Franco at Windust's, in Park
Row. As we ate our simple repast and spoke of many things, Mr. Franco asked
me what I thought of the prospect of a new and wholly American magazine; and
immediately proceeded to set forth its possible character and brilliant promise so
fully and conclusively, that I knew he was prophesying, and that, before many
months, a ph&oelig;nix would appear. That was my earliest knowledge of PUTNAM'S
MONTHLY.</p>

<p>In the following Autumn, there was a little dinner at Mr. Publisher Putnam's
cosy Sixteenth-street house, and the details of the enterprise were discussed at
length. Mrs. Kirkland was there, and was, as usual, one of the most delightful of
companions. When something was said of "pure literature" and "the classics,"
her genial face beamed with suppressed fun, as she said:</p>

<p>"Oh! the classics? They are in great repute at Washington. When I was
there, last winter, a member of Congress sat beside me at dinner, and as he had
been told that I was a <i>littery</i> woman, he evidently resolved to make the most of
his opportunities; so, after a little while, he said to me:</p>

<p>" 'There's going to be a <i>lecter</i> to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>" 'Ah!' said I. 'Who is to lecture?'</p>

<p>" 'I disremember his name, but his subject,' said my neighbor slowly, to make
sure, 'is The Age of Pericles'&mdash;pronouncing the last syllable as in the word
miracles.</p>

<p>"My neighbor looked at me, as if he had not finished his remark, and repeated
the words contemplatively, 'The Age of Pericles.' Then, with a kind of appealing
expression, he suddenly asked me:</p>

<p>" 'What <i>are</i> Pericles?'&mdash;as if he supposed them to be a kind of shell-fish."</p>

<p>Of course, it had been long decided that the experiment of the magazine should
be tried. It is safe to suppose, when advice is asked, that a resolution has been
taken. When I arose from table at Windust's, on that long-vanished June
afternoon, I was as sure that there would be a magazine as if Mr. Franco had told
me that it was all in type; and now, after the other dinner in Sixteenth-street&mdash;for
it is a beautiful provision of nature, that literary enterprises of great pith and
moment should be matured under the benign influences of good eating and drinking&mdash;I
found myself consulting, in a bare room in a deserted house in Park Place,
where nobody could find us out, with Mr. Publisher Putnam, Mr. Harry Franco,
editor-in-chief, and Mr. Parke Godwin, associate editor, upon the first number of
PUTNAM'S MONTHLY.</p>

<p>We were an amiable triumvirate; and, although I say it, we put a great deal of
conscience into our work. Our council-chamber was a third-story front room in
a doomed house near to Mr. Putnam's headquarters, which were then in Park
Place. I say doomed house; for, although a comfortable and staunch building, it
was a dwelling-house, and as fashion had at last flown even from Park Place&mdash;the
spot below Bleecker-street where it lingered longest&mdash;the house was patiently waiting
to be demolished, and make way for a "store." Every day we met and looked
over manuscripts. How many there were! And how good! And what piles of
poetry! The country seemed to be an enormous nest of nightingales; or, perhaps,
mocking-birds&mdash;certainly cat-birds. I can see now the philosophic Godwin tenderly
opening a trembling sheet, traced with that feminine chirography so familiar to the
editorial eye, and in a hopeful voice beginning to read. After a very few lines a
voice is heard&mdash;methinks from Franco's chair: "Yes, yes; guess that's enough;"&mdash;Walter
di Montreal, thy hour has come, and the familiar chirography flutters
into the basket.</p>

<p>I suppose, my dear Briggs, you have long ago forgotten how many excellent
suggestions Mr. Franco made. His nimble wit, his experience, his instinct of the
popular taste, oiled all the dry and doubtful spots upon the ways, so that, when the

<!-- ns vol 1 page 6 -->

stays were knocked away, the good ship of our hopes and fears slid smoothly out,
and was at once launched in deep water. The Rev. Mr. Hanson brought his story
about the Rev. Eleazar Williams, as the lost Bourbon. Mr. Franco instantly suggested
the proper title, which has passed into current use, "Have we a Bourbon
among us?" One day, after the first number was made up, Mr. Franco said, in his
crisp way, "There must be an article upon the present state of parties, in the next
number." Thereupon, Godwin, who was our statesman and political thinker,
dropped his modest eyes; but Mr. Franco added, "I don't mean political parties;
I mean Brown's." Alas! it was in that manner that "our best society" was
described. The lovely maidens, whose exquisite draperies floated off Lyons looms;
the polished youth, who encircled them in the modest waltz of the German, what
time they placed bottles of champagne upon the floor beside their chairs for
refreshment&mdash;these were described as "Brown's society." The result of Mr.
Franco's hint was Mrs. Potiphar's first appearance. When she came out, it seems
that somebody spoke of her, and of the person who had written about her, to Mr.
Brown. "I don't know him," said Mr. Brown; and there was an end of that fine
fellow.</p>

<p>The paper upon the Bourbon excited a curious interest. The subject was
discussed every where, and, in very many minds, the question soon became, "<i>Haven't</i>
we a Bourbon among us?" One morning a message was sent up to the editorial
rooms from headquarters, that the Bourbon was then and there visible in the flesh.
Down we went, and found a tall, large-framed man, erect and portly, of a deep-bronze
hue, and of a bland expression. His hands were soft, like a Prince's or an
Indian's. The head was round, and receded from the forehead. The face was very
full, and was certainly very like the face of the Bourbon kings upon the <i>Louis d'ors</i>
of France. If he were not the Seventeenth Louis, there was no apparent reason
why he should not be. He was quite as royal a looking gentleman as any king of
his time; as mild of mien as his reputed father; and he undoubtedly led a much
better life at Green Bay than his illustrious predecessor, the grand monarch, or his
kinsman the Regent at Versailles. The reverend Prince died in 1858, and opinions
still differ whether he were a full-blooded Prince royal or a half-breed Indian.</p>

<p>In one of the earlier numbers of PUTNAM'S MONTHLY&mdash;that for July, 1853&mdash;there
is a letter "Number One" of Parepidemus. It is very short, only three pages, and
the really attentive and perceptive reader must have felt that it was by none of the
familiar writers of the magazine, and was both in a different vein and a different
spirit from the usual magazine literature. The last sentence was suggestive of a
foreign authorship: "Let me sign myself, my dear sir (as we are all 'strangers and
pilgrims,' so myself in an especial sense), your obliged and faithful Parepidemus."
The letter is a mere fragment, a brief expression of a divine doubt, a simple and
sincere questioning of the nature and result of intellectual and moral effort and
expression. One little characteristic sentence will reveal the writer to those who
know him, or who knew his works. He is speaking of something more than mere
self-relief in the work of the great artist, the high, inspired purpose, which may be
detected in St. Peter's or in the Tempest, and then adds: "Imperfect, no doubt,
both this and that is: short of the better thing to come&mdash;the thing that is. Yet
not impotent, not wholly unavailing."</p>

<p>Parepidemus was Arthur Hugh Clough, the young English scholar and poet,
whom Matthew Arnold mourns as sincerely as Milton mourned Lycidas, and whom
the whole younger generation of thoughtful, cultivated Englishmen remember with
affectionate regret, and deplore as a man whose remarkable powers should have
made him a leader of the best. He was born in England, and was early brought
to this country; then returned, and was one of the beloved scholars of Dr. Arnold
at Rugby, with Tom Hughes, Dean Stanley, Palgrave, and others; and went from
Rugby up to Oxford, and, as his companions all fondly believed, to still higher and
higher influence and honors. His powers were indisputable, his attainments remarkable,
and his character most lovely. But a conscience subtly sensitive, a mind
too exquisitely balanced, held him in the incessant unrest of the deepest moral and
intellectual inquiry. He had the ambition which is part of the dowry of genius.
He knew, and valued, and desired the prizes in the career for which he was fitted.
But something restrained his hand: "Ought I to take the crown?" he asked, as
if unworthy, as if his title were not perfect, as if the very desire were a deceit; and
while he asked, the crown grew shadowy and faded away. One little poem,

<!-- ns vol 1 page 7 -->

printed originally in the very thin volume of his verses, which every owner dearly
prizes, I will transcribe here, as singularly expressive of him:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"I have seen higher, holier things than these,<br/>

And therefore must to these refuse my heart;<br/>

Yet I am panting for a little ease;<br/>

I'll take, and so depart.</p>

<p>Ah, hold? The heart is prone to fall away,<br/>

Her high and cherished visions to forget,<br/>

And, if thou takest, how wilt thou repay<br/>

So vast, so dread a debt?</p>

<p>How will the heart, which now thou trustest, then<br/>

Corrupt, yet in corruption mindful yet,<br/>

Turn with sharp stings upon itself! Again<br/>

Bethink thee of the debt!</p>

<p>&mdash;Hast thou seen higher, holier things than these,<br/>

And therefore must to these thy heart refuse?<br/>

With the true best, alack! how ill agrees<br/>

The best that thou wouldst choose!</p>

<p>The Summum Pulchrum rests in heaven above;<br/>

Do thou, as best thou may'st, thy duty do;<br/>

Amid the things allowed thee, live and love;<br/>

Some day thou shalt it view."</p>

</div>

<p>Clough came to this country in 1852, with the intention of taking pupils in the
higher studies, and lived at Cambridge. He was greatly beloved by those who
knew best the rare qualities of his genius, and his friendships were with the best
men and women. There was an attractive blending of scholarly shyness, melancholy,
and geniality in the impression he made; and he had the fullest sympathy
with the freedom and the promise of American life. But his sad self was relentless.
He could not escape the old wonder and questioning. What he wrote in poetry
and prose had a strain of sincere, child-like pathos, wholly unsurpassed in contemporary
literature. And it characterizes all his writings. It is not a pathos of sighs
and sobs, and elegiac weeping and wailing, but a melancholy like that of the
Autumn in Nature, a primeval sadness. It was while he was in Cambridge that he
wrote the two letters of Parepidemus, the second of which appeared in the August
number of 1853. But he soon went back to England; was appointed to a position
in the education department of the Privy Council; married; worked hard, and in
1859 finished a translation of Plutarch. In 1861 he was obliged to relinquish
work; went to Greece and Constantinople; returned, and wandered about Europe,
reaching Florence in the Autumn. There he died on the 13th of November, 1861,
and there he lies buried under the beautiful cypresses of the Protestant cemetery.
Since his death, many of his letters and his manuscript poems have been
privately printed in England, and an edition of the poems that he had already
printed was published soon after his death. Clough's particular friend in this
country was Charles Eliot Norton, of Cambridge, who edited a beautiful edition of
his poems, which was published by Ticknor &amp; Fields, in 1862. Mr. Norton prefaced
them with a tender and modest memoir, and from that and an article by
him in the <i>North American Review</i> for October, 1867, upon the privately printed
volume, a very accurate impression of the rare and lovely genius of Clough may be
obtained. His name is not yet very familiar in English literature, but it yearly
becomes more so. His life seemed, of course, to many, a failure; but the union of
real sincerity with real power never fails, however tardy be its recognition. It is
refreshing to think of the antique nobility of soul, the true simplicity, the unshrinking
devotion to the most celestial ideal, the patience, humility, and unselfishness
of this thoroughly trained scholar and this true poet. A photograph of Clough
hangs in Norton's study. It is a broad, balanced, serene, massive head, full of
sweetness and wisdom, and of the child-like simplicity of modest genius. If I
think of the pleasant and various society of our contributors, those who are living
still, and those who are dead, there is no figure more significant and impressive,
however modest and shadowy, and unknown to his companions, than that of
Clough.</p>

<p>I suppose that Mr. Franco and Godwin, and the poor fellow who was snuffed
out by Mr. Brown's brief remark, might fill many pages with their recollections
of the pleasant cradle-and-crib days of the young "PUTNAM." Those three

<!-- ns vol 1 page 8 -->

were the MONTHLY nurses. They saw that infant phenomenon safely through his
prodigious childhood, and how rapidly he obtained his growth!</p>

<p>There are books in good standing, every where, which I can never see but with
the feeling of the pedagogue towards his pupils, who have become illustrious.
"<i>My</i> boys, sir; <i>my</i> boys!" he remarks with complacency, as the famous poets, or
travellers, or novelists pass by. "Our books, sir; our books!" say the old triumvirate
of "PUTNAM," as they hear the praises of the works, the manuscripts of which
they luckily did not reject. Reject? I should say not. "I knew ye, Hal!" Their
shrewd wits detected the signs at once, and saluted the genius unaided. And
what editor ever does "reject" a manuscript? "Ladies, or fair ladies, I would
wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you, not to fear, not to
tremble," but to understand that when your manuscript returns, it is not because
of any judgment upon its merits. Heaven forefend! It is only that, although
nothing could be more, etc., etc., yet it is not exactly suitable to the pages of this
magazine, and is, therefore, respectfully returned, or declined, with thanks. It is
merely that this is a red rose&mdash;and very beautiful it is!&mdash;where a white lily was
wanted. The enclosed pearl is returned with the most sincere thanks, because it
was an opal which was needed to complete the necklace.</p>

<p>This, as we know, was the spirit of the original triumvirate of PUTNAM'S
MONTHLY; and this, we are very sure (are we not?), will be the spirit of its
more modern management. More modern? We, then, are ancient! Among the
fresh voices which now swell the blithe choir of our literature, we are as those
who have come down from a former generation! How this latest-born into the
Monthly world springs and sparkles! Ah! Mr. Franco, if it is not our child, let
us submit, and believe it to be our grandchild. I seem to recognize our family
likeness. Methinks I detect the air of the "PUTNAM" of long ago. May Heaven
bless you, young stranger! May you live long and happily! Forgive an old-fashioned
benediction, but may you be a better man than your father!</p>

<p>So prays, dear Briggs, your affectionate grandf&mdash;&mdash;,<br/>

I mean, faithful friend,<br/>

GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.</p>
