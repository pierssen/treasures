<p>I also located a printed copy of <a href="https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/permalink/01UCD_INST/13iosf5/alma990027241280403126"><i>My Century Plant</i></a> at UC Davis 
and was able to order <a href="http://www.pierssen.com/misc/treasures/mcp/mcp_ucd_scans.pdf">scans</a> of the following pages:</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI:</p>

<ul>

<li>p. 134: but do urge [open and full investigation, and such instruction for the young, that] such mistakes</li>

</ul>

<p>CHAPTER XII</p>

<ul>

<li>p. 147: to try to make [things as] they should be. [In reply to] the above question</li>

</ul>

<p>CHAPTER XIII:</p>

<ul>

<li>p. 148:  a bright, winsome [little thing.] They purchased copies of such of my books as I had with [me, and soon after a younger,] an unmarried man came up to whom I was [introduced]</li>

</ul>

<p>CHAPTER XIV:</p>

<ul>

<li>p. 157: are [born] with desire in the ascendancy, not subject to the control [of the spiritual by] a law of their nature, but must come into that condition [through such] suffering as brings growth.</li>

<li>p. 158: carrying each part in [my head till, if all had been represented] on my pillow</li>

<li>p. 159: Give to woman the freedom here [demanded for her, and she] will find [the balance. The woman] who has not grown large enough to feel her chains</li>

<li>p. 160: filled with rottenness that [pollutes both] soil and air; for, as the same writer says: "There is [no medication which] will do good when administered to mere results."</li>

</ul>
