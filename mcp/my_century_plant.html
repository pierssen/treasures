<p>TO THE READER.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I am well aware that the demand here made for woman
will be accepted by but few: but truth when once born
into human consciousness will finally do its work, no matter how
received at first. I do not expect the great world to
heed such a demand yet awhile, but the truth involved is
here&mdash;and to stay till the voice of arbitrary authority is no
longer heard, and Woman's Love, redeems the world.</p>

<p>The following poem by Charlotte Perkins Stetson is selected
for its appropriateness. It make me feel that I am
not alone in my demand for the mothers of men.</p>

<p>A CALL TO MOTHERS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza">In the name of your ages of anguish!
In the name of the curse and the stain,
By the strength of your sorrow I call you!
By the power of your pain!</p>

<p class="stanza">We are mothers. Through us in our bondage,
Through us with a brand in the face,
Be we fettered with gold or with iron,
Through us comes the race!</p>

<p class="stanza">With the weight of all sin our shoulders,
Midst the serpents of shame ever curled,
We have sat unresisting, defenseless,&mdash;
Making the men of the world!</p>

<!-- page iv -->

<p class="stanza">We were ignorant long, and our children
Were besotted and brutish and blind;
King driven, priest-ridden,&mdash;who are they?
Our children&mdash;mankind.</p>

<p class="stanza">We were kept for our beauty, our softness,
Our sex,&mdash;what reward do ye find?
We transmit, must transmit, being mothers,
What we are to mankind.</p>

<p class="stanza">As the mother, so follow the children!
No nation, wise, noble and brave
Ever sprang,&mdash;though the father had freedom,
From the mother,&mdash;a slave!</p>

<p class="stanza">Look now at the world as ye find it!
Blench not! Truth is kinder than lies!
Look now at the world&mdash;see it suffer&mdash;
Listen now to its cries!</p>

<p class="stanza">See the people who suffer, all people!
All humanity wasting its powers
In a hand to hand struggle&mdash;death-dealing&mdash;
All children of ours!</p>

<p class="stanza">The blind millionaire&mdash;the blind harlot&mdash;
The blind preacher leading the blind&mdash;
Only think of their pain, how it hurts them
Our little blind babies&mdash;mankind!</p>

<p class="stanza">Shall we bear it? We mothers who love them?
Can we bear it? We mothers who feel
Every pang of our babes and forgive them
Every sin when they kneel?</p>

<!-- page v -->

<p class="stanza">Little stumbling world! You have fallen!
You are crying in darkness and fear;
Wait darling&mdash;your mother is coming!
Hush darling&mdash;your mother is here!</p>

<p class="stanza">We are here like an army with banners&mdash;
The great flag of our freedom unfurled,
With us rests the fate of the nations,
For we make the world!</p>

<p class="stanza">Dare ye sleep while your children are calling?
Dare ye wait while they clamor unfed?
Dare ye pray in the proud pillared churches?
While they suffer for bread?</p>

<p class="stanza">If the father hath sinned he shall answer,
If he check thee laugh back at his powers;
Shall a mother be kept from her children?
These people are ours!</p>

<p class="stanza">They are ours. He is ours for we made him.
In our arms he has nestled and smiled;
Shall we, the world-mothers be hindered
By the freaks of a child?</p>

<p class="stanza">Rise now in the power of The Woman,
Rise now in the hour of our need,
The world cries in hunger and darkness,
We shall light! We shall feed!</p>

<p class="stanza">In the name of our ages of anguish,
In the name of the curse and the stain,
By the strength of our sorrow we conquer,
In the power of our pain!</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>"Why Marion, how can you talk like that! I never
expected to hear you advocating prostitution."</p>

<p>"That is just what I do not advocate, Lucy. I want
to see all forms of prostitution, and especially sex prostitution,
wiped out, not only from the practice, but from the
minds of the people."</p>

<p>"It seems to me a strange way of doing so, claiming
that a woman has the right to dispose of her person without
sanction of law or priest."</p>

<p>"I do claim just that, but intelligent self-ownership is
not prostitution. I am not talking of a weak yielding to a
man's wishes nor to one's own. No, not that; no really intelligent
woman who has thought upon this question till she
understands her inherent right to herself can be seduced,
coaxed into yielding. She will act freely or not at all."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I must say I cannot understand you in the
least. It seems to me that one who deliberately takes a
step in the wrong direction is worse than one who is coaxed
into so doing."</p>

<p>"I am not talking of taking a step in the wrong direction
but of one who dares to take a step she sees to be right
even if others think it wrong. Such a woman is a strong

<!-- page 10 -->

and if virtue means strength, a virtuous one, while one who
can be coaxed into doing what she believes to be wrong
is a very weak woman, has not the strength of virtue."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that any woman can take such a step
without degrading herself, and Marion, sister, I would rather
see you in your coffin than to see you doing so."</p>

<p>Marion Crawford sighed. "It is one thing to see the
right and another thing to be strong enough to live it," she
said. "The way lies between Scylla and Charybdis and
few dare the perilous passage."</p>

</div>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The closing words of the last speaker give voice
to the feelings with which I enter upon the work before
me. It is indeed sailing between Scylla and Charybdis,
but still I feel impelled to venture. To so portray the
straight and narrow path that the many instead
of the "few" may find and walk therein is a
work for which the ages have waited. It is; it can
be found, and woman must find it. It is her work.</p>

<p>The way that leads to the heights is steep; the
rocks are slippery and the depths are below, but the
path once made plain, each traveller will place a stepping
stone or remove an obstruction, even till one can
walk and not become weary, can run if there be need
for running.</p>

<p>If re-incarnation be a truth. If I am what I am
told I am by those on the other side of life, then:
"For this cause came I into the world," came to declare
the truth I see, leaving it to do its own work
while I go&mdash;home&mdash;go to those I knew and loved in
a previous state of existence.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly understood then by those who
read these pages that in the name of eternal justice,

<!-- page 11 -->

in the name of the law of genuine progress, I demand
for woman the full right to her own person and such
respect from all men that no man will think of approaching
her only as she indicates her pleasure; and
I further demand that all the movements of the machine
called society be so adjusted as to secure such
freedom together with all that it involves!</p>

<p>As will be seen, I neither base my claim nor the
method of its application upon what is, but upon
what should be; or rather, said claim is based upon
the law of natural right, and the demand for such
a re-adjustment of society as will secure to woman
such freedom, is based upon the paramount importance
of her work for the race, a work which she
cannot rightly perform if subject to, or dependent
upon another for the needed conditions.</p>

<p>I am aware that to most people this will seem an
astonishing and absurd demand, but to me it is self-evident
that Nature, not being a fool, would not
put her highest work, that upon which the greatest
unfoldment of the race depends, into the keeping of
an inferior, and if not inferior why a subject? Oh,
woman needs protection, is the plea. Well, protect
her; no one objects to that if needing it; protect her
with your strength, your manhood, but do this for
her as a free woman and not as a present or possible
property. Protect her&mdash;from what? Why, from
men, from yourselves. She needs only that.</p>

<p>Yes, the greatest possible work in the higher evolution
of the race is, by Nature's law, woman's. She
gives to the nations the bodies and brains through
which souls and intellects must act, all nourished by,

<!-- page 12 -->

drawn from her heart's blood. The portion furnished
by man is so small that the eye needs the aid of the
microscope to discover it, and even then there is a
difference of opinion as to whether it is the real germ
or a concentrated food, a potent element quickening
the true germ into life. Oh the assurance of man
in the face of such facts in claiming the child as his!
Had not woman first been enslaved this could never
have been done.</p>

<p>In virtue of woman's power in maternity, in virtue
of the fact that said power is a blessing or a curse
both to the child and community, as conditions shall
decide, she has the right, not only to the control of
her own person, but that such conditions be secured
to her as will enable her to be independent of the individual
man for the support of herself and children
even though said man be her chosen companion and
the father of her children. To be dependent upon
another for support makes one subject to that other's
will, and woman, if so subjected, cannot do her best
work for the race.</p>

<p>It matters not what any God is supposed to have
commanded, nor what Moses, Paul, or any, or all
other men may say or think, not until woman has
such freedom, not till society recognizes her right to
herself as the evolver of human life shall we as a race
actualize the ideal of the ages.</p>

<p>Those who do not see what such freedom for woman
really means will begin to imagine this, that
and the other evil result as they compare such change
with what now is. That will not do; it is not
just to the demand made. That demand calls for

<!-- page 13 -->

re-adjustment of society which will admit of such
freedom. That it cannot be under the present system
is very evident. But we can do this much&mdash;we
can show the paramount importance of woman's
work, we can point to the evils that result from her
enslavement; we can prepare the way, and if a century
hence the plant I now commit to the mental soil
becomes well rooted, the result will be assured.</p>

<p>Yes, entire freedom for woman&mdash;not the average
woman of to-day, not those who have been demoralized
by their enslaved condition under man's rule, but
women born of intelligent, self-respecting mothers in
whose hearts the consciousness of this natural right
has been awakened&mdash;women who were gestated from
blood made hot from a sense of wrong, aye, such a
generation of women will be strong to demand their
rights, rights which the men so gestated will gladly
accord.</p>

<p>This idea of woman's freedom is not new. The
eternal verities find expression all though the ages,
often spoken by lips entirely unconscious of the deep
significance of the words uttered. When Abraham
was told that the son of the bond (bound) woman
should not be heir with the son of the free woman, it
simply means, translated into modern language, that
Isaac was the legal heir. But St. Paul tells us that
this is an allegory, means more than a mere personal
matter. Treating it as such it means to me much
more than Paul expresses.</p>

<p>As I read Nature's law, a woman bound, crippled
of her powers by poverty, ignorance, outside
authority&mdash;such a woman cannot give birth to one

<!-- page 14 -->

capable of entering into, appreciating, enjoying his
or her rightful inheritance&mdash;the grand possibilities of
manhood and womanhood which, touching the very
soul of things, make life a perpetual joy. The text
says, shall not; Nature says, cannot. If one should
say of a man without feet, he shall not walk, or of a
man without eyes he shall not see, the absurdity would
be apparent. It is just as absurd to say of one
who has no musical talent, he shall not sing, or of one
who is badly dyspeptic, he shall not enjoy food. Can
not is the right word; there is no 'shall not' from any
outside power to prevent the fullest enjoyment of all
that is; the deficiency is in ourselves. And so of
moral deficiencies, there is no outside power other
than what man uses in his blindness, to punish one
more than the other.</p>

<p>As I read this text and interpret its allegorical
meaning I find it expressing the certain fact of woman's
ultimate and absolute freedom from whatever
tends to hinder her work as mother, or as the evolver
of the soul life of the race; and coupled with that
other text: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the
serpent's head," the significance is doubly apparent;
though I opine that the second "the" is an interpolation
to make the text fit the dogma that Jesus is the
seed spoken of, for why should this saying be held
as personal and the other not. Drop that one word
and the passage harmonizes with the idea of woman's
freedom, is a prophecy of its coming.</p>

<p>How can it be otherwise and the hopes of the
race be actualized. Soul longings and Nature's protests
are both assurances of what is yet to be. The

<!-- page 15 -->

all-pervading Soul is too wise to protest against that
which cannot be remedied, therefore every protest
that comes from nature through the soul of man or
woman, against what is, every effort to better things
is a prophecy of what is to come when the needed
steps are taken. One illustration:</p>

<p>Why the natural, the almost universal dislike of
children to stepmothers?</p>

<p>It is Nature's protest against the ignorance, the
false conditions which take a mother out of life or
from her children while they need her. It is the still,
small, but ever persistent voice which says: There
is no need that mothers should die thus, and when
you learn to live right they will not.</p>

<p>There is not a single protest thus made and persisted
in from generation to generation and from age
to age but what is equally significant. What then of
all these ages of violated womanhood&mdash;woman, the
mother of man and yet never the owner of her own
person&mdash;what of the protest against this state of
things till, in spite of every effort made to suppress
it, the demand for unqualified self-ownership is fearlessly
made. Surely, there is meaning in all this.</p>

<p>Indeed there is, though few as yet dare to speak
out, while the many will persecute these and repudiate
such ultimate outcome; yet time will show that
the "Woman movement" of the last half century
means more than the ballot; it means more than an
equal right with man in all the pursuits of life. It
means an entire reconstruction of society. It means
a system in which the motive powers to action shall
be brought to bear upon the moral instead of upon
the selfish elements of character.</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>It means a state of society in which human beings
shall be considered of more value than property,
and knowledge of how to improve our kind of greater
importance than that which teaches us how to improve
animals, and not as now that government shall
spend money to aid in improving the latter while
imprisoning men and women who devote themselves
to the former.</p>

<p>It means a state of society in which all that tends
to the physical, mental and moral welfare of gestating
mothers shall be considered of more value than
bank accounts, palaces, cathedrals or any other manifestation
of place or power held at the expense of the
people. In a word, it means a state of society which
will give us divine motherhood, and that such motherhood
must be free seems to me self-evident. The
idea that divinity, or the channel through which it
must come if at all, must be subject to man-made law-measurement
is simply absurd. Yes, I know they
claim divine authority for their enactments but: "by
their fruits ye shall know," and the results do not
sustain the claim.</p>

<p>But I am not done with bible quotations. Jesus
is recorded as saying: "In that world they neither
marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels
in heaven," and he taught his followers to pray
for the same state of things upon earth. I know that
those who have mistaken "the beauty of holiness"
or wholeness have imagined this to mean the end of
sex association, but nature and science tell a different
story, demonstrate that there can be no wholeness
without the interchange of the two great factors of
life universal.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>But there is another and a very vivid allegory
bearing on this question which can be found in Revelations,
that of the woman clothed with the sun and
the moon under her feet. No longer sitting in the
shadow of a reflected light, moonlight, but clothed
with the sun, with direct power. The child which
she is to bring forth is to rule the nations with a
rod of iron, a male child a positive element, made
such by the transition struggle. This allegorical
child, this positive spirit born of a sense of wrong,
will do more than rule. Its "rod of iron" will be
heavy enough to break in pieces the institutions that
stand in the path of true motherhood, for only as thus
broken can they be so reorganized as to harmonize
with the spirit of mother love, love that then need
never more be nailed to the cross of agony because of
badly born children.</p>

<p>Oh, those children! that are taken by their fathers
and locked up in prisons or, being weak, unbalanced,
become inmates of asylums that will not be needed
when woman is fully free; for, when thus free there
will be no unwilling motherhood and the free, glad
relation with all the conditions harmoniously adjusted
will bring to no mother's arms a badly organized
child. Obey Nature's law and she will do her part.</p>

<p>So much for bible allegories, but the student of
Nature has no need of them to prove woman's claim,
and they are not quoted here simply because found
in the bible but because they shadow forth what hereditary
law confirms. But for such confirmation
they would be of no value, no matter where found.
The time is past when thinkers can be held by any
"Thus saith the Lord."</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">MY JUSTIFICATION.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">I demand unqualified freedom for woman <i>as woman</i>,
and that all the institutions of society be adjusted to such
freedom.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Thousands will start up horror struck at the very
idea, will ask how it is possible I can justify myself
in making a demand so opposed to the laws of both
God and man.</p>

<p>In reply, I will say first: I recognize no God who
gives personal commands. As fast as I can understand
them I aim to obey the laws of Nature&mdash;these,
to me, are the methods of the Infinite manifestation,
and I acknowledge the authority of no other. These
are the laws self-existent in the very constitution of
things; consequently, seeing the law which makes the
full freedom of woman necessary to the highest good
of the race I could not justify myself if I did not declare
it. I am therefore justified in making such a
demand because of the good which must result from
the fulfillment of the conditions which will make
the realization of such demand possible.</p>

<p>"What," continues the objector, "good to come
from such lawlessness!"</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>You mistake, my friend; not lawlessness but statutelessness.
Law is uncreate, eternal; its authority is
absolute, it is unchangeable in its demands, makes no
concessions, grants no pardons; obey and command
its services; disobey and take the consequences. Such
is ever the language of law, and in this certainty lies
our hope of progress. Statutes are the rules that
men make for others to walk by. Genuine obedience
ever disregards them, in spirit at least, whenever
they come in contact with law.</p>

<p>As to the good that will, must come through the
full freedom of woman I would ask first: Would it
not be a great good if all sexual disease could be eliminated
from the blood of the race? Why do human
beings have such disease? We do not find anything
like it in the animal races and why in the human?
With the animals the female is free. If woman was
free, if she never received the creative embrace only
when she desired and from whom she desired the human
would not be thus afflicted.</p>

<p>I have questioned physicians upon this point,
and I have questioned others; I have yet to find the
first one to dissent from the position taken. I do not
believe an intelligent physician can be found who will
not give his assent to the proposition if so questioned
as not to arouse a fear that his business will suffer in
consequence, for sex disease furnishes the profession
a great deal of that upon which the bread and butter
depends. Yes, it would be a sad time for the
doctors till they became adjusted to the new order,
were sex disease wiped out. but think of what it
would be to the race. This one result of woman's

<!-- page 20 -->

full freedom, a result which cannot well be disputed,
is of itself a warrant for such freedom, an abundant
justification for demanding it.</p>

<p>I will state the proposition again: "If woman
ever received the sexual embrace only when she
desired and from whom she desired sexual disease
would be unknown." My reason for this is: harmony
is health, and in such case there would be no conflict
between the parties.</p>

<p>That sexual disease is a widespread and terrible
evil is too well known to be questioned. It is the prevailing
curse of all civilized lands. As an illustration
of its prevalence in our large cities, I take the following
from an address by E. H. Benn before the Society
of Medical Jurisprudence in New York the date of
which meeting I neglected to take. He says:</p>

<p class="small">"Within a few days past I have seen some statistics
of the diseases caused by public prostitution in New York
City and Kings County in 1857, when the population of this
city was less than 700,000, and that of Brooklyn much less
than it is now; and I was surprised to learn that in that
year 14,770 persons were treated in the public institutions
of New York City and King's County for syphilis. That
is, or was, estimated to be about one fourth of the number
treated in private practice, thus making about 74,000 patients
for that terrible disease in these two cities in a single
year, when the population was less than half it is now.
When we consider that this disease is hereditary, and is
transmitted from parent to child, and that this sin of the
parents is visited upon the children, not only to the third
and fourth generations, but far beyond that, we get some
idea of the magnitude of this evil in one aspect of the case."</p>

<p>Mr. Benn could find no statistics taken since then.

<!-- page 21 -->

What is the matter? Was the result so alarming
they dare not follow up their statistic taking? If
neglecting to tabulate them did away with the facts it
would be well to do so, but ignoring an evil does not
cure it. Stop and consider, please. The same rate
with the same population would make the summing
up from then till now to be nearly three million cases,
and with the increase of population four million
would fall considerably short of the actual number of
cases treated in those two cities alone in less than
forty years for this one terrible disease. Worse than
several wars, for those killed in war do not continue
from year to year to poison the blood of the coming
generations.</p>

<p>Oh mothers of the race, your children are perishing!
They stretch their hands to you for help, and
where should a child go but to its mother!</p>

<p>Yes, you will help if you can only find the how;
then let us study the problem together; let us ask our
sons what they have to show for all this to justify
such control of woman's person as we now have;
is there anything? Are not things even worse in other
respects than they would have been with woman
free? But our opponents are not so easily satisfied
that sex disease is the result of unwilling relations;
they urge that it is promiscuity, uncleanness, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, uncleanness, and I will explain how after a
little. Indeed, the following extract taken from the
124th page of the "Occult Forces of Sex" is ample
explanation, and I will add: I know the statement
made to be correct, for I was with the lady during
that winter.</p>

<!-- page 22 -->

<div class="small">

<p>"I once knew of a child being killed in the womb because
of the mother's strong repugnance to a physician.
There were two in the place; one she liked; the other she
very much disliked. Travail pains came on and the doctor
was sent for; the one wanted was out of town and the other
was brought. The thought of having him near her caused
such a revulsion of feeling that all pain ceased and did not
return for a week. The physician the lady wanted was
there when the child was born but it was born dead, and to
all appearance had been dead a week.</p>

<p>"If the thought of having the man she so disliked
near her as a physician produced such a result, suppose she
had felt obliged to receive him as a husband would there
not have been a conflict between her sex forces and his, a
conflict causing the death of at least a portion of the living
creatures involved? Would not the dead elements, the
physical covering of the life thus slain, create uncleanness?
Now take the case of the woman who has no other means
of gaining her bread, one who must suffer the infliction of
not only one but many. In such case there would be not
only the woman to be considered, but there would naturally
be a conflict between the different male elements as they
come in contact. Can we wonder that such conditions
produce disease?"</p>

</div>

<p>But the objector is not yet satisfied. "Why," he
asks, "if it is the conflict of forces that produces this
disease, why is it not produced between dissatisfied
married couples who live true to the letter of the law?
Myriads of women have submitted all their lives to
relations as distasteful as the one you have supposed,
have done so because they have been taught they
must, but who ever heard of a case of syphilis being
thus generated?"</p>

<p>Not a distinct case perhaps, but there is more
than one kind of sex disease that does not go by that

<!-- page 23 -->

name, and who ever heard of a woman so situated
who was really well? If all the weakness, the suffering
caused to woman because of undesired sex relations
could cease, the army of "General Debility" so
often spoken of, would be nearly or quite annihilated&mdash;yes,
I know&mdash;young women are unhealthy too;
the mothers have had 'sour grapes' forced upon them
and the daughters suffer. I maintain my position;
harmony is health; woman entirely free, and all the
conditions of society adjusted to said freedom, there
would be no conflicting relations, consequently, sex
disease would be unknown.</p>

<p>This would be more than either law, religion, or
the doctors have been able to accomplish. Why then
perpetuate the slavery of woman when our best physicians
claim that not one family in ten is free from
syphilitic taint, and our best writers assert that there
is more prostitution inside of marriage than out?
Why demand the old standard, the old order of
things at such a cost? Remember, please, that the
happiness of woman is the true basis for the happiness
of all, and relieved forever from the unwelcome
embrace an amount of personal misery would be removed
which of itself would be ample compensation
for the change.</p>

<p>Seeing as I do the immense good that would accrue
to the race from such freedom, I dare not be silent.
I could not justify myself to myself if I were.
Right here some highly sexed man says:</p>

<p>"But what of our suffering? This 'devilish intensity
of sex desire' would drive us mad; why should
we have it if we may not satisfy it?'</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>Do you wish to satisfy it at woman's expense?
There is where you make your mistake. It is now
that you are deprived of legitimate satisfaction. Irresponsive
relations give temporary relief but do not
satisfy; they cannot; they only deplete, and thus the
'intensity' is increased till in your desperation you destroy
the wife or go elsewhere; often both. What you
need to <i>satisfy</i> is the love element, the fine soul sex
life of woman to blend with your own. This you can
not force from her. No bound woman, no bought woman
can satisfy that intense need of yours. Only
in freedom, absolute, unquestioned freedom, can woman
bestow her best upon man, and such freedom
she has never had. No attempted enforcement of an
arbitrary morality,&mdash;no thus saith the Lord, nor thus
saith the law can suppress or direct this master passion.
It must be satisfied. It never has been only in
part, and it never can be only in part till woman is
entirely free; so for your sakes, my brothers, I am
justified in making my demand.</p>

<p>The general idea of a free woman, is a public
woman. It is not strange then, that the demand for
the freedom of all women should be looked upon with
horror. The mind must be disabused of this idea.
A public woman is not free. The term signifies for
public use. A free woman&mdash;one free in the true sense
of the term, is not and never can be <i>for use</i>. She
is the equal partner of creative life be that life physical,
mental, spiritual, or all three combined, and never
can life so blended create disease.</p>

<p>This one great law of health is ample justification
for the demand that woman shall be free, and that all

<!-- page 25 -->

the institutions of society be made conformable to
said demand. True, the struggle will be great. It
cannot well be otherwise; but consider for a moment,
please, what has been, what loss of life and property
to maintain national honor, to preserve an unsullied
flag, and then ask which is of the most importance, a
people's flag or a people's health?</p>

<p>But health is not the only blessing which will result
from freedom for woman. Her children will become
heirs of all there is or can be&mdash;this of the final
result, and not of the inevitably imperfect first fruits
of the transition period. But even these will be of a
much higher average than what we now have, while
with woman enslaved we can hope for nothing better.</p>

<p>The free woman will, must feel the responsibility
of her position. The education which will enable
her to understand that responsibility will be a part of
her freedom inheritance. She will know that only as
she makes the most of herself can she transmit the
best to her children. She will not as now, be weary
and worn, for all things will contribute to her work.</p>

<p>Science has discovered that the vibrations of the
voice upon the atmosphere produce corresponding
figures, flowers, serpents, etc., as is the character of
the feeling behind it. Having this knowledge, think
you that the institutions adjusted to woman's freedom
would permit such sights and sounds as we now have,
sights and sounds that become a part of the character
of the next generation. Knowing this, woman will
demand that all the influences brought to bear upon
gestating mothers are of a nature to call out the best
elements of character, and how much does this involve,

<!-- page 26 -->

what changes from the now? Space would
fail me to enumerate the evils that would be thus
forever banished.</p>

<p>The complementing blessing would be well born
children, healthy, happy, loving children. All that is
desirable as to bodily, health, personal appearance,
mental balance, moral dignity, and spiritual power
will be the inheritance of the children of the free woman&mdash;the
mother's joy, the father's pride, and a surety
of a noble manhood and womanhood.</p>

<p>Hark, the crash!&mdash;all prison walls have fallen&mdash;another!&mdash;asylums
are no more&mdash;not needed. Fortresses,
guns, swords, bayonets, cannons are no longer
required; armies disband; the soldier becomes the
glad lover, the proud father&mdash;justification enough,
surely! not now accorded, but I can wait.</p>

<p>But the greatest good to result from woman's
freedom will come through the action of the spiritual
forces which will be thus set in motion. It is because
the spiritual has been shut from the material expression
of the love life that we have so much of disease
and death. Spirit not only 'giveth life' but it is spirit
that preserves, perpetuates it. The soul life, which
is the road for spirit to the realm of matter, cannot act
through unwilling sex relations, and thus cannot <i>generate</i>
spiritual life for the race. There can be no redemption
till love is unchained and the spiritual recognized
in the sex relation.</p>

<p>Protestants repudiate the idea of a middle state of
existence. They in theory send us at the death of the
body directly to heaven or hell, (what a host must be
coming up from hell on the judgment day) but Catholics

<!-- page 27 -->

have their purgatory in which souls must suffer
till helped out. Spiritualists, believing that things are
as natural there as here, recognize different grades of
growth and the law of progress in spirit life. They
claim that ignorant or vicious spirits may, through
the law of growth, reach a better, happier state of existence.
There is truth here. Catholics and Spiritualists
both sense it, but I question if the law of that
purgatory, the how of that growth, has been perceived
by either.</p>

<p>Further on I will try to elaborate this law as I see
it, but here I will only say that the full freedom of
woman is not only a necessity to the redemption of
the material side of our earth life, but also to the
renovation of those darkened spirit spheres which
pertain to, are a part of this planet.</p>

<p>In a book written in the interest of Theosophy
one of their wise ones, a Mahatma, says:</p>

<p class="small">Throughout all past ages one fatal thought has vitiated
every attempt of man on this planet to establish a civilized
state. On some other planets, in this, and in greater
systems of worlds, larger truth was earlier given. This destroying
thought has been the wrong interpretation of sex.
The male has assumed that he was the lord of life, whereas
the opposite fact is nearer the truth; if there is any distinction
the female element of nature is the higher. Man
by this false assumption has brought repeated ruin upon all
his attempts to build a lasting civilization.</p>

<p>If the idea of man's supremacy has been a fatal
one, if it has destroyed the civilizations of the
past, it is surely time that woman came to the front.
It is time she was free, so far at least as her person
is concerned. And as the civilizations which have

<!-- page 28 -->

failed and are failing, were and are suited to woman's
sex slavery, it follows as a matter of course that
there must be new institutions in which there will be
no obstacle to her entire freedom.</p>

<p>Is not a perception of the law through which a
civilization can be evolved that will last, a civilization
the influence of which will extend to the lower
spheres of spirit life as an uplifting power&mdash;is not the
perception of such a law not only a justification for
the demand I make, but should I fail to make such
demand would it not be my condemnation? No matter
what the result to the present order of things,
should I hold my peace I could not face myself.</p>

<p>The bible speaks of the redemption of the body
and Christians have taught the resurrection of the
same body that we put off; but they are learning better
than that, and the bodies of their dead will soon
be sent to the crematory instead of to the cemetery
to wait the call of Gabriel's trump; and yet the idea
is not so far wrong as to fact, as to the how.</p>

<p>We are now continually changing the matter of
which our bodies are composed, throwing off and taking
on, but suppose that while thus throwing off
we utterly lost the power to take on? Why that
would be death, you say. Yes, the death of the
body, but the soul, the inner garment of the self-hood
still exists as a connecting link with matter. Now
suppose that this self-hood should discover a law by
which there could be drawn to this astral body which
is here called soul, enough of matter to form a new
body, would not that be resurrection?</p>

<p>That is what spirits are experimenting upon in
what is called materialization.</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>The first body is started on its way through the
mingling of male and female secretions from matter
and is called generation. But we have the term, regeneration
as connected with human destiny; what
does that mean? Regenerate; to generate over.
Can any kind of generation take place without the
mingling of the two elements or forces? Materialization
is the beginning of the resurrection of the bodies
of the so-called dead, and that which we are told
is needed to perfect the work is sufficient spiritualized
sex aura to act as a condenser upon matter.
Such aura can be eliminated only in love relations.</p>

<p>Said I not that the resurrection of the dead as
well as the redemption of the living depended upon
the freedom of woman? There will then be none but
love relations.</p>

<p>I have surely given good and sufficient reasons
for demanding the full freedom of woman, with all
it implies. The next question is, how to reach it.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch03">

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">FIRST STEPS&mdash;METHODS.</p>

</div>

<p>The declaration of the full meaning of the "Woman
Movement" will startle many who call themselves
reformers, but there are a few who will measure
the demand here made, not from what it will cost
but from what, actualized, it will be worth to the
race. Such will judge of it, not from a standard of
morality which has been formulated to sustain a system
of authority, but from the standpoint of reason,
science, and common sense, and they will ask by what
means it is proposed to make so great a change, what
are the first steps toward it?</p>

<p>Right thinking is the first step toward right acting.
If it be true that 'as a man thinketh so is he' it
is equally true of woman, and she must learn, if she
would fully respect herself, to realize the dignity of
sex independent of statutes. This is necessary to a
proper estimate of her place and power even under
the marriage bond; for, if sex is something low,
something the use of which naturally degrades, then
marriage is reduced to the level of a licensed indulgence,
a something which is permitted if consent is
asked, paid for, and the public informed of the fact.</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>I shall never forget hearing an old man say when
I was a mere child that women and geese were necessary
evils. When it is remembered that in those days
a "tick" containing from ten to twenty pounds of
feathers was considered a necessity for every bed and
that geese were the farmer's annoyance, that he endured
them because he thought he must the significance
of that remark becomes apparent. It was practically
saying:</p>

<p>"Woman is a weak, sniveling creature, she is
always making a fuss about something, and children
make no end of trouble, but her sex is necessary to
my gratification, so I, poor man, endure the evil."</p>

<p>Yes, and his wife, a little delicate creature who
died nearly twenty years before he did, endured giving
birth to six sons and five daughters in connection
with the hardships of a pioneer life. I do not mean
to say that in those days all men felt as that man
did, but there was enough of this feeling to give a
heavy tint to the prevailing thought that sex was a
low thing anyhow, but considering man's needs, if a
woman was owned legally its use was allowable.</p>

<p>But in this legal arrangement woman has not
been considered so far as her pleasure is concerned,
and her education has been such that she is not willing
to own to sex desire lest she should be despised,
and if she yields herself outside the marriage bond
then, no matter what the circumstances, she is looked
upon as ruined. Out upon such nonsense! When, in
the book bearing her name and the register of her
vow, Helen Harlow declares that no woman is ruined
unless she thinks so, she struck the key note of woman's

<!-- page 32 -->

freedom. Men have learned that they can do
without feather beds, and they must learn to do without
sexual slaves.</p>

<p>In the mutual relations of free men with free women,
where all the movements of society have been
adjusted to such freedom, while the need for companionship
will remain, the 'evil' will disappear. Having
changed our thought of sex, having lifted it out of the
ditch of obscenity and contempt and made it what it
really should be, the crown of life, it is no longer
abused, therefore the associative results are good and
good only, be they physical, mental, or spiritual.</p>

<p>Our first effort then, must be in thought sphere.
We must learn to judge of things from their nature
and power and not from the standpoint of human enactments.
We must change the mental atmosphere.
On pages 85-6 of "The Occult Forces of Sex," speaking
of the physical atmosphere we find the following:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>But there is an atmosphere that sustains the same relation
to the mental and spiritual as does this of which we
have been speaking to the physical. Whence comes this
mental, this spiritual atmosphere? From whence does it
obtain its life or death-dealing power? From the sex life
acting through the brain organs. Those organs of the brain
brought into action when the sex act is thought of or consummated,
give character to this atmosphere, make it moral
or immoral, degrading or elevating in its tendency.</p>

<p>If we think of this act as something low, enter into it
under conditions that our self-respect disapproves, then we
give off a degrading sex atmosphere, for the low thought,
acting through the brain poisons it. The lungs of the soul,
of the spirit body breathe this atmosphere, giving a healthy
or diseased action, even as the lungs of the physical body
take in the material atmosphere, giving health or disease
physically.</p>

</div>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>Can anything show more clearly the degrading
tendency of the sex act under any and all conditions
but those of mutual love and respect. Though the
above was penned more than twenty years since, the
depth and breadth of meaning still grows upon me.
In the previous chapter the law of vibrations was
touched upon and the fact stated that a method had
been discovered through which the form of the vibrations
of the human voice upon the atmosphere could
be taken, said forms being flowers, serpents, etc., as
was the character of the feeling behind the voice.</p>

<p>But the feeling, if the prevailing one, does not
always need to be spoken; it has given its character
to the mental atmosphere. Now consider the prevailing
thought in reference to sex, remembering at the
same time that because of it we live, then wonder, if
you can, that vice and crime prevail. Despising the
source of life, how can there be that genuine respect
for ourselves or others which tends to moral strength?</p>

<p>Think how even in the marriage bed woman's
sex has been enslaved and abused, and imagine if you
can the atmospheric vibrations&mdash;imagine the pictures
when the husband (?) says: "What do you suppose I
married you for," and the wife yields with every feeling
of her soul repulsed and with a sense of degradation
that nearly crushes the life out of her&mdash;imagine
the thought vibrations, the feelings taking form in the
shape of loathsome creatures corresponding thereto,
such feelings to be embodied in the next generation.</p>

<p>How long will it take to save the world while such
conditions exist, and exist they will so long as woman
is sexually enslaved.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>But oh, this mighty thought power! what ruin
it can produce and what strength it can give! Think
of the young girl who loves to consummation without
legal sanction&mdash;imagine the thought directed toward
her, surrounding her, enveloping her with a cloud of
images that are worse than the locusts of Egypt.</p>

<p>Under such a pressure the poor girl is very likely
to sink, but she is not ruined by what she has done
but by what a falsely educated public thinks of her
and forces her to think of herself. Suppose she could
be positive to this outside sphere of thought, could
rise above it and say with Helen Harlow, no woman
is ruined unless she thinks so, would she be ruined
then? No, she would be grand.</p>

<p>Let us imagine such one; let us think of a woman
strong in the divinity of her self-hood&mdash;one who
sees clearly her right to herself and deliberately lives
that right in spite of man or devils, think of such a
woman moving on with head erect, and a strength of
soul that, refusing to be crushed, drives the swarming
thought images of vileness back with her own
positive self-respect, thus forcing respect from others,
and you have imagined one greater than any Jesus
on the cross, or Daniel in the den of Lions, for the
lions flee and the cross disappears as she prepares the
way for the fullness of a salvation that neither man,
nor God-Man can bring.</p>

<p>In the picture drawn of what is&mdash;must be under
given conditions so long as present methods and ideas
of thinking prevail, the needed first steps toward
woman's full freedom are plainly indicated. We
must change this mental atmosphere, must clear it of

<!-- page 35 -->

its poison, of its serpent vibrations by thinking right
thoughts, pure thoughts, reverential thoughts of sex,
must clear it from the malarial idea of the need of
woman's being owned in its use, of the idea of degradation
if not thus owned.</p>

<p>The married woman is legally in the same position,
with the exception of the right of sale, that the negro
was before the abolition of chattel slavery, owned,
and in the use of her sex, disgraced if she is not
owned. The "free nigger" was an abomination in
the south. The negroes themselves regarded them
as such, or pretended to so regard them if they really
did not, in order to win favor with their masters.</p>

<p>Married women now take the same position in regard
to the woman who claims the right to her own
person. And yet women are thinking, thinking. I
read a few pages of what I am now writing, pages
containing my full demand for woman, to a friend
who called upon me not long since, and when I paused
she remarked:</p>

<p>"That is just what I have claimed for years; I have
talked it to hundreds of women." This lady has a
grown daughter, a sweet girl who is no stranger to
her mother's ideas. "In danger of being ruined?"
Not a bit of danger. She can never be seduced. She
understands herself and if she acts at all, will do so intelligently&mdash;with
a purpose.</p>

<p>When I talk with women on this subject the responses
that I get make me think of the early dawning
of the springtime when vegetation is not yet
in sight but is all ready to burst through the surface
into the sunlight. There are thousands of self-respecting

<!-- page 36 -->

women who, feeling and knowing their need of
love and their right to themselves, are living independent
lives so far as fact is concerned, though not
yet ready to declare that life to the public, for as yet,
it would be like opening a sheep fold when the wolves
held possession of the surroundings.</p>

<p>There are also thousands of men who respect such
women as much as a wife can be respected. The seed
is already sown for woman's ultimate freedom and
the harvest is sure to come.</p>

<p>But even in all the past nature has been too strong
for theory, making those who oppose woman's freedom
testify against themselves. Why is woman held
to so much more bitter condemnation than are men
for the same act if the deciding vote does not rightfully
belong to her?</p>

<p>In all else the greatest blame for disastrous consequences,
or for the violation of rules, rests upon
those to whom are intrusted the greatest responsibility,
but how can such responsibility rest upon one who
has not the right to herself. How can such responsibility
be required of one who may use her natural
functions only under the sanction of man-made statute
first and then must be subject to the legal owner of
this department of herself ever after?</p>

<p>Restore to woman her right to herself, protect
her in that right and then she can justly be held responsible
for such abuse of that right as tends to curse
present or future generations. Till this is done the
holding of her to such responsibility is acknowledging
her right while refusing to grant it.</p>

<p>Yes, just such freedom, the full ownership of

<!-- page 37 -->

her own person is woman's natural inherent right, and
with my head whitening for the tomb, with the surety
that my time is short, I fearlessly assert that only in
such freedom is there such elevation for the race as
we all desire and believe to be possible. I declare
this in the full belief that it is the greatest service I
can render the coming generations.</p>

<p>To those who object I would say, can such freedom
for woman give us worse results than we now
have? Please remember that I make this one claim
paramount&mdash;assert that all else must conform to this&mdash;that
our economic system must be so changed as to
make it possible for all women to secure financial
support independent of that subjection to the individual
man which is now legalized prostitution.</p>

<p>If a woman must pledge herself for a day or an
hour longer than she wishes to any man it is no more
or less than prostitution, and then to be held to an
unwilling relation in order to be with her children or
for a support is adding slavery thereto.</p>

<p>Can women thus held become the mothers of a
race of men and women who, self-centered, self-sustained
in all high and noble endeavor, shall be able to
make this earth what it is capable of becoming, a veritable
paradise? Certainly not. Therefore, recognizing
the magnitude of the powers that oppose, I unhesitatingly
make the full demand as the first step toward
its fulfillment, and declare that if an act is pure it is
so independent of any outside sanction&mdash;that if impure,
in and of itself, no outside sanction can make
it otherwise.</p>

<p>No outside sanction can change the character of

<!-- page 38 -->

an act either for good or for evil only so far as our
ideas have been perverted by being made to believe
that such sanction is needed. But in that case it is
what we believe and not what we do that produces
the results we deplore. Here comes in the power of
thought, of belief for good or evil, and one of the
most convincing proofs of the power of thought crystalized
into institutions is found in the fact that the
most of people will acknowledge that love is the basis
of marriage&mdash;that without it there can be no true
marriage, and yet the woman of whom everybody
says: "She married the man for his money; she has
no love for him"&mdash;such a woman, one who openly sells
herself in accordance with law, is accepted while the
poor girl who loved to its consummation without legal
sanction is forsaken by the one she loves and cast
out by society.</p>

<p>Now why is this? Society has been built upon
the idea of authority&mdash;the idea that the ruling power
has the right to command us arbitrarily, upon the
idea that the powers that be are ordained of God&mdash;upon
the law of authority instead of the law of love,
consequently the crystallized idea rules; it is too
strong for our sense of justice. This will, must continue
till the law of love becomes strong enough to
break in pieces the institutions formed on the basis
of the old.</p>

<p>The love which can do this exists in the mother
heart, and in the agitation of thought which is taking
the place of the fear of the Lord she will gain the
light to see how present institutions destroy her children,
and then the kindling power of her love will

<!-- page 39 -->

burn as an oven. It is said that "prayer is the motion
of a hidden fire, concealed within the breast."
Fire in "motion" is a powerful force. It was fire in
motion that, bursting through the rock-ribbed earth
of the past, tore the continents from their places, cast
up the mountain ranges, and mingling with the waters
of the ocean converted the waves into steam till
the sun itself was darkened.</p>

<p>They say that love is God. Think you that the
mother love concealed in woman's breast, when it is
once aroused is going to leave one stone upon another
of the institutions that crush her children. Do you
think there will be one fetter left upon her limbs
when she straightens herself. You may imprison
her, you may blind her material eyes, but you cannot
touch the eyes of her soul and she will make such
sport for you as Sampson made for the sport-loving
Philistines; she will pull the temple down upon you.</p>

<p>"Rachel" will stop "weeping for her children"
when she once realizes that she has the power to redeem
them. But she must be free ere she can do
this. Her natural love of purity coupled with the false
standard of purity in which she has been educated is
the greatest obstacle in the way, but she is learning;
when her lesson is learned she can no longer be held.</p>

<p>I repeat, however, that the first lesson to be
learned, and acted from, is that neither legal enactments
nor church sanction can make an act either
right or wrong&mdash;must learn and act from the fact that
unwelcome relations, no matter how sanctioned, are a
curse to all concerned&mdash;must learn that she has a
right to be protected from what she does not desire

<!-- page 40 -->

and to be protected in that which she does desire.</p>

<p>The fact that the right or wrong of sex relations
cannot be decided by statute is abundantly shown in
that portion of the race for whom prisons and asylums
are built. The blind, the insane, the idiotic&mdash;all imperfect
specimens of humanity give the lie to the idea
that sex-relations can be regulated by law, show that
no amount of legality can prevent or cover up the
consequences of the violations of nature's law, that
law which gives to woman the right to her own person
and demands that all else shall be made conformable
to that right, and the more thoroughly woman
understands this natural right, the more firmly she
will take the first step toward actualizing it.</p>

<p>Those who have read "The Fountain of Life"
will say I have gone back on my ideal, that of the
dual relation. Not in the least, but no ideal can be
enforced by law. It must be reached by growth, and
to those who believe that were woman entirely free
there would be more mixed sex relations than now, I
will say that to me, as I see the governing law, it is
the only path by which the dual ideal can be reached
naturally, that is by growth, and when thus reached
it will be lived without the aid of statutes.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">A WORD TO LIBERALS.</p>

</div>

<p>In deference to the people known by the above
name, a large proportion of whom do not believe that
we as individuals continue to live after the dissolution
of the body, I here devote a limited space to some
thoughts to which I respectfully ask their careful
consideration.</p>

<p>Some of them accept much that I write as very
practical, or that it would be did I not connect it
with another state of existence than this. They ask:
"Why do you bring in Spiritualism and other superstitions;
why not stick to the known laws of heredity,
stirpiculture, etc., and leave all visionary ideas out
of the question? One world at a time is enough."</p>

<p>Very true; one world at a time is enough, but I
want the whole of that world recognized. Otherwise,
as I see things, causes will remain untouched,
and it is useless to deal with effects only. What we
see, hear and touch with the physical&mdash;no, with the
spiritual senses acting through the physical, are but
the effects of causes that must be sought in the realm
of that which we call the ideal.</p>

<p>If any one can show me a single thing that is now
accepted as practical which did not first exist in the

<!-- page 42 -->

ideal&mdash;exist as a theory, then I will concede that in
trying to show the invisible but potent causes of things
I am leaving the practical sphere.</p>

<p>Yes, the idea of but one world at a time is all
right, but I perceive that there is very much more to
this one world than has generally been supposed, and
that we recognize much to-day that was entirely unknown
a hundred years ago, and I believe the time is
near when that state of existence which is correlated
to soul and intellect but not visibly to the body, will
be recognized to be as much a part of this world as
are soul and intellect to be constituent elements of a
human being.</p>

<p>Could our Liberal friends once perceive the law
which makes continued existence not only possible
but a necessity, they would know that in dropping the
body we do not leave this world, and they would use
that knowledge very effectively against the superstitious
reverence for that state of existence which now
so curses the race. The spirit world, what is it?</p>

<p>As before said, it is simply that state of existence
correlated to soul and intellect; we are now in the
spirit world as the blind are in the midst of light, or
deaf the midst of sound. Who are they who dwell in
that world? According to bible teaching they are
those who wait for the redemption of their bodies;
why then should we reverence those who have lost
and are waiting to regain what we still retain? They,
having been born into matter as we know it here,
but being ignorant of its laws, could not so control
and refine it as to hold their bodies at will. Instead
of unfolding the spirit in harmony with the laws of

<!-- page 43 -->

the body they did so at its expense, consequently the
body was left behind in what is called dying.</p>

<p>In still other words, the law of life that can regenerate,
continually make over the body to meet the
wants of the indwelling spirit has not been lived,
therefore, upon woman has fallen the pangs of continuing
to generate bodies for the multitudes who
throng the gate of birth.</p>

<p>Those invisible men and women sustain a somewhat
similar relation to the physical word that the
ideal in the brain of the inventor does to the model
he has built from it. The model, which is the body
of the idea, may be destroyed but the idea itself still
lives and seeks a new embodiment. The idea is unseen
only as patterned, only as embodied in matter,
but it is nevertheless, indestructible; it is imaged
forever upon the vibratory esse of the universe.</p>

<p>So of men and women, even when here in the
body; they are forever unseen. We only see the
models and very imperfect ones at that; and when the
model or body can no longer in any sense represent
them, then the real man and woman, the real individual
has no way to manifest in this state of existence
only as there is again such contact with matter as will
give, at least a temporary control of it. That this
has been done at times through all the ages of the
past the records of all peoples testify, but ignorance
of natural law and the false teaching resulting from
such ignorance have rendered such manifestations a
curse to the human family, vast religious organizations
having been reared thereon which to-day hold
the world in subjection.</p>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p>Our mental scientists sometimes succeed quite
well in "denying" away disease, pain, etc., but I
opine it would be better to seek for and remove the
causes, for then the force put forth to rise above the
condition would no longer be needed in that direction.</p>

<p>So our materialistic friends, having felt the evils
of a superstitious reverence for those unseen but still
living intelligences, may be somewhat successful so
far as they, themselves, are concerned, in denying it
all away, declaring there is no such thing, no cause
for the effects manifested.</p>

<p>Would it not be better to scientifically explore
this unseen state of existence; to let in the light of
reason and common sense upon it, to make ourselves
so familiar with it that we shall no more think of deferring
to, or taking orders from its inhabitants than
we do of worshiping or obeying the people of England,
France or Russia.</p>

<p>The belief in such a state of existence must have
some sort of a foundation. The idea that all the great
systems of religion which rule the world are bottomed
on nothing is too much like that other idea that God
made the world out of nothing, for an intelligent
agnostic to accept if once the mind is divested of prejudice,
or so it seems to me.</p>

<p>The reader will find on page 10 of "The Fountain
of Life, or The Threefold Power of Sex," the
following proposition which is there put forth as an
axiom:</p>

<p>"We cannot conceive of that which does not exist.
We may narrow the conception, twist it out of shape, pervert
it because of our ignorance, but still it is, it must be
rooted in truth."</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>Believing said proposition to be irrefutable I
must believe in continued existence, even if I had no
other evidence. It is because the conception of that
state of existence has been so perverted, so twisted out
of shape that so much superstition has arisen, and if
our Agnostic and Materialistic, or so-called Infidel
friends would cease to ignore&mdash;to deny, and looking
the question squarely in the face, help to take the
twist out of it, they could do so much better than
even Spiritualists themselves, because, being more
free from hereditary superstition, they could judge
more impartially.</p>

<p>In evidence of that continued existence it is a
well established fact that photographs of our so-called
departed friends have been taken; and yet it has been
said that a photograph of that which could not be
seen or which did not cast a shadow, could not be
obtained but what are the facts? The idea was founded
upon a misconception of the law involved, for we
have since learned that a likeness, not only of what
the eye can not see, but the telescope can not reach,
can be caught by the photographer's art.</p>

<p>Distant stars have thus been reached, and by
what law? By the law of chemical attraction.</p>

<p>The diffused rays of light coming from such stars
were too scattered for the power of the telescope, but
by analyzing their nature, chemicals have been combined
and used in photography by the attracting
power of which these scattered rays have been drawn
together, focused, and lo, the astronomer catalogues
another star.</p>

<p>It has been found that only a third part of a ray

<!-- page 46 -->

of light, to-wit, its chemical portion. is used in photography.
It is this which acts upon the chemically
prepared plate to produce the image, consequently,
the objection to spirit pictures because there is nothing
to be seen, or that casts a shadow, falls to the
ground. If they who have left the mortal body have
power enough to make themselves so positive to matter
as to throw back a third part of a ray of light
upon the lens of the camera and their likeness can
be taken by the same law that ours is; indeed if
taken at all it must be by the same law for there are
no miracles.</p>

<p>The world does not question the scientist when
he tells us the number of vibrations to the inch of a
ray of red light, of blue, purple, and so on through
all the primary colors, and yet the majority of people
would be as much at a loss to explain how the scientist
was able to measure those vibrations as is the Agnostic
to understand the law of spirit communication.</p>

<p>The priesthood of all the great religions of the
world have understood in a measure the law of the
finer forces of nature, and have known how to use
them to their own advantage and to the enslavement
of mankind, and passing into the unseen life they have
continued to use that power through those in this life
who harmonize with, or are subject to them; in the
latter case holding them by the same law that hypnotists
do their subjects.</p>

<p>But this knowledge has been withheld from the
"common people" and why? "Oh, because they will.
make bad use of it." Turning to "The Occult Forces
of Sex," I find on page 97 the following from Professor

<!-- page 47 -->

Elliot Coues, a student of Oriental literature.</p>

<p class="small">"I have long and steadily spoken, in the face of much
ridicule, of the inherent dangers, not the less real because
little suspected and scarcely credited, which attend the
practice of magnetism; and of the disastrous consequences
likely to ensue should the knowledge of such arts become
public property. I have conscientiously striven to keep
such things secret as they should be, or at least confined to
those students of psychic science who can be trusted to
discreetly use such knowledge. But it is already painfully
evident that the secret is an open one, of which any sufficiently
courageous knave may avail himself."</p>

<p>Did the gentleman live in India, and were he a
member of the Brahmin caste, he would have no difficulty
in keeping such knowledge from those they
class as the <i>vulgar herd</i>, but are there no "courageous
knaves" among the higher classes? Have the initiated
always used their knowledge discreetly? Let the condition
of the masses in all lands answer. Any knowledge
that any courageous knave, if he can gain access
thereto, can use to the injury of others, should be
made public property so that all may protect themselves from
its improper use.</p>

<p>But, admitting the fact of continued life, there is
another point to be considered. The ruling classes,
taking with them the knowledge obtained here, have
become the hierarchies of that life. This in strict accord
with the known laws of mind, and I want to ask
my Liberal friends right here, if such spirit hierarchies,
seeing the observing nature of the average Free-thinker,
would not much rather you would disbelieve
in continued life than that you should accept and
persistently investigate? Are you not possibly playing

<!-- page 48 -->

into the hands of those who hold the masses in
superstitious awe?</p>

<p>But, be that as it may, we can see here, all about
us the effect of keeping the people in ignorance lest
they misuse knowledge, of keeping people enslaved
lest they should misuse their freedom; and in no one
thing is it more sadly exemplified than in this one
question of sex. We have an arbitrary code of sex
morality, and ignorant or wise, intensely organized
or like an icicle, that code must be lived or social
damnation is the result. To show the results of such
damnation we give the following as taken from an
eastern paper, the same in substance being published
of several others:</p>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, Oct. 16.&mdash;At the session last evening of
the National Social Purity Congress, Mrs. Charlton Edholm,
of Chicago, said:</p>

<p>"Of the 230,000 erring girls in the country, over half
have been snared or sold into their lives of shame. The
average life is five years. Forty-six thousand are carted
to the Potter's field every year. Over one hundred American
homes have to be desolated every day to recruit the
ranks of shame.</p>

<p>"Isn't it time that somebody is trying to save these
girls from falling into those dens of iniquity? Twenty
million Christians can rescue 230,000 erring girls, or surely
the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ is a failure."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Edholm read a long list of statistics bearing
upon her subject, and added:</p>

<p>"Men go out into the country districts and bring these
girls into our cities. A mock marriage is often performed
and the girl is taken into these haunts of shame believing
she is going to a boarding house. One man who was recently
converted, told me he had gone through the marriage
ceremony twenty times, and every time sold the girl
into a house of ill repute."</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>Mrs. Edholm headed a party of fifteen women and men
to visit the houses on Josephine street last night, after the
purity meeting was over. A policeman and a number of
newspaper men accompanied the party. From the purity
meeting they went to the City Hall and from there to the
Western police station. It was near midnight when Josephine
street was reached.</p>

<p>The "slumming party" divided itself into two sections,
one for each side of the thoroughfare, and entered each
house as they went along. The policemen in most cases led
the way into the parlors, which the members of the expedition
took possession of, singing and praying with such of
the inmates as did not seek refuge in other rooms. In many
instances they were laughed at, and in one case a girl said:</p>

<p>"I know you mean well coming here, but you don't
know how little good it will do. Instead of coming here,
you had better go around to some of those factories and
shops that grind a poor girl down to $2 a week, and get
them to pay better wages. It's no use; a girl can't live on
what she gets. You had better put in your efforts there."</p>

<p>In another, the proprietress, who was plainly intoxicated,
exclaimed: "We don't want none of you in here. My
girls don't want to talk with you. We don't want you Protestants
to come around and bother us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Edholm pleaded with her but it was of no use.
Apparently no impression was made. As the party left
some unsavory language came floating down the stairway.
"Here, girls! here, girls! no cursing!" the woman called out.</p>

<p>In the third Mrs. Edholm urged one of the inmates to
leave the place.</p>

<p>"I would like to," she said, "but I cannot. I have two
children that I have to support and pay for their schooling.
One is eleven years old and the other thirteen. They are
not in this city. My children are the purest, sweetest things
on earth. I would not have them know about me for the
world. I want to leave this life but I can't. You don't
know how it is."</p>

</div>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>The&mdash;well, I was going to say, infinite nonsense
of all that frantic effort to hold the world to an arbitrary
morality strikes me so forcibly that but for its
pitiable pathos I could laugh. Our Liberals have
long known that the religion of "The Lord Jesus
Christ" is a failure, that no 20,000,000 or twenty
times that number can save those girls, that to eradicate
the social evil under an arbitrary system of
morality connected with an economic system which
<i>inevitably</i> makes the rich richer and the poor poorer,
is simply an impossibility.</p>

<p>If a chicken is once tamed, no matter how much
it is beaten it will never get wild again, will never
have sense enough to be afraid of you. When I read
about that "slumming party," and remembered how
many times prayer has been tried I could but think of
the tamed chicken. When once educational piety
strikes in, no matter how many disappointments, the
praying ones never get any sense into their heads.
They'll keep praying to their Jesus, no matter what
the result. The girls themselves showed more sense.</p>

<p>How many of those women would have taken
one of those girls to their own homes and given them
a chance to live&mdash;to regain the self-respect of which
they have been robbed? Was there in all that "Purity
Congress" self-denial enough to prompt those women
to spend a little less upon themselves that they
might be able to take that mother out of that place
and give her the means of an honorable support with
her children?</p>

<p>Oh, that mother! There is the love that can
save the world if it can be made to think so, if it can

<!-- page 51 -->

be freed. Oh, crucified life-love! nailed to the cross,
spit upon, drinking the wormwood pressed to the lips
till death closes the scene, when wilt thou be understood
and thy power appreciated!</p>

<p>I should like to have heard the demand for woman's
freedom that I here make read before that Social
Purity Congress; I should like to have listened to
the remarks, to the expressions of horror from those
followers of Jesus Christ, and then I would have
asked Mrs. Edholm and the others if they believed,
with such freedom, such adjustment of societary conditions
coupled with an intelligent understanding of
sex, as that demand calls for, that even one of those
46,000 girls would be annually carted to the Potter's
field? I do not.</p>

<p>What then is the natural inference? Why, that
rather than give up their enforced, or attempted enforcement
of a legal morality they will sacrifice annually
46,000 girls upon the altar of their false standard&mdash;upon
the altar of their subservience to the rulership
idea of "The Lord Jesus Christ." Will they
never learn the futility of trying to dam up the river
of life! Will they never learn to sit at the feet of
mother nature and learn of her laws instead of trying
to impede her work by consenting to the enslaving
of her highest representative, Woman!</p>

<p>But right here some Liberal asks: Why do
you take so much pains to call our attention to these
sad facts? You will find but few, if any of our girls
among the inmates of houses of ill-fame. The
emotional efforts of religious revivals are but the
primary steps to prostitution and we work to bring

<!-- page 52 -->

discredit on all such hot house efforts, and the superstitions
connected with them; what more can we do?"</p>

<p>What can you do? Right thinking comes before
right acting. You must learn that there is something
more to be done than to ignore or ridicule
church claims if you would put down church tyranny.
You must learn the real source of their power, and
that it extends into the, to us, invisible world. When
you have cast aside your prejudice, have become willing
to weigh human testimony in reference to an almost
universal experience&mdash;an experience extending
back through history till lost in the past, when you
have done all this, then you will make practical progress
toward wiping out the curse of superstition.</p>

<p>Just so long as you sustain every institution of
society but the church you are still its supporters.
Back door supporters you can be called, but still you
are upholding its power.</p>

<p>So long as the church controls sex she controls
everything.</p>

<p>So long as you uphold the property system as it
is; so long as you consent that woman's sex shall be
the property of the husband, so long as you count
honest statements connected with sex, whether in the
bible or elsewhere, obscene, so long you are helping
to perpetuate church power. For, as I have asserted
and shall show in the next chapter, that sex is the
basis of the power by which the church rules, and
there is nothing she so much dreads as honest investigation
of sex law independent of any arbitrary
standard of morality.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 53 -->

<div class="center" id="ch05">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE REASONS WHY.</p>

</div>

<p>The church, in the name of "The Lord Jesus
Christ" lays claim to universal dominion. It does
this openly, boldly and as something to glory in.
That it should oppose that which tends to hinder or
destroy its power is entirely natural; but, in taking
steps to prevent that which is detrimental to itself it
always puts forth a false claim, always seeks to impress
upon the mind of the public that it is acting for
the public good. And a large portion of the rank
and file of its adherents believe this to be true.</p>

<p>In analyzing some of the things which have been
and are being done, or are persistently worked for by
church adherents, the object of this chapter is to see
if we can find the true reason therefor. We know
the claim, but we want to get behind the scenes and
find the truth. The declared purpose of what is
called the Comstock law, was that of preventing the
scattering of obscene literature among the young.
If said law could really be used to accomplish this
and was directed toward that evil only, we might believe
the object to be as stated, but when we find
honest investigators of sex-law, those whose purpose
is to purify society by giving it correct knowledge

<!-- page 54 -->

upon this all-important subject&mdash;when we find such
earnest workers arrested and imprisoned under said
law, we have cause to believe that the true reason for
its enactment has not been given.</p>

<p>In order to find why the church opposes the open
and honest investigation of sex we must notice first
the fact that the church secures its adherents by appealing
to the emotions instead of the reasoning
faculties, and next we must find what relation sex life,
sex desire sustains to the emotional nature, and when
this is done we may be able to understand the real
reason for the law which makes it dangerous to investigate
sex independently of church theory.</p>

<p>That religion deals with the emotional nature is
too evident to need proof, but the relation of sex to
the emotions is not quite so clear; and yet a legislator,
writing upon what is called "The age of consent'
law, really strikes the key note. I find the following
in the July Arena for 1895. A. C. Thompson says:</p>

<p class="small">"In these days of enlightenment and civilization, religious
instruction and moral training enter largely into the
lives of children, thereby giving an early knowledge of
good and evil; hence it not infrequently happens that when
the first dawnings of sexual appetite make their appearance
his natural desire, is under proper instruction, changed in
character and becomes an acquired psychical habitude&mdash;religious
emotion. For it is a fact and one capable of easy
demonstration that there is a close relation between religious
emotion and sexual desire&mdash;the natural desire and
the acquired emotion taking the places of one another, on
occasions unconsciously and without volitional effort on the
part of those in whom the transformation takes place."</p>

<p>On the next page the same writer says:</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<div class="small">

<p>"When vita sexualis is established at or near puberty,
this moral training will bear fruit, and the young girl,
yearning for she knows not what, will in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred, find perfect satisfaction in religious
emotion."</p>

<p>For further evidence upon this point I take the following
from pages 96-97 of the Occult Forces of Sex:</p>

<p>Professor Elliot Coues, a student of Oriental literature
and philosophy, says that it is largely concerned in what in
the West is called mesmerism, and in the East magic. Now,
it is well known that the Oriental nations are wholly under
the control of the priesthood. Is it the knowledge of
mesmerism, or magic, which gives the priest this power? But
what is mesmerism? Listen to this Oriental scholar:</p>

<p>"The mesmeric force is simply sex magnetism."</p>

<p>Ah, then magicians use sex-magnetism. The wonderful
powers of the Eastern fakirs, or mediums, come from the
fact that their controlling spirits know how to gather and use
sex-magnetism. But he also calls it psychic force. Psychic
pertains to soul.</p>

<p>Sex-magnetism, soul-force, the power by means of
which one person holds control over another, or the few
over the many. No wonder the religions of the world have
sought to control sex. No wonder that the church of to-day
fights the opening up of the sex question&mdash;the study of
sex-law.</p>

</div>

<p>This as taken from the product of the Professor's
pen, together with comments on the same, was published
some six years since, and now here comes our
Kentucky legislator with testimony right in line.
"Mesmeric force is simply sex magnetism." "Psychic
force," "The secret of Spiritual mediumship."
The sexual appetite changed in character, "becomes
an acquired physical habitude&mdash;religious emotion."</p>

<p>What do all these mean if sex is not the basis of

<!-- page 56 -->

religion, or rather, the connecting link between this
and another life, and a too close analysis of the foundation
would tend to topple over the superstructure.</p>

<p>What does it mean but that it is through a knowledge
of sex law that the priesthood here and their coadjutors
in the unseen state of existence rule the people.
Self-preservation is the first law of nature, then
why should not the church seek through legal enactments
to prevent the spread of sex knowledge.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a good and sufficient reason for
the effort that secured the Comstock law. Again, it
is a fact that no thinker will dispute that wherever
there is action there is waste of some kind, that there
is a something set free which corresponds to the nature
of the action or emotion. It follows then, when
sex desire is transformed into religious emotion that
in the action upon the desire which transforms it,
there is set free a fine element, a sex-aura, what becomes
of it? Is it not appropriated by those who
so stir emotion that it absorbs the desire?</p>

<p>Professor Coues says that mesmeric force is simply
sex magnetism, but sex magnetism is life force
and the question that needs to be solved is, does the
magnetizer or hypnotist use his sex force as a vital,
controlling power, or does he use it to attract that element
from his subjects, thus controlling them by
what is taken from them?</p>

<p>I have noticed that healers and hypnotists are
gatherers and that all successful ministers are hypnotists;
not consciously perhaps, but that does not
change the fact. That some people possess remarkable
power is not to be disputed, but, I think that a

<!-- page 57 -->

little investigation would show them to be natural
magnets. I have long been aware that I must protect
myself from healers if their healing power was
directed toward another instead of myself, for if I became
in any way interested I would soon find myself
exhausted, would feel that strength, "virtue" had
gone from me.</p>

<p>But my attention was more particularly drawn to
this question by an experience of an aged lady who
had been for many years a physician. There came to
an adjoining town a man who could so hypnotize a subject
that he would extract his own teeth if they needed
extracting, and without pain. He would call a
crowd around him and do this in any public place. In
telling me her experience the lady said:</p>

<p class="small">We had business over at S. while the man was there
and when we were through we drove around to where he
was and sat and watched his way of doing. Presently, and
for the first time in my life, I fainted. In my interest in
what he was doing I forgot myself and became so negative
my strength was all drawn from me. I then understood
how it was done; he drew force from the crowd and concentrated
it upon the one he wished to affect.</p>

<p>Since listening to that lady's explanation I have
observed more closely, and I am fully satisfied that
hypnotists do not, as a rule, use their own vital force
but control their subjects by drawing theirs to themselves.
Take this thought and compare it with the
power held by the priesthood over the people and
what is the conclusion? Remember, please, that students
of this question declare mesmeric force to be
sex magnetism, psychic force, etc.</p>

<p>It is a demonstrated fact that the finer forces are

<!-- page 58 -->

the most powerful, if then, "sex desire is transformed
into religious emotion" does it all become emotion?
No, there is, there must be a fine force, an aura set
free, and what becomes of it if not appropriated by
those who thus stir the emotions religiously? It is
not hard then, to see where the church gets her power,
and that so long as she rules sex she rules everything.
Once get an idea what an understanding of
the principles of sex would be to the human family,
how it would free them from all church dominance,
and you will see why honest investigators of sex law
are persecuted. It is a matter of self-preservation.</p>

<p class="small">The young girl yearning for she knows not what, will
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, find perfect satisfaction
in religious emotion.</p>

<p>What a thought is here! Exhaling the sex life
through intense emotion as water is changed to steam
by intense heat. But the water thus exhaled is not
lost; no more is the sex life. Some years since I met
a medium who said she had something to tell some
one that spirits had told her about sex&mdash;told me they
said they knew what to do with the viril&mdash;viril, the
life of sex, yes, that is just what I am trying to show;
they do know what to do, both with the aura of that
which is mutually exhaled, (if not directed by the
parties themselves) that which is exhaled in religious
emotion, and that which is simply thrown away so far
as the parties are concerned, because of a lack of mutual
feeling. All this forms a reservoir of power, and
it is now being used to build up and perpetuate this
present order of things, this system of cannibalism in
which the many are sacrificed to the few.</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p>Some years since I listened to a powerful discourse
from the lips of an entranced medium which
purported to come from Thomas Paine. Had I not
known that the laws of mind must be the same in all
worlds, I should have looked upon the statements
made as the vagaries of a diseased brain, but as death,
so called, could not change individual characteristics,
I felt that under such circumstances Thomas Paine
would do as stated.</p>

<p>He said that when he was somewhat rested after
entering spirit life, he heard a call from an advanced
Congress of spirits. He did not want to go,
but the call became so urgent he finally responded,
and he found they were consulting as to how they
could make a breach in the walls enclosing the great
Catholic hierarchy there, and they wanted his advice.
He so realized the importance of the undertaking that
he volunteered his services. He then described the various
steps taken, how he studied spiritual chemistry
till he could mold the elements at will, how he then
clothed himself in a robe of the Order and finally
gained an entrance; but only what follows has any
bearing on the subject under discussion.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the place was perfectly dazzling.
The radiance of the one who was at the head
of all this was such that one could not look steadily
till accustomed to it. But he won the favor of this
high official and was shown over all the territory occupied
by the priesthood, and by others of high position.
Finally, after a great deal of persistent effort,
he obtained a glimpse of the abodes of the common
people. Go, traverse the palace of the Czar of Russia,

<!-- page 60 -->

and then visit the homes of helpless poverty and
you have the idea as far as the material plane can illustrate
the condition.</p>

<p>The parallel is perfect only that is an octave
higher. And why not? Why should not such earth
conditions develop such spirit conditions? Where, do
you ask, do those spirit dignitaries get all their magnificence?
You forget that sex is creative&mdash;yes, creative,
the cruder portion on the material plane only,
but not all absorbed in building bodies. Strength is
produced, and under the direction of intelligence material
forms, all the product of sex, are molded into
beauty and use. The intelligence there is not less, and
church institutions there are controlled by the same
spirit as here; personal authority and aggrandizement.
Were this not so, why should there be need for a new
"heaven" as well as a new earth?</p>

<p>Not only is the parallel between the conditions
here and there perfect, but the methods which bring
such conditions are paralleled. Here the magnificence
which adorns the homes of the rich is drawn
from the results of the toil of the poor, and that is
why they are poor; and the honor they accord to
those in high places only rivets their chains the tighter,
for with all servile honor to another there goes a
portion of our own life force to strengthen that other.</p>

<p>That is why I object to worship; and that is why
the spiritual 'powers that be' are prompting such determined
efforts on the part of their earth adherents
to secure the observation of the Sabbath. If Sunday
worship should cease and religious emotion be no
longer manufactured it would have a similar effect upon

<!-- page 61 -->

the principalities and powers in that life that cutting
off interest, rent, etc., would have here upon
those who live from the toil of others. When the
new order of life, both here and there, is ushered in,
worship as practiced now will cease. The only helpful
worship is that of men and women for each other.</p>

<p>But all spirits do not gather sex life for their own
purposes, and this force can be changed into other
than religious emotion. A friend of mine had a young
son who contracted the habit of self-abuse. His health
began to fail but she did not suspect the cause. There
came a medium to her home and when entranced told
her what the trouble was, proposing the development
of mediumship as a remedy. The boy consented to
sit in circles and soon became a fine medium. The desire
to continue his habit disappeared, and he was
well and happy.</p>

<p>But his grandmother, who was bitterly opposed to
everything of the kind, determined to break it up, so
she set the school children to ridiculing him, pointing
their fingers at him, etc. It was more than the
boy could endure; he gave up his mediumship, fell
back into his old habit and died. The power which
controlled that lad used his sex life to unfold his soul
force, but against the interest of the church, and all
the opposition to such use of sex that church spirits
could bring to bear upon the grandmother was
used to break him down.</p>

<p>We here quote our Kentucky legislator again,
for what he says means so much.</p>

<p class="small">The young girl, yearning for she knows not what, will
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, find perfect satisfaction
in religious emotion.</p>

<!-- page 62 -->

<p>I believe this to be in a measure true, at least for
a time, but the transformed sex aura&mdash;the emotional
steam is an over-wrought condition, which is certain
to re-act, and the individual self-hood is thus weakened;
while at the same time those who have gathered
that emotionalized aura have obtained an undue
influence over her, which is all right to those who believe
the priest should rule. Yes, spirits both in the
body and out, gather this sex&mdash;this psychic aura to
increase the power of those who now hold the world
in chains, and will till sex life is understood.</p>

<p>As to religious revivals, show me one in which
the participants are all of one sex and I will concede
that sex is not the basis of revivals. Show me a successful
circle of Spiritualists sitting week after week,
all men or all women, and I will concede that sex is
not the connecting link between this and spirit life.</p>

<p>Show me that all growth from lower to higher,
now and all through the ages, has not come through
the law of sex, and I will concede that legal morality,
that church measured morality is true morality. In
a word, I maintain that we must have a new standard
of morality, prove false to present standard, or cease
to grow. That which health demands is moral.</p>

<p>There is one point in connection with sex viril,
sex aura, that I must not fail to notice. Such as is
evolved without the parties having a definite purpose
in life beyond mere material success, and all that is
evolved by those who have a purpose not antagonistic
to the church, becomes in some degree a sustainer
of church power, while such as is evolved by those
who positively and intelligently oppose church claims

<!-- page 63 -->

cannot be thus appropriated, and in this lies one
cause for the opposition to such workers. Any and
every means that can safely be used to put them down
will be resorted to. All that a man hath will he give
for his life, and all that an institution hath will it use
to perpetuate its life.</p>

<p>Anthony Comstock is a chosen medium for the
church hierarchy in spirit life, and what is called the
Comstock postal law is a deliberate plot of said
hierarchy who, in conjunction with the church dignitaries
of this life, seek to destroy all whose purpose is
to bless humanity instead of churchanity. While
caring nothing for the abuse of sex, but only that it
be not diverted from their use, they cunningly made
use of the general feeling against those who purposely
pollute the minds of the young to get this postal
law passed, but they have so worded it that with
Christian Juries and a Christian Judge in the chair
everything that is in opposition to Christianity could
be pronounced "immoral" and thus the parties sending
it through the mails be condemned. The law says:</p>

<p>"All obscene and <i>immoral</i> literature." "Oh but
that will never be done," says the reader. Several
things of which this has been said have already been
done. Already a clairvoyant physician has been arrested
for using the mails in connection with his business,
the lords of the postal service deciding that the
claim of diagnosing disease at a distance is a false one.
The battle is on, and it is three sided.</p>

<p>It is not only between Christianity and the growing
thought of the age, but between the gods of the
East and that of the Christians, the latter claiming

<!-- page 64 -->

everything, while the former seem willing to divide
the dominion over earth's inhabitants.</p>

<p>While the followers of Jesus have been busy in
the East among the lower classes, the ideas of the
educated classes there are making their way westward
and finding lodgement in some of the best minds of
this country. This gives us another religion to watch,
for while this Eastern philosophy is a formidable opponent
to Christian pretention, we have but to look
into the condition of the masses there to see that Theosophy
does not solve the problem of Humanity.</p>

<p>For further proof of our position, we have only
to look at the hierarchies of wealth in this life, to note
the preparations being made to crush any uprising of
the people, to know, (the laws of mind being the
same) that the same efforts are being made there to
prevent all investigation of such questions as tend to
free the people here from the law of authority; and
the fact that sex is at the base of all life, that an understanding
of its laws will enable people to so use
their own creative forces as to build themselves
up instead of using them carelessly, or allowing
them to go out on the lines of worship to aid others
in holding exalted positions at the foot of which
they must bow as subjects. This of itself is sufficient
to show why honest, true-hearted men and women are
persecuted for investigating the laws that govern this
universal life force.</p>

<p>Letters, experiences, histories, with comments
on the same, will now follow.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">EXPLANATORY.</p>

</div>

<p>The reader will please understand that though
exact copies of what I have received, the following
letters in no case bear the true name of the writer.
I should use no names but for my own convenience
in referring to the different ideas expressed. That
the experiences given could be multiplied a millionfold,
the worst still being left out of sight, is unquestionably
true.</p>

<p>Civilization is one vast sepulcher of human souls,
yes, I mean just that&mdash;souls&mdash;that part of ourselves
which, connected with, permeated by sex life, becomes
the center of the emotions and the channel
through which the spirit, the real selfhood manifests
in the flesh. The letters I here give have been received
in reply to questions like the following:</p>

<p>"Dear Sir, or Madam: I am writing another
book and I would like your opinion upon some points,
first stating the following case:</p>

<p>"Some years since I met a lady who was living
with her second husband, having a divorce from the
first one. In speaking of the cause which made her
leave the first husband, she said: 'He would go with

<!-- page 66 -->

other women and I always knew when as it gave me
such a pain in my womb.'</p>

<p>" 'At the time, or afterward when he came to
you,' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'At the time, I tested the matter again and
again, telling him just when, and he could not deny
it,' was her reply.</p>

<p>"Now, do you know of any such cases? I know
of one more, not exactly like this, but similar. Also,
will you please tell me what you think of the effect of
mixed sex relations by the husband upon the nerves
of a sensitive, finely organized woman, she not suspecting
anything of the kind. Would it or would it
not tend to make her irritable, nervous, unreasonable,
she herself wondering why?</p>

<p>"Again: What do you think of the general
effect of variety in sex relations? I do not mean
public prostitution but such <i>select</i> variety as many
free-lovers practice. For instance, suppose a woman
who has a husband and children, a woman posing as
a teacher of advanced ideas&mdash;suppose she goes from
home, makes love to or accepts it from two men in
the same building, as I have known to be done, she
claiming it as her right, what is likely to be the
effect upon the wives of those men, upon the men
themselves, and eventually upon the woman? If you
have any facts bearing upon variety relations please
give them together with such suggestions as will aid
in discovering the true law of sex association."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The reader will perceive from the above that
while in search of truth for its own sake, I am really

<!-- page 67 -->

hoping to find evidence that variety in sex relations
is not the path to the best results. Now to the letters.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">DR. JOHN TABER'S LETTERS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. W:&mdash;</span>I have yours of the 17th, and in answer
will say that I never knew of such a case as that you
refer to as feeling pain or physical suffering of any kind on
the part of the wife after her husband has had connection
with somebody else, and then had connection with her. I
was consulted once by a lady who was very much affected
mentally, that is to say, she was very jealous, and the way
she seemed to be aware of it was that it occasioned an unpleasant
odor about her vagina, or at least, she thought it
did. She was very sure it did. I should say the physiological
law in the matter unless affected by the tastes and prejudices
of the parties is this: The association of a married
person with one outside, if that association has taken place
purely from attraction, is to change the polarity of that individual,
and cause the married partner even greater pleasure
in cohabitation, but I should put particular emphasis on
the fact there is no feeling against this kind of thing. I
have known of plenty of facts to substantiate this view,&mdash;patients
who have reported to me that they have tried it
and in many instances have overcome apathy by that
means. In one case of a party in &mdash;&mdash; the husband confided
to me the facts as follows: He married a lady to
whom he was greatly attracted, and in a few years she became
nearly bed-ridden with all kinds of difficulties. He
sent her to several sanitariums, and while she improved
when thus absent from him she soon became just about as
bad physically on returning home. She became intimate
with a clerk in his store, at the outset without his knowledge
and he was very much astonished to find his wife improving
in health, and that she was enjoying sexual relations
with him which had not been the case previously.</p>

<p>His wife, unable to bear up under the deception she

<!-- page 68 -->

was practicing, finally informed him of what was going on.
As a matter of course, he suffered very much from this
confession, and he wrote to me to know whether I would
advise him to let the affair go on.</p>

<p>From what you say, it is evident that you are by nature
a monogamist. There are those of both sexes who are so
born. On the other hand, I consider it no more strange that
there should be varietists among women than among men.
They are children perhaps of the same parents, come from
the same ancestral stock, and so if the boys are polygamic
in their desires and tastes, I see no reason why the girls
should not be polyandrists in their propensities. Many a
woman has confessed to me that she was that very way inclined.
Whether the monogamic relation is the highest, or
otherwise, I am not prepared to say. It may be that it is,
<i>but in the present stage of human progress</i> I think there are
more polygamists or varietists, if you choose, among both
men and women than there are of strict monogamists. I
do not mean to say that more practice polygamy than monogamy
for there are undoubtedly many conscientious people
reared under the monogamic plan who feel that it is
wrong to follow out the bent of their inclinations and as a
result live strictly monogamic lives.</p>

<p>I think you would be compelled to take the view that I
do if you sat in my chair and had the same opportunity to
hear people let themselves out in talking up these questions.
If you will refer to what I say in &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; in
regard to monogamy, polygamy and free love you will see
exactly the position I have been compelled to take by facts
coming directly under my observation. I cannot say that I
know of an instance precisely like the one you state on your
second sheet, but I have known of those which were not
materially different so far as the principle involved is concerned.</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly,<br/>

<span class="smcap">John Taber</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The particular case I related and to which the

<!-- page 69 -->

doctor refers is where the wife and another, woman
were friends. The wife took care of both families of
children while the woman and the husband traveled
and earned the money for their support. On the
nights when the husband was at home with his wife
the other woman would have spasms of the womb till
it would take two or three to take care of her.</p>

<p>The learned and widely known doctor, without
seeming to be aware of it has answered my question
so far as the tendency of variety relations is concerned.
He shows that it may be disintegrating to
harmonious unions, for if a new relation will change
the polarity and restore a broken circuit, it is liable
to change the polarity and break relations that are
rightly adjusted. The logic is unanswerable.</p>

<p>I am not now searching for that which will restore
broken or partly broken attractions. I believe
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
There are a great many things in the doctor's "change
of polarity" case which are not known, things that
should be fully understood before its real significance
can be estimated.</p>

<p>First: Had the husband ever sexualized with
another to so change the polarity that it needed to be
changed back, or had he in the first place allowed his
"strong attraction" to over-crowd the wife. There
was a cause somewhere for her condition; what was
it? Was her restoration permanent or only temporary,
and did she continue to hold the relation with
both men&mdash;all this and more needs to be known in
order to a correct decision.</p>

<p>I am aware of the terrible mixed up condition of

<!-- page 70 -->

sex life; and I am also aware that we as a people are
living far below our capabilities, far below the best in
many other directions than that of sex, then so much
the more need for asking the why and wherefore.</p>

<p>Another point: If a sexual polarity can be
changed it can be pulled upon without being changed;
and as we are sensitive beings, and as the nerves connected
with the sex organs are the most sensitive of
all, such pulling must cause intense suffering. Is not
that the philosophy of what is called jealousy, of
spasms of the womb, etc.</p>

<p>Yet again: The learned doctor did not read my
question aright. In the case referred to it was not
afterward when the husband came to the wife that
she had the pain of which she complained, but at the
very time he was having connection with another woman,
and if such connection pulls upon the "polarity"
but is not strong enough to break it that would be
the time a <i>very</i> sensitive wife would feel it. But
enough comment on this letter. The Dr. replies to a
personal letter in a way that shows he is not pleased
with my application of his "polarity" idea, but I do
not see how, if his premises are correct, he is going
to get away from the conclusions drawn. He writes
as follows:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Feb</span>. 14, 1895.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lois Waisbrooker</span>,</p>

<p>Dear Madam:&mdash;I have yours of the 6th. You say if it
will change polarity and restore broken relations, it will
also change polarity and break harmonious relations. When
there is proper adaptation between the sexual mates I do
not think this is probable. It is not according to my observation.
So far as married people are concerned, when

<!-- page 71 -->

the adaptation is what it should be, the home and other associations
become such that there is little danger of their being
drawn away from them. Even when adaptation is not
good, I find there is quite a disposition for a married couple
to hang together. I have sometimes remarked that for the
benefit of the unborn it would be well if there were a commission
appointed by the state to pull people apart who are
not properly adapted to each other, there is such a tendency
when people are once married, to cling together.</p>

<p>The pulling that you speak of is due to nothing more
nor less than jealousy. You say that it is dubbed jealousy
for convenience. Well, now, what is it but jealousy? If
a person really loves another, he will be pleased to see that
other person happy, even if he himself does not personally
participate in that happiness. If a person is aware that
his companion is being made very happy by somebody, he
will not feel any uncomfortable pulling unless he loves himself
more than he loves his companion, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The woman you instance is a sensitive, a sort of clairvoyant
who knows by her impressions what is going on,
and when she realizes by these impressions what is going
on her jealousy is aroused, and she suffers. I do not think
where there is any attraction outside of true mateship, that
it disturbs the polarity injuriously to gratify that attraction.
I have had much observation in these matters, and
I have opportunities for forming opinions that many do not
possess.</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly,<br/>

<span class="smcap">John Taber</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"What is it but jealousy?" I really wish the
learned Doctor would give us a scientific diagnosis of
jealousy or what is called such in connection with the
love relations. If he can and will he will confer a
very great favor upon many a poor mortal. He says,
"what is it but jealousy," and I ask what is jealousy?
Once, and some are ignorant enough to think the
same now, once it was believed that hysteria was

<!-- page 72 -->

something to be laughed at. "What is the matter,"
would be asked of one who was suffering intensely,
and a bystander would reply contemptuously, "Oh,
it's nothing but hysterics."</p>

<p>It is now known to be a disease or weakness of
the nerves. In most cases it is the unsatisfied sex
nature transformed into a strength of emotion greater
than the nerves can bear and intense agony is the result
of the struggle. If sex feeling can be transformed
into religious emotion it can be transformed
into any other kind of emotion, for it is in fact the
life of the emotional nature. Hysteria in religious
revivals, hysteria connected with the love relations,
both come from unsatisfied or over wrought sex life.
It may be a mistake, this desire</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"For the blending of my being
With some soul I can adore."</p>

</div>

<p>It might be better if we could gather and move
on and leave no intertwining fibre, but there are few
who can do this, and the blending life which Swedenborg
calls conjugial, or the perfect love, seems to be
the ideal of the race, and when couples unite, if there
is any of this blending it is natural that they should
shrink from breaking the united tendrils in sunder
even if there is not full adaptation. The idea that
there should be a commission appointed by the state
to pull people apart is fully as sensible as that the
state should tie people together. It has no right to
do either when considered from the standpoint of
what should be instead of what is.</p>

<p>In the above, in the intertwining of one nature
with or around another, is a hint of the root of jealousy,

<!-- page 73 -->

of the suffering caused by the wounding of those
fibres. For a better understanding of the question at
issue between the Doctor and myself, I will introduce
another letter right here, one from a woman.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 21st, '93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Waisbrooker</span>:&mdash;As you are asking for experiences
perhaps mine will throw some light on the variety
question. I was married very young, have had three husbands,
the first much older than myself. I was never
crowded upon sexually by either of them, and never while
living with the first two did I receive the slightest caress
from another man. The third was a professed free-lover
and I became somewhat inclined to his views. We separated
and for years I sold books, sometimes lectured on
temperance and kindred subjects, but, having an intense
sexual nature, I did not live entirely alone.</p>

<p>When I say I have an intense nature, I do not mean
large demands, for once in a week or ten days was always
ample. I mean when I have a want it is an intense one.
And yet I have lived for months, and even years entirely
alone so far as sex is concerned. Only certain men could
affect me, and these were of two classes.</p>

<p>One would inspire me with merely physical desire;
that satisfied, the man was no more to me than though we
had merely taken a meal of victuals together. If circumstances
held us near each other for a time I was utterly indifferent
if I saw him caressing other women, and to part
with him caused no regret.</p>

<p>The other class, and I have had three such experiences,
seemed to take hold of my very soul. The fibres of my
life twined around and around them. I could not bear to
have them caress others, and the separation, one by death,
and the others from other causes, seemed to pull my very
life out of me. And here permit me to say that of all the
cruel positions a woman can occupy, it is to be unrecognized,
to be so situated she dare not let her feelings be

<!-- page 74 -->

known when the man she loves is in trouble, sick or dying.</p>

<p>For weeks, months, and even years I suffered whenever
I thought of those men, and the last one even yet occupies
hours and hours of my thoughts in the sleepless watches of
the night. Now why this difference?</p>

<p>I am living alone now. and probably shall continue to
do so, for the <i>mere</i> material relation has come to disgust me,
and to form another soul union with the danger of its being
broken, involves too much suffering.</p>

<p class="right">Yours for the truth,<br/>

<span class="smcap">VIRGINIA M&mdash;&mdash;</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>This letter surprised me exceedingly because the
writer told so much that I could understand, and
some things so like what I have myself experienced.
I wish women could open their hearts to each other
more fully. What a mine of thought would thus be
opened up. While this letter seems to me to touch
upon Doctor Taber's queries as I cannot find words
to do, I will also give my views.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the reason for the difference
of the feeling of the writer toward the two classes of
men is very obvious. It is the difference between
mere animal life and soul life. The physical, or mere
animal phase of sex life when not permeated with
the soul life of the human will admit of variety;
the truly human relation, that in which the spirit
blends, will not. Yet those who, having passed
through the variety plane, have repudiated it, are
called by those who are still satisfied with variety
"selfish," "haven't grown," "fallen back."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">DR. MARGARET SOULE'S LETTERS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Jan. 27, '93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. W:&mdash;</span>Your favor at hand, and will say that
as much as I desire to aid you in your good work, I do not
wish to appear on record in answer to the questions you
ask, for several reasons.</p>

<p>I have known cases similar to the ones referred to but
am confident that <i>jealousy</i> was the power behind the throne.</p>

<p>I do not experimentally <i>know</i> anything about the effect
of mixed sex magnetisms. I know some healthy and
seemingly happy people who willingly make exchange in
that direction, and I do not know that mixed sex magnetisms
are more depleting to the nerves than a constant irritation
by unwelcome but so-called legitimate magnetism.
The worst wrecks I have ever treated have been of the
latter class.</p>

<p>There is no basis for sex union, according to my idea,
but that of desire based on mutual attraction, and relations
otherwise indulged are an offense to nature. I believe
<i>many</i> cases of insanity are due to the abuse of these laws.</p>

<p>I am not a varietist, but I regard marriage a grand
farce, and as such has no legal, moral or any other <i>claim</i> to
sex expression. I dare not write you in full all I know and
feel on this subject. It is too great a risk, for one <i>always</i>
risks being misunderstood, to say the least. Do not use my
name in connection with anything I say here. If I ever meet
you again I'll dare to <i>talk</i> all I know. Till then excuse me
from committing myself.</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>Hoping your book will be a great help in time of need
to many lives, I am yours truly.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Margaret Soule</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, if physicians would, or dare, tell what they
know what a revelation it would be! But, as they will
not and do not dare, the sacrifice upon the altar of
ignorance continues unabated!</p>

<p>The lady evidently does not understand my position,
or she would not have deemed it necessary to
give me her idea of sex relations that have only legality
behind them; but where she says of such relations
"when indulged they are an offense to nature," I
should say "endured" for there is no "indulgence in," but
a shrinking from, and an endurance of an unwelcome
relation, on the part of the woman. The man tries to
obtain the satisfaction that only mutual desire can
give, fails, and endures the effect afterward.</p>

<p>It needs not to say that such relations are destructive
to body and soul, and the finer, the more highly
developed, the more spiritual the parties, the keener
the suffering, the more injurious the relation.</p>

<p>The question I am trying to solve is how to preserve
mutual relations when once formed, and the reply
involves the causes which tend to break them up.
There are many men and women who are easily influenced&mdash;are
psychologized. Such men and women
may have formed mutual love relations that they
would be very sorry to have broken up, but, becoming
temporarily influenced by another party, and believing
they have a right to respond, they do so, and
by doing so are liable to take home an element which
naturally destroys the sex love of the companion.</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>Had the party supposed there was danger of
such a result nothing could have induced such a compliance
with the temporary attraction. For the sake
of the happiness of those who desire that their love
relations should not needlessly be broken up is it not
important that this question be understood?</p>

<p>Re-stating the question: Is there anything in
mixed sex-magnetism&mdash;the magnetism of some other
person mingled with that of the companion which
tends, irrespective of the action of the mind, to destroy
sex love even as alkali tends to neutralize or destroy
acid. I do not ask if it is necessarily so, but is
it not likely to be so?</p>

<p>If it is true that there may be&mdash;is quite likely to
be such a result, and lovers learn that this is so, they
will then be careful not to mingle sexually with others
so long as they desire the continuation of the relation
then held.</p>

<p>"But I am confident that jealousy was the power
behind the throne. "</p>

<p>Here again jealousy is made to do service in explaining
what is not understood.</p>

<p>What is jealousy? Is it not a diseased condition
of the love nature caused by a violation of love's laws?
Who violated those laws? Who turned the currents
of her life&mdash;for love is life&mdash;awry? And yet the condition
of the sufferer is made worse by unkindness.
Inverted love currents&mdash;lines which pull and tug at
the heart strings and yet will not break. Oh, the
terrible suffering, and yet this agony is spoken of in
terms of contempt. A jealous woman. It is one of
the terms that have been used drive her back into

<!-- page 78 -->

herself, to hold her in subjection.</p>

<p>While a relation that is not mutually desired can
never be justified the idea that mutual attraction always
sanctions the sex act needs to be studied in all
its bearings. Hypnotic drawing is sometimes mistaken
for real attraction; we must not be ruled by
feeling when the judgment does not sanction. A
woman who divorced one husband and married again
said to me not long since:</p>

<p class="small">I did not want my first husband only when I was in
his presence. I dreaded the marriage and cried like a child
while making my wedding clothes, but as soon as I was with
him it was all right. I now know I was simply psychologized.
He wanted me and when where I was, controlled me.</p>

<p>At the time neither party understood it, but it
was none the less true that it was not the mutuality
which naturally blesses. I know of another where an
intelligent lady, out of health and in trouble, fell
temporarily under the psychological influence of a
strong man and believed herself attracted. Very
soon she saw his real character and then the re-action
came. From that time on till the day of her death
the very thought of that man was a horror to her.</p>

<p>I know of two others, both lovely women, who
were psychologized into marriage, and the <span class="smcap">will</span> which
first controlled them continued to hold them. One
of the men is dead. I shall not be sorry when I hear
the other one is, for he is much older than the woman
he calls his wife, and when he steps out she may possibly
see a few days of comfort.</p>

<p>So while the lack of attraction makes a clear case
against sex relations, attraction, or what seems to be

<!-- page 79 -->

such, needs to be well analyzed as to its real nature.
Now another letter from Doctor Soule.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 19-93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. W.</span> Your letter has awaited a reply
for sometime. Lack of time being one reason, and the
assurance that I cannot give you what you wish another.
I have found that when one has thought out a line of morals
or laws governing the sex relations as you have, conflicting
opinions are apt to irritate. You are right, my sister, in
your research as to the causes of destruction to mutual relations,
and I trust may get at the bottom of things. I have
been forced to different conclusions from what I infer
you have. I regard the sexual expression as an intellectual
and spiritual exchange (as you do) as well as bodily, but I
do not believe that one person can fully fill the needs of another
in that respect. I am a believer in variety but not in
promiscuity. [Promiscuous, without choice. No woman is
that naturally; it comes from outside pressure.]</p>

<p>I think if my husband visited another woman on my
plane of thought, and one who was my friend, I should not
be hurt by such relations nor would she; but if he went far
below me morally and spiritually as well as intellectually
for such relations, I might be hurt. I really think the fact
that men sneak away to other women, leaving the wife to
find it out as best she can, thereby arousing jealousy, or
thus "wounds" the love nature, is the trouble more than
variety is.</p>

<p>One thing all sex students should bear in mind is the
fact that, barring the <i>one disease</i> prostitutes are liable to,
they are healthier than married women, and this on such a
low scale of morals as that. I think in the spirit world we
will draw to us what we need when we need it in that direction
as well as others. The personal experiences of
many have carried me a long way from monogamy.</p>

<p>I know of lives being saved by variety, not one but
many. I know of hundreds dying by inches from <i>sameness</i>

<!-- page 80 -->

falsely called <i>virtue</i>, and this too where love ruled for years
till the sex nature began to rebel against the one kind of
food that no longer filled body, brain, or spirit. I know
that I shall appear in your eyes a sinner of sinners, but you
will know how I see things.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Margaret Soule</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>If the dear lady knows her facts no better than
she knows I shall look upon her as "a sinner of sinners,"
she does not know them very well. She says
she delayed her reply because she could not give me
what I wanted. I wanted the truth. I presume she
has given me the honest result of her observation and
experience as a physician, and we shall never get at
the bottom of this question of questions till we are
not only permitted but induced to give what we know
without fear of being condemned.</p>

<p>People are not necessarily sexual sinners because
they do not live up to or believe in an established
standard. When the causes of persistent evils are
sought for, standards must be investigated if said
causes cannot be otherwise reached. Standards are
often set up which upon investigation prove to be
false. New facts are likely to upset old theories, or
will if we give them due weight, but this we are not
always able to do because of deeply rooted prejudices.</p>

<p>The genuine seeker for truth must not allow
prejudice to bear sway. It is the truth that I want
no matter where it leads me. Still I see nothing in
Doctor Soule's letters to militate against the dual
ideal. In her concluding paragraph she only shows
that nature had divorced parties who should no longer
mate sexually but who remain together because of
outside pressure. That those who no longer satisfy

<!-- page 81 -->

each other should not continue to live together as sex
companions is a self-evident truth patent to all unprejudiced
thinkers.</p>

<p>The question is not, should those remain together
whom nature has divorced, but have they in their ignorance
brought about nature's decree; have they by
bringing in foreign elements divorced that which once
blended in harmony? It is possible in some material
combinations to form a union between two discordant
substances by introducing a third, as in the
case of water and oil, but their lack of union is inherent.
They do not unite for a time and then separate
because of satiety.</p>

<p>Alkali will combine with water and oil and we
have soap as the result, which is neither of the three
but something entirely different, but human beings
do not, cannot so blend. Sex is creative either physically,
mentally, or spiritually and when a union no
longer creates in any one of these departments it is
no longer of any use to either party. Men and women
must continue to create in some line or death ensues.
It needs not to be another human being that is
created nor is bodily contact always necessary.</p>

<p>Now the question is, if the perfect union of one
man with one woman in all three of the above departments
of our life, be the ideal&mdash;if in such union
there is generated health for body, soul and spirit,
what steps are necessary to actualize this ideal, and
what acts do, or may, retard such actualization? And
further, have we a right to demand that people shall
live, even the true ideal until it is reached by growth?
Shall we continue to insist upon the semblance in the

<!-- page 82 -->

absence of the real, or shall we accept what is, and
wait for growth to bring us what should be, doing
the while, what we can to remove from the path
all that tends to impede growth?</p>

<p>This last seems to me the better way, but before
closing this chapter I will give another woman's ideas,
not a physician, but widely known as a thinker.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 16&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lois:&mdash;</span>I send you some facts as called for, and
if you had all that could be given a large volume could not
half hold them. There are points of science connected with
such experiences.</p>

<p>As woman develops mentally and spiritually, a finer,
more sensitive physical system unfolds which readily connects,
comes into rapport with those it touches, and hence
is conveyed to those touched by the other party. Sexual exchange
by coition is of so vital a nature that vitality must
sustain it. The sensitive one being the most loving and
giving is the main sustainer.</p>

<p>When two women are in communication with a man,
the wife, if loving and sensitive, having long been in rapport
with him, is likely, however unwillingly, to give of her
vitality to sustain his act with the other and she directly
feels the loss, together with the bad conditions of body and
mind of both parties, which come to her in deathly pains
that locate at the vagina, uterus or heart.</p>

<p>I once lived in the house with a victim who suffered
this. When it struck at what seemed the heart she felt and
looked as if dying, would drop into a chair, her hands falling
powerless to her side. This continued about a half an
hour followed by weakness for several hours. If I asked her
what was the matter, she would say: "My destroyer has a
harlot in his arms again." Her health declined so much
that she left him, went to her parents and employed a magnetic
healer. She was much helped for awhile, but when

<!-- page 83 -->

the healer married, she then had similar pains and she refused
further treatment.</p>

<p>Through written correspondence by those who have
never met, similar pains have been felt. Selfish men have
caught hints from mental science and have experimented
<i>willing</i> an indulgence through letters of loving pretense.
Women thus insulted who do not hurl back a rebound of
curses are simply foolish.</p>

<p>I will relate a different case. A good woman that I
knew was given syphilis by her husband. She left him and
put herself under the care of a physician and was pronounced
cured. Fearing her blood was infected she took
treatment of a botanic physician for a year. Several years
afterward she had a mutual attraction for a good man but
declined marriage, informing him of her fear that her system
was affected still as her legs continued to feel clumsy.
He finally prevailed on her by saying he was willing to take
the risk. As soon as they were married her clumsiness
disappeared and his commenced, soon followed by nodes on
the ankles which became spreading sores and he lived but
a few months. She lived several years but in time her ankles
became sore and never got well. This strengthens the
statement that sex contagion can never be fully cured.</p>

<p class="right">Yours,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Lydra Dean</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In reference to "willing an indulgence" as spoken
of above, I have a letter in my possession which I will
give further on, in which the party speaks of having
a mutual arrangement with another to "mentally project
ourselves in the divine embrace." Several years
ago I heard a man say that he had gone out in the
spirit and held the sexual relation with a friend at a
distance, and his wife remarked that her husband was
controlled by so many different ones she never knew
who was in bed with her.</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>These things seem strange but I believe them to
be true. It is but a few months since I heard a lady
tell of her physician visiting her in that way. She
said: "I knew it was impossible for him to reach
me in his physical body, besides he could not have
come to me in body and sexualized without waking
me. It was the culmination on my part which awoke
me, and as I awoke I sensed him going from me. I
charged him with it the next day and his reply was:
'I know it.' "</p>

<p>That "there are more things in heaven and earth
than our philosophy has dreamed of," I find to be
"o'er true." It is well, however, considering the
plane that most men are on, that but few women are
as sensitive as was the one whose experience is given
by Lydra Dean, but that many women are thus more
or less injured in health I do not in the least doubt.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">GOLDENA'S LETTERS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 14&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister:&mdash;</span>Yours of the 6th was duly received
and was indeed a surprise in more ways than one. I should
think a woman of your age would get so <i>tired</i> of that word
<i>sex</i> that you would want to retire it from the vocabulary. I
know you are doing a work which you believe necessary for
the uplifting of the world. When I used to believe that
commerce between the sexes was an absolute <i>necessity</i> I
thought so too. I do not so believe any longer. When human
beings get so they can live on a plane as high as the
brutes do, this whole matter will take care of itself.</p>

<p>All that is needed is a spiritual unfoldment and a forgetting
that men and women <i>as such</i>, exist. The race is a
unit and needs educating as such. As for personal experiences
I have none to give to the public and do not think
very highly of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; for his breach of confidence in
thus mentioning me to you. You say "no name would be
given." He claimed the same and yet gave mine to you
and I do not know how many more.</p>

<p>You did not say what your theory was that you wished
to prove, so I cannot tell which chapter of my eventful life
could be of service to you. I am willing to serve humanity
but I am not ready to be burned at the stake for it.</p>

<p>You once called me a narrow, contracted, jealous woman
because I wouldn't drive my husband out of my bed
into yours. He had my full consent all the time you were

<!-- page 86 -->

in my house, but he preferred my bed to yours and you
thought the fault was mine and didn't like me for it.</p>

<p>Your experiences, as you mention them, I do not think
are exceptional unless it be the clinging capacity&mdash;that I
know nothing of. Probably my nature is not as ardent as
yours. I used to suppose the sexual union the ultimate of
love, but I have been forced to believe that more than
anything else it kills it. Love, in its purity and truth,
needs no such expression. The attraction that demands
such is simply lust. Ignorance is the curse of the world,
but sometimes a system of education is commenced on entirely
wrong lines and we suffer intolerable agonies of body
and mind because we are seeking satisfaction and happiness
in an entirely false direction. I have been through all that
and learned my lesson. It has become thoroughly instilled
into my very life so I do not think I shall continue to make
the same mistakes.</p>

<p>Now I have done with those experiences and do not
care to dwell upon them. I cannot save others by opening
afresh old wounds. I prefer to lift others onto a plane high
enough that their feet may not touch, nor their clothing be
befouled by dragging through the mire I have waded
through. I do not blame you that we do not look through
the same glasses. Oh for the time when all these mysteries
will be made clear.

<p class="right">Fraternally,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Goldena</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The above was indeed a surprise to me. I had
no recollection of ever having met the lady, but if
she had been restored to health in the way S. S. L.
stated I wanted to know the causes which led to her
ill health and the outcome. I had simply her name
and city&mdash;didn't know as I could reach her, but I did.
In her remark about my experience, she mistakes. I
gave her those instances I have given elsewhere, and
the woman who was divorced, and the one who combined

<!-- page 87 -->

with the man and his wife were both as different
in temperament from what I am as could well be
possible. The first named is dead, and the other
one is somewhere in Arizona, if living.</p>

<p>I give the above letter just as written because,
under our present enslaved condition as women, it
shows how much we are in the power of unprincipled
men if we do not happen to please them, or if they
want to blind a wife's eyes. I call her Goldena because,
since I have learned who she is, my memory
of her is like that of a rich, velvety flower with a golden
center. But to her next letter, for of course I replied
and asked an explanation.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 18&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister Lois</span>.&mdash;Yours of the 15th received and I
see I have given you the impression that I have treasured
unkind thoughts of you all these years. May be we are not
so old but we may get to know each other yet. Your letter
is an "astonishment" to me. In those days it had never
entered my head to doubt a word of what my husband told
me. I did learn later on to take a good many things with
many degrees of allowance. You stayed at my house two
weeks about twenty-two years ago when we lived in &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I was a new born babe in Spiritualism then and of
course anything not in strict accordance with my old orthodox
ideas gave me something of a shock and so left an impression.
My husband has been in the spirit world&mdash;years
and I hope he has learned many things that he failed to
learn while here. I have no desire to harm him or to cause
him a moment's pain there, so I do not censure him although
his ignorance was the cause of years of suffering to
me which is not pleasant to recall.</p>

<p>I have never taken pleasure in parading before the
world any eccentricities of thought or act which belonged

<!-- page 88 -->

to any woman. Men I thoroughly despise. I have fought
this world for&mdash;years for an existence, and I have never
found one man who would use his money or his influence
to get me a position in which I could earn a living without
first wanting to take a mortgage on my person, and if that
could not be accomplished I must look elsewhere for help;
or, if I yielded, then grew tired of my bondage and broke
the fetters in ever so gentle a manner, he was the one to be
hurt and I was ungrateful.</p>

<p>Love! My hungry heart has cried out for it from
childhood and I have been fooled into supposing I had it,
but the cloven foot of lust has soon trampled every semblance
 of the pure flower into the mud and mire until I am
almost forced to believe there is no more reality in its existence
than there is in the existence of happiness.</p>

<p>But enough. This is not what you want. Now I know
your theory I quite agree with you. There is no love in sex
variety, but there may be material benefit, physical strength
may be gathered by an absorption of magnetic currents
which a woman's physical condition may demand, and
which come with greater force accompanied by novelty
than with familiarity. How S. S. L. could have so construed
my experience I cannot understand, only as I know
that every man will construe everything to suit himself,
and make an excuse for his own desires. Let me see if you
will understand me.</p>

<p>Before my husband's death I was a physical wreck and
thought I could never have any use for a man again. Nor
had I, but my heart cried out for love, love, give me love,
but there was no answer. I had always been told I was a
medium and would yet have to do the spirit's work. I was
left alone, without a home, without a dollar and almost
without a friend, for my relatives had no place for me because
of my religion.</p>

<p>When I had my family I had no time to follow directions
for development, but now I said if there is anything
of me that the spirits can use it shall be theirs: I will follow

<!-- page 89 -->

their directions as nearly as possible. I soon found myself
where I could join a developing circle. Mediumship
began to display itself. I was told I must be passive, had
no use for will power, must throw open the door and let
everything in.</p>

<p>While all this was going on I had my living to earn.
This was when I found out what men were. I only wonder
that I escaped the lunatic asylum. I had some strange experiences.
Whenever I would pray to my spirit friends to
send me some work or something by which food would
come, some man would invariably appear. The chasm
would be bridged over, and I got acquainted with some men
who occupied positions where such a thing was never
thought of them.</p>

<p>In this way I sometimes got means enough to enable
me to lay aside worry and care for a little time, <i>then</i> I would
drink in the strength. It did not seem to hinder my development
[no, helped it as a hot-bed hastens germination]
and I concluded that the spirits certainly could not look at
these things as we did, for I hated the whole thing and myself
more than all for having to live a hypocritical life. But
live I must for those who knew my necessities hugged their
purse strings and left me to the mercy of the storm.</p>

<p>For a time my health improved. The variety kept me
from <i>thinking</i>. Making myself pleasant, agreeable and attractive
kept me from growing morbid. But as soon as the
spirits got so they could use me they released me from
these conditions, and I said emphatically this ends this
kind of life. No more of it for me, and more than that,
no man lives who shall crush me for this chapter of my experience.
I have struggled through everything since, poverty,
loneliness, miserable health, yet I am better than for
many years when I lived the other life. I long for love and
home as much as I ever did but never expect to have them.</p>

<p>As you say, the perversion of that which was intended
for good is ruining the world, but a greater perversion will
not save it. When the world reaches a point where it demands

<!-- page 90 -->

the same code of morals for man as for woman, then
both will rise to a higher plane of spirituality, and everything,
sex and all else will be valued for its spiritual
uses and the world would be the better for it. Your books
are doing good work in that line. I hardly see where you
can make any use of this, but perhaps you will see.</p>

<p>And now, sister Lois, I do not believe you will respect
me less for what I have written. It is not a pleasant subject
for me to recall; indeed it has been my constant study
to get away from it, but if there is a lesson in it for anyone
else I ought not to withhold it. Like you, I want to do
some good, but publicity would ruin me entirely and I do
not deserve that.</p>

<p class="right">Yours fraternally,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Goldena</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>So much for the woman who "was a physical
wreck and expected to die any day but sexual commerce
with strong men brought her back to health."</p>

<p>Her story does not give any such idea, but it
makes my heart ache as I read it; and the most pitiful
of all is, "And now, sister Lois, I do not believe
you will respect me less for what I have written."</p>

<p>In that sentence is a covert pleading that I will
not, a sort of confession that her self-respect has been
terribly wounded. Poor golden oriole, as I remember
her bright face! But she needs to learn with Helen
Harlow that "no woman is ruined unless she
thinks so." If all mediums would tell their experiences
Goldena would not stand alone by considerable,
even if publicity were given to hers. No, I do not
mean to say that mediums are naturally more sensual
than others, but as sensitives they are more likely
to speak and act what others feel; they really carry
the 'infirmities' of others in a greater degree than
any other class of people.</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>When I was in her home Goldena lived far from
where she is now, and soon after that they moved to a
distant state and I had entirely lost track of them;
when I wrote her I had no idea I was writing to one
in whose home I had once been kindly cared for.</p>

<p>When her reply came I of course wrote and asked
an explanation. I have a much better memory of her
face than of her husband's, and at this distant date I
do not remember talking with him on the sex question;
I know I never called any woman "narrow, contracted,
jealous" for not being willing to give her husband
to the arms of another woman. As I see things,
when the true law of life is learned such a thing will
not be thought of.</p>

<p>As to Goldena's association with men, it was her
right if she so chose; was it best is another question,
but that she should feel forced into so doing to get
bread while developing as a medium, that from then
on she must feel the pangs of wounded self-respect is
where the pity of it comes in. She was a victim of
the development craze, of the idea that she must be
passive, have no use for her will. Spirits who wanted
to gather sex life for their own use took possession
of her&mdash;made her their tool. I have before said that
sex is the connecting link between this and spirit
life, and if mediums would only tell what they know
there would be no lack of evidence. But like the
doctors, they are tongue-tied.</p>

<p>But with all her experience, the dear sister does
not see the true use of sex. I am not in the least
surprised that she is disgusted with the physical expression&mdash;that
she should think genuine love does

<!-- page 92 -->

not need it. She has never had the soul love that,
descending into the physical, makes it the culminating
glory which gestates new life for body, soul and spirit;
she has fed upon husks and prefers to starve to
being fed thus any longer. Her hungry spirit will
some day be fed; somewhere she will find a love that
is holy&mdash;whole.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And now, permit me to say it is not a pleasant
task to give such letters as that which is next in order
but I called for experiences for a purpose, and to serve
that purpose I must not hide what I find to be the
real state of things. The man who writes me thus is
a product of our so-called civilization. He and others
are scattering far and wide the ideas embodied in that
letter, and as I happen to know, boast of making it a
business to teach girls sexual freedom, and from their
standpoint of course. The only way to bring good
out of evil is to hold it up to the light. Darkness
breeds worms and gives voice to owls. We have had
too much darkness thrown around the sex question.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 18&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comrade Lois:&mdash;</span>I will give you some personal experience.
Before I ever met freelovers I was married. We were
not in harmony. For most four years I knew no woman
but my wife though she was insanely jealous, yet I was attracted
to several. Well, my wife left me awhile and took
the girl, the apple of my eye. When she came back to me
she knew I had been with others, as she knew I had before
I went with her. I did not lie to her as did the character in
"Who lies." We live better since she came back, yet she is
jealous. I find that the knowledge I now possess is acceptable
to her. She used to deny that connection was agreeable

<!-- page 93 -->

to her. She now admits that it is. I never approach
her unless she admits that she wants me, and I always see
to it that she has full enjoyment, and I find I am much
more acceptable to her after I have been with other women
of the right sort, that is, women who are progressive and
sexually developed.</p>

<p>Of course I am compelled to lie to her, though I always
affirm my right to associate with other women, and I am
satisfied that she would be far more acceptable to me if she
would associate with other men. As it is she gets all the
benefit of my excursions into the realms of spirit and matter.
We are not sexual complements though I love her
and my child seems to be perfect in body and mind.</p>

<p>I think one great reason of our trouble is that she is
surrounded by a band of conservative spirits who use her
to plague me. I notice that though she is too fleshy to be
called handsome, she is very attractive to my male friends;
she abuses them, calls them names, etc. I think it is because
her astral, or spirit body lets them know she is in a
state of sexual starvation, but to that I cannot testify.
One of my friends knows it would be acceptable to me for
him to love her, yet while he admires her he is afraid of
her sharp tongue.</p>

<P>Another fact: One of my lovers and myself mentally
project ourselves to each other in the divine embrace. She
says at such times any man is acceptable to her, though she
is fastidious. She thinks my spirit acts through him. In a
less degree it is true in my case.</P>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that no one man or woman
can satisfy nature's great plan. Under our present system
I am compelled to starve or prostitute myself. When I
get crazy I prostitute myself and my experience is, it is the
lesser evil.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>I have given the exact meaning of Solomon's letter
and nearly the exact words. In two or three
places I have so changed a word or two as to take

<!-- page 94 -->

off some of the bare boldness, so to speak. But
will the reader compare the last paragraph but one
with what Lydra Dean says of getting into sex rapport
through correspondence.</p>

<p>It may seem a strange thing that a man should
say his wife would be more acceptable to him if she
associated with other men, but he is not the only man
I have known to feel thus, and he is talking what
many men act, and from that standpoint of life, the
most consistent party, for many men will visit public
women, and then, if the wife has a lover, repudiate
her.</p>

<p>I was talking with such a woman several years
since, and she said: "I can't understand it; men will
come and stay days with us, and then if the wife who
is left all alone, turns to some one else, she is no
longer good enough for them."</p>

<p>There is one thought comes in here, or a question
to be asked, to-wit. Is it advisable to try to increase
sex desire? If not, then here is an argument against
variety that I have not seen used; but Solomon's
statement that he is more acceptable to his wife after
he has been with others (and I have heard this said
before) is simply saying that he brings to her an element
which stimulates her passion.</p>

<p>My idea is that a man has no business with a woman
who does not respond to him when kindly treated
and left to take her own time; that is, not crowded
upon at first. Women should never be <i>held</i> to the
purely sensuous, and that is one reason why she
should be free, for in freedom she would naturally
meet men upon the sensuous plane only to lead him

<!-- page 95 -->

up with her to the soul plane, which is the seat of the
life giving love which all hunger for. The soul plane
has its sex center near the heart, is the center of the
affections. The intellectual sex center lies in the
brain, and its product is brilliant but cold unless the
physical life which is the stimulating force of the
brain center, passes up to it by the way of the soul
center, thus bringing warmth to blend with the light.</p>

<p>Solomon says: "I find the knowledge I now
have is acceptable to her." In other words, he knows
better how to treat a woman. The probability is that
had he known this at first there never need to have
been trouble between them. It is this ignorance that
we are trying to educate out of people, but the "powers
that be" are trying to prevent this, and hence the
conflict between us.</p>

<p>The ignorance of the people is the basis upon
which these powers are reared, and of course they do
not like the undermining.</p>

<p>But there is one thing that Solomon says to
which I wish to call attention. "I always see to it
that she has full enjoyment." If all men would do
this there would not be so many unwelcome children
as now, for with such a result on the woman's part
the chances of conception are many fold less.</p>

<p>I know I am talking plainly, but a subject of so
much importance needs to clothed in language that
can be understood, for when the lesson is rightly
learned this blind, staggering, sensuous condition will
be changed to one of self-conservation, respect and.
power. When we once come to so understand sex
law that no one can rob us of our sex life, we shall

<!-- page 96 -->

have become the triumphant conquerors of all evil.
Another point, for my readers will say that I
make variety work both ways, kill the wife's sex love
and stimulate it. It does; it destroys it with some
natures and stimulates it in others, but I do not regard
either as a healthy, normal condition.</p>

<p>But before closing this chapter I will give another
illustration of what Lydra says:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 15&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Waisbrooker:&mdash;</span>Your "wanted" gets me out of
my usual reticence on such subjects, although I think they
ought to be discussed with perfect freedom. Now as to the
"wanted."  I am a woman living away from my husband
because he is a drunkard. Now I have a lover, a young
man, younger than myself. He wishes me to marry him,
but, although I love him, he is too young for me, and I have
two little girls and he does not like children.</p>

<p>Now the strange part of the whole thing is I can tell
every time he goes to some woman for sexual intercourse
because I am conscious of an ejaculation at the very time of
his and his partners in the act. This makes me&mdash;well no
word but <i>mad</i> at myself, will express it. I am perfectly
unconscious sometimes until the climax, and so true is it
that I look at the clock, and am just brave enough to tell
him when.</p>

<p>He promises to overcome his actions in that direction
and as it now occurs so infrequently, I think he will either
be converted to my belief, "Dianism," or I will get over it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bess</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>I think in this case it is because the man's mind
is upon her. It is her he wants and not the woman he
is with, and his strong desire projects his soul or
astral body to her. In body he embraces the other
one, in spirit he embraces her. Her astral body does
not repel his, hence the result.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">DOCTORS DADE, HAGUE AND OTHERS.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Jan. 30&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. W.&mdash;</span>Yours of the 17th inst. received. The
cases you recite are interesting but not in accord with my
experience. Am I to understand that the lady felt the
pain in her sexual parts [womb] at the very moment her
husband was enjoying a sexual embrace with another woman,
and having no other reason for thinking he was thus
engaged? If so, I regard it as a very interesting case. One
strange thing is that she did not continue to feel it after
the divorce the same as before, the act of separation being
only formal, could not essentially affect the nature of the
lady. If the pain was felt only when the man was in the
sexual act with his wife I would conclude that his previous
pleasure acted on his mind when he was with his wife and
gave him more force and sexual power which might hurt
his wife physically. I believe that mental and physical
power is increased by variety.</p>

<p>I know a woman partially insane who tells me that
she hears voices telling her when her husband is with another
woman or girl and she feels, sometimes pain, but
more frequently sexual desire attended with an orgasm
and depression after it, but I regarded this as an insane
idea due to a perverted love nature. I think there are
more women insane from perversions of the love nature
than all other causes put together. If we knew just how

<!-- page 98 -->

to treat our sex natures and sex organs we could be <i>healthy</i>,
<i>holy</i> and <i>happy</i>.</p>

<p>In the present perverted state of society the wonder is
that people are as good and healthy as they are. I do not
believe a perfectly healthy man or woman can be born or
exist under our present social status. I believe intelligent
variety vastly better than enforced monogamy. People
marry and cohabit at random. They have no guide either
natural or acquired, hence there is a great deal of sex intercourse
that should not occur even if people are magnetically
congenial. Nude contact with a male, a friend, will be
beneficial in generating force, but it is much more natural
and beneficial between two of the opposite sex when they
are every way well adapted to each other, otherwise their
contact may be injurious.</p>

<p>I do not think <i>variety</i> in cohabitation necessarily makes
a woman peevish and cross any more than with one man,
if the conditions are right for variety. I know plenty of
women who say they seldom enjoy intercourse with their
husbands, though they pretend to, yet they do enjoy with
other men <i>really</i> without pretense, and when they dream of
it, it is never with the husband that they enjoy in sleep,
but often a coachman or servant.</p>

<p>Do you favor the use of the three plain, common sex
words in <i>private</i> conversation or correspondence? I have
several "scraps" that might be interesting and useful to
you if not objectionable on that ground.</p>

<p>I would like to write more but cannot at this time.</p>

<p class="right">Pantarchically yours,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Richard Dade</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Doctor Dade's signature shows him to be a disciple
of Stephen Pearl Andrews, a very intellectual
man, but too full of himself, it seems to me, to understand
woman's nature. He was another of those who
have attempted to show woman her place in the economy
of nature. When will man learn to take his

<!-- page 99 -->

hands off us and allow us to find our own place?</p>

<p>The Dr. asks as to the time the woman felt the
pain. That is told in the statement made as plainly
as words can tell it; yet I am asked over and over
if this pain was felt at the very time the husband was
with another woman or after it when he came to her?
When would the magnetic lines that unite a sensitive,
loving woman to her husband, be likely to be pulled
upon, when he was with her, or when with another?</p>

<p>No, the formality of a divorce would not change
the nature of the lady, but the cord when broken no
longer pulls. When she ceased to have connection
with the husband the pain ceased when he went
elsewhere, but the law still held her, hence the divorce.
Until that was granted the husband had the
legal right to enforce his claim upon her person.</p>

<p>This woman was no sexual bigot, but intelligent
and progressive above the average; a physician.</p>

<p>As to the second supposition of the Doctor's I
can conceive of its being true only of men who are
sexually like kept animals&mdash;men who live only for
pleasure and are incapable of other enjoyment than of
the physical senses.</p>

<p>That we have sex vampires, those who thrive on
the magnetism they gather and appropriate, I am satisfied
is true, and they are not all of the masculine
gender either. Years ago I knew a magnetic and
successful speaker who divorced one husband after
another, with the exception of the last who committed
suicide, this till she had the fifth one, each of the
others having been depleted till comparatively useless
in life. The last one, however, instead of giving her

<!-- page 100 -->

strength, depended upon her&mdash;drew from her. Her
career as a successful speaker soon came to an end.
In a few years she died, and soon after he suicided.</p>

<p>The fifth husband was a finely organized and fine
looking man, younger than herself, who had never
married, but from some cause had become impotent.
She thought she could restore him, but she failed.
Yet she loved him&mdash;loved, perhaps for the first time,
with soul love; but the unsatisfied physical&mdash;unsatisfied
where her love went&mdash;made her very unhappy.
Having learned to love, relations where love was not
but only physical passion, were no longer satisfactory.</p>

<p>Before this she had found that <i>variety</i>&mdash;for she
lived it more or less&mdash;"increased physical and mental
power."</p>

<p>Our Spiritualists will understand what the Doctor
says about the woman who said she heard voices.
There are many women who, being clairaudient and
clairvoyant, not only hear what is said but see what is
done. "Insane," or "jealous" is a very easy way of
accounting for what one does not understand.</p>

<p>As to the last question, I favor the use of no
language, no terms in private talk or correspondence
that I would not use in public print.</p>

<p>I agree with what the Doctor says in the fourth
paragraph of his letter, in reference to the present
perverted state of society, but I do not wonder that
it is perverted when a physician calling himself a reformer
can recommend nude contact between males
to generate force. Why not recommend Sodomy
and done with it?</p>

<p>Still another point which I have overlooked. The

<!-- page 101 -->

Doctor says: "I do not think variety necessarily
makes woman peevish and cross." My question was
not understood, consequently the above is not a reply.
I asked if the husband's variety did not tend to
bring elements to a sensitive wife&mdash;one highly and
finely organized, that irritated her nerves, making her
peevish and unhappy when she had no idea, nor he
neither, the cause of her condition. So much for the
Pantarchican.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Jan. 25&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.&mdash;</span>In reply to yours of recent date, will say in
answer to your first question that I have never heard of a
similar case to the one you relate. I admit it might be possible,
but I am not well enough acquainted with the mysterious
to attempt any explanation.</p>

<p>Second: If the wife did not suspect any infidelity on
the part of the husband, I cannot conceive that it would affect
her in the least, no matter how promiscuous he might
be in his relations with other women.</p>

<p>Intercourse with a woman who does not enjoy the act,
but merely submits passively is always followed by mutual
depression and disgust. Impotence to man and woman is
often caused by sex relations of this character.</p>

<p>3d. My impression is that variety as practiced by so-called
free-lovers is demoralizing, subversive of true love
and certainly lessens the respect that man ought to have
for woman. Varietists of both sexes are people with abnormal
sexual appetites who have it on the brain, and
whose only ambition in life is to gratify the sex nature.
They are gluttons whose passion grows on what it feeds.</p>

<p>4th. A woman who has intercourse with two men,
being married to one, is a prostitute pure and simple. Her
demoralization is as complete as though it were with a
dozen. Love cannot exist under such a beastly arrangement.
Variety is demoralizing to both sexes and ought not
exist.</p>

<p class="right">Yours,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Dr. H. Hague</span>,</p>

</div>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>The Doctor evidently does not recognize the power
of unseen forces&mdash;or what is termed the occult, as
affecting every day life.</p>

<p>If a woman is almost or quite material in her
development and has no outward sign of her husband's
outside relations, or if she does not care for
him, feeling as I once heard a very heartless woman
express herself: "It is like the washing, the more of
it that is put out the less I have of it to do," such
women will not be affected by what they do not see
or know of, but fine sensitive, womanly women who
love their husbands must feel such things though not
understanding the cause of their disturbed condition.
So it seems to me.</p>

<p>And as investigators, is it best to pass too severe
judgment upon persons; can we get the truth by so
doing? There are good men and good women who
from various causes have been led in to the "select variety"
of sex life. That it is not the highest, best
form I am well satisfied, but people will not be driven
out of it. They must be convinced that there is a
better; there must be good, substantial reasons given,
and then time to re-adjust their lives to the true order.</p>

<p>Suppose a woman is married to a man who has
become distasteful to her but for the sake of peace
and her children she continues to submit to his claims,
and yet at the same time loves another man and sexualizes
with him also, which relation is it that makes
her a prostitute, the legal or the illegal one? As I
see things it is the legal one, and that the unwilling
relation makes her equally so whether she associates
with the man she loves or not.</p>

<!-- page 103 -->

<p>But the case I gave the Doctor is not quite like
the above supposition. It was that of a woman who
scouts the idea of loving any man well enough to be
unhappy without him, and who is ready to caress
two men in one house when away from her legal mate,
and to do this wherever her fancy leads, and though
calling herself reformer, I am not surprised that the
Doctor says prostitute. The next two letters are
from members of the Social Science League.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Feb. 5&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Waisbrooker</span>,</p>

<p>Dear Madam:&mdash;Your favor at hand and I hasten to reply.
In answer to the first question, I know of no such
case as you cite. I know this, however. Couples who live
together and the man visits outside, as a rule, do not live
happily together. This also is true of the woman. There
are many cases where one or both, when separated for
weeks or months, could have sexual connection outside and
be greatly benefitted, but when a couple are living together
they should be so well pleased with the union that outside
connections could not be thought of; otherwise I believe a
separation would be advisable.</p>

<p>I sometimes think, however, and have the testimony
of two persons in proof of it, that in some cases where man
and wife have lived together continually for several years
and sexual estrangement is the result, that both may be
greatly benefitted, and even restored to each other by outside
connections. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; has admitted this to be true
in her case; says it saved a separation, and that she and her
husband are now living happily together.</p>

<p>My wife is almost dormant sexually, and has always
been so. I have urged her to have outside association to
see if it would not be beneficial, but she scouts the idea.
I have always found it to be true that when sexual commerce
is not satisfactory husband and wife do not live happily

<!-- page 104 -->

together, and one or both are almost certain to seek
outside association. Under such circumstances we [the
League] favor variety or separation.</p>

<p>For the past month I have been living a continent life,
my wife being in the country. I have been practicing Dianism
and do you know I am almost a sick man. My appetite
is poor, am nervous and my mind is almost continually
running upon things it ought not to be. In fact, I
am almost as near hell as I care to get. I am more than
disgusted with such nonsense. In fact I believe and know
that I could not live such a life without actually undermining
my health, and I believe the same would be true of
my wife as her health is better when we are together.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; once wrote me confidently that she
was a physical wreck and expected to die any day but that
sexual connection with strong men brought her back to
health.* I have known other cases similar. I guess I
have not exactly answered your questions, but my sheet is
full. I wish you success. My wife and I are anxious to
meet you.</p>

<p class="right">S. S. L.</p>

<p>[*Over the signature of Goldena, I have given the statement
of the lady to whom he refers.</p>

</div>

<p>For the benefit of such as do not understand the
meaning of Dianism I will say it is a system of nude
contact to exchange sex magnetism without waste;
or, as Rachel Campbell would say, to exchange the
life-force, the spirit of sex and preserve the husk. As
to the cases named, one cannot judge from the mere
facts; the causes which led thereto must be understood.
In desperate conditions of physical health
physicians often give, to restore the lost balance, that
which if taken in health would make one sick.</p>

<p>In our investigations, temporary results, permanent
results, best results all come in as a part of the
discussion, and if the truth leads to universal mixture

<!-- page 105 -->

the honest seeker will follow. Dr. Taber's remark
about the attitude of the mind, as expressed in his
second letter, has much significance. If we favor or
oppose a given course such feeling will inevitably affect
the result.</p>

<p>I am no more in favor of Dianism than Social
Science League is. Such disgust as he expresses is
but the natural outcome of an unnatural method;
still, it is barely possible, had he been prepossessed
in its favor, that the result would have been different.
A gentleman who was a varietist who was loved by
one who did not believe in variety, once said to her
after an absence of several weeks:</p>

<p>"I sexualized with no one while I was gone out
of respect to your feelings, but I Dianized with one
woman." "Oh," said she, in speaking of it afterward,
"it disgusted me; I would as soon he had
held the natural relation," and that is as I should feel
under the same circumstances. Another League correspondent writes:</p>

<p>"It is the strangest thing that men are so bent on
carrying out their ideas of variety that if there is a
woman who is on that plane they will go miles to meet
her, and some women think they are doing a big thing
if they can make many conquests, but when it is all
done it is ever unrest, ever craving and unsatisfied.
It does not bring any permanent good, no peaceful,
restful state of mind, but such is life with the great
majority."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The lady who wrote the above has had much experience
with that phase of life and knows what she is
talking of.</p>

<!-- page 106 -->

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister:&mdash;</span>Your communication under the head
of "wanted" is before me. Your subject is the greatest
and most important of any that can be discussed.</p>

<p>The experiences you speak of are natural and quite
common. After two souls have been united for a time it
is natural that practical "variety" enjoyed (?) by either
should affect the other though they are many miles apart.
My first wife told me before I married her that if she could
have children without being married she never would marry.
After she ceased to bear children she had no further
use for a man.</p>

<p>I married again, but as soon as I did so she became
partially insane. Once she was in a cemetery and among
many strangers, when some one bantered her upon her
situation. She threw herself upon the grass and screamed:
"I am his wife as much as I ever was and he is my husband,"
this she yelled again and again. She had thought
she had no further use for a man but nature was too strong
for her. She was partially insane for several years but her
children clung to her, and at the change of life she entirely
recovered. I know of many similar cases:</p>

<p>At Berlin Heights the reformers (?) had all the "liberty"
they desired. I could mention many instances of the
effects of mixed sex relations like the following: Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
found her "affinity" and enjoyed herself till her legal husband
found his, then she was in misery. I believe that all
women suffer more or less under similar circumstances,
though but few ever mention it. Jealousy did its work.
They experimented and suffered. From amid broken
hearts, crushed hopes and lacerated affections, they cried out
in vain. Of the crowd there in '59 only three now believe
in "mixed relations."</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Berlin Heighter</span>.<br/>

Feb. 20&mdash;93.</p>

</div>

<p>I have never met the writer of the last letter
but I know something of his first wife, and it always
makes me sad to look at her. She seems to me like

<!-- page 107 -->

a magnificent but smothered glory. Could she have
had a man who understood her&mdash;one who would have
given her time to rest after her period of child bearing
till the awakening of her spiritual sex nature, what
a blessing she could have become to herself and others.
Alas, how little is known of the laws of life!</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This next letter I cannot bring myself to give in
full as written; it revolts me, and yet the fault may
be in me. I may not be free enough from educational
prejudices and hereditary tendencies to investigate
as I should. However, I will try to be just to the
writer, even if I do put part of what he says in my
own language.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">March&mdash;93.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend and Sister:&mdash;</span>Received your late book;
"A Sex Revolution." Enjoyed it very much. Have also
got the "Occult Forces of Sex." I enclose the price of
"Perfect Motherhood" and 10 cents extra to register. I
have been Wanamakered out of several books during the
past administration so I prefer to have them registered now.
Noticing your request through "Lucifer" for sexual experiences,
I will relate one.</p>

<p>I have a very dear lady friend who from reading the
teachings of the Egyptians (I believe) became convinced that
her delicate constitution and frail little body could be built
up by the method taught in said book. She selected me as
the man to help her. I was then 43 (now 45), strong, supple,
athletic; have never been sick, a fine type of the balanced
temperament; black hair, blue eyes, perfect teeth;
small boned but very muscular. The reproductive power
strong but well under control. For the last seven years am
leading a continent life, and am improving right along
physically, mentally, morally and spiritually.</p>

<p>The lady is, or was, a very frail, delicate little body, low

<!-- page 108 -->

in vitality, poor digestion and nutrition, very nervous. Our
experience was this: We went to a secluded spot in the
mountains in mid summer&mdash;[here follows a description of
methods to get the full benefit of the magnetism of a sun
bath, of the earth magnetism, the two blending with the
magnetism of sex in union without culmination&mdash;this from
one to two hours at a time.]</p>

<p>We kept this up every day for two weeks at the end of
which she had gained several pounds in weight and had improved
in every way wonderfully, so that without any more
experiences of that kind she went right on improving until
she has become a perfectly healthy woman. The experience
gave her so much confidence in my honor, and my ability to
remain continent under such circumstances, that she turned
her daughter of 16 over to me for the same treatment, she
being a very puny, undeveloped girl.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>When we reached home the fourth day a remark the
mother made caused me to notice what I had not seen before,
a decided improvement in the girl's expression. We
kept up the treatment for two weeks and she improved exactly
as her mother had, and kept on improving, and is now
as plump and healthy a girl as you would wish to see. I
have slept with them in a perfectly nude condition [Dianized]
several times the last two years but have not connected
sexually since our "treatment" in the mountains, as
the mother does not approve of that unless it is necessary
as a "treatment," as she calls it.</p>

<p>The mother's idea gained from the book referred to is
that they gathered the magnetism of mother earth through
me by the way of the sex organs. Some Christian Science
ladies to whom I related the experience say their restoration
to health was due solely to their belief&mdash;that the treatment,
so-called, had nothing whatever to do with it. A Hindu
friend of mine says it was due solely to the action of the
sun and air.</p>

<p>I myself, were it not for the improvement that took

<!-- page 109 -->

place in the little girl as soon as I succeeded in forming full
connection (the 4th day) would say that sex connection had
nothing to do with their restoration to health. Now I do
not know as this will interest you but I should like to have
your opinion upon it. I am a convert to the Esoteric teaching
and am now living the regenerate life.</p>

<p>Hoping that this letter may be of some interest to you,
I remain,</p>

<p class="right">Your fraternally,<br/>

</div>

<p>I did not give an opinion, but wrote to find
where I could obtain the book referred to, and received
the following reply. I have not written him
since. There is something about the whole matter
so repellent to me that only the importance of the
question under consideration prevented me from putting
the first letter in the stove without a second
reading. I have tried to reason with myself, have
said: The health of that daughter was of too much
account to have the mother shrink because of a fastidious
feeling against having the same man treat her
daughter who had treated herself, for it was simply
magnetic treatment no matter what the method, yet
I could not have done so.</p>

<p>Then I continue:&mdash;Well, if I feel thus upon a subject
that I know to be of so much importance, what
can be expected of those who do not see how much
depends upon a correct knowledge of sex law.</p>

<p>The method of treatment proposed by the lady
and acceded to by her friend, was simply the "Male
Continence" advocated at the Oneida Community in
New York when Mr. Noyes was living. However,
I will make no more excuses for my feelings in this

<!-- page 110 -->

matter, but refer my readers to the letter and leave
them to consider the facts there stated.</p>

<p>One thing is certain. People will search after
knowledge in this direction, and far less evil will come
from open investigation than from suppression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam:&mdash;</span>Yours of the 25th ult. asking where
you could get the book on the "teaching of the Egyptians"
referred to in the letter I wrote you about a month ago
detailing my experience with a lady and her daughter, was

in reply to one I wrote her on receipt of yours. She hasn't
got the book or does not know that there is any book on
the subject, but is under the impression that it is taught in
some mystic order. She got the information from a Gypsy
woman (fortune teller) who claimed that the "treatment"
was in vogue among the Egyptians in the days of the Pharaohs.
I have another subject who desires the "treatment"

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This finishes what letters I think best to give.
There are many points on which I should like to
speak more fully but am at a loss just how to express
just what I feel. I note, however, an almost entire
absence of any recognition of the spiritual in sex.
Some of the writers seem to advocate methods which

<!-- page 111 -->

not only tend to restore lost power but to increase the
original capital. Doctors Taber and Dade both
speak of increased pleasure through variety.</p>

<p>As I see things, this is a result to be feared. It
seems to me analogous to stimulating trees to fruit
bearing till, overtaxed, they cease bearing at all.
Do not both men and women become impotent from
this cause after a time. I am told that impotence is
a torture to men, and if it comes from over-wrought
action it seems to me it must be.</p>

<p>Others of the writers seem to have spiritual aspiration
but think that to become spiritual they must get
"above sex," grow away from it&mdash;this instead of so
permeating the sex life with spirit as to satisfy, and
thus take away all abnormal craving. In other words,
permitting the spiritual to descend into sex and thus
quenching the "raging thirst" with which many are
tortured. The facts seem to those who give them,
strong evidence in favor of variety. I do not so see
them. They seem to me emergency measures to
meet and overcome evils which are the result of ignorance
and a false condition of society, justifiable, perhaps,
under the circumstances but not to be desired.</p>

<p>Desperate diseases demand desperate remedies,
but who would think of advocating such remedies as
our normal food. When sex law is fully understood&mdash;when
institutions are adapted to Humanity instead
of as now the vain effort to adapt Humanity to institutions,
I feel quite certain that there will be no cases
that even seem to demand such remedies as are
brought to light in those letters and in the personal
experiences to follow.</p>

<!-- page 112 -->

<p>I will give one experience right here as an illustration
of what I mean by emergency measures. A
lady who had always had a great deal of trouble with
one of her children, said to a friend in my hearing:</p>

<p class="small">"I do not know what you will think of such a confession,
but at the time of his conception I did not want my
husband but the hired man. I should have believed myself
eternally lost had I yielded to that feeling, but had I known
what I do now, I should have given my child a different
father. I never was very deeply in love with my husband
and a few years of life with him had made him almost,
sometimes quite repulsive, and it has always seemed to me
that this child had an involuntary controversy with me, a
sort of spite for giving him the father I did."</p>

<p>Now suppose that at the time spoken of that
mother could have foreseen the result of fathering
another child by her husband, and also what the result
would be should she accept the hired man, and
had, in spite of her scruples, chosen the latter alternative,
that would have been an emergency measure.
The reader will perhaps say that my claim for woman
involves the right of a woman to her choice.</p>

<p>Yes, but my demand calls for entirely different
conditions from what we have to-day. Such freedom
for woman as will bless the race will tolerate no such
secrecy as deprives the child of understanding who
its father is. Under the freedom I demand the element
of dissimulation will not, per force of circumstances,
be gestated into the very fibre of the child's
being.</p>

<p>But enough of this now. The next chapter will
reveal some strange things.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">EXPERIENCES.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">THE CALIFORNIA MEDIUM.</p>

</div>

<p>During the winter of &mdash;76 I stayed some weeks
at Land's hotel in Sacramento, California, and while
there a woman from somewhere up in the mountains
came to the city on business and stopped several days
at the same place. I got somewhat acquainted with
her and she told me some strange things. She had
become clairvoyant and clairaudient, could both see
those who are called dead and hear them talk, and she
said they were continually begging for sexual intercourse.
I should have judged her insane on the sex
question had I not known of different mediums who
had made a similar claim.</p>

<p>She said she had been a Methodist, and some of
those who thus beset her were her old class-leaders
and class-mates, that the most filthy, obscene language
she ever heard, they used. They seemed to have an
idea that by some sex law they could, break through,
(they called it) into matter again. She said they
would scream, and curse, and swear they would break
through, till their strength seemed exhausted. Their
voices would grow fainter and fainter, till finally there
was silence and she would have peace for a time.</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>This woman's statement made the greater impression
upon my mind from the fact that I had read
a short time before in one of Mrs. Woodhull's lectures
that spiritualized sex aura was the element used
in materialization, and it seemed to me that the spirits
haunting this woman had gotten hold of the same
idea, or a crude reflection of it, perhaps from the woman's
brain, she having read the same thing I had.</p>

<p>But those spirits, having been taught that sex is
only of the flesh, and that they must crucify the flesh,
had of course very low ideas in connection with it,
consequently could only use the language of the street
or the brothel in their ignorant efforts to act upon the
new idea. Will the reader compare what Goldena
says with this woman's experiences and with Mrs..
Woodhull's statement. It looks as though a sex element
was needed in the development of mediumship.
Indeed, I have heard intelligent spiritualists say the
same the past summer. They said it in connection
with the experience of a lady the development of
whose mediumship had come to a standstill, but when
she married her power increased remarkably.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">THE QUEER DOCTOR.</p>

</div>

<p>In "The Fountain of Life" a queer doctor is spoken
of. That peculiar man, a healer who is mostly
supported in his old age by those he has benefitted,
once said on receiving a letter containing a ten dollar
bill: "See what I get for raping a woman." On being
questioned as to what he meant by such a remark
as that, he said:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>When wife and I were in &mdash;&mdash; we had a patient who
was bed-ridden. Her husband was in the oil business; lived

<!-- page 115 -->

in the sphere of oil&mdash;was completely saturated with the
spirit of oil, and in his association with his wife he had so
permeated her with the same element that she was helpless.</p>

<p>Once while treating her I was controlled to do so sexually.
She fought me but my wife, who understood what it meant,
held her. She was very indignant but we explained why it
was done, and finally she agreed to wait the result before
making any complaint about the matter. She got well, and
learning how to take care of herself, she has remained well.
She has sent me as high as $50 at a time.</p>

</div>

<p>I have given the Doctor's statement in his own
words as nearly as I can remember them. That he
was controlled I do not doubt, for in the first place,
a man in his senses would hardly have risked prison
so recklessly, or perhaps lynching had the matter become
publicly known. Again, I never heard of the
man being called untruthful even by his enemies, and
yet again, I have had too much testimony in regard
to such matters from other mediums.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">CHILDREN THUS BEGOTTEN.</p>

</div>

<p>Some thirty-seven years ago I made the acquaintance
of a gentleman and his wife, both mediums, who
had a little boy about two years old. They both told
me that they were both under control when he was begotten.
Conscious, but controlled. I afterward became
very much attached to the lady; indeed, she
was for the time, my ideal woman, and though the
years have drifted us apart she still holds a warm
place in my heart.</p>

<p>Some two years after meeting these people I
stayed a few weeks with a lady who married the second
time under very peculiar circumstances. She
had two little girls seven and nine years of age at the

<!-- page 116 -->

time of her husband's death, and a large house on her
hands encumbered with debt. They were Universalists,
he a minister, and the house had been built
with the idea of establishing a school for young ladies.
The lady herself was a refined, high minded, sensitive
woman, and to have had scandal touch her and
hers would have been terrible to her.</p>

<p>A wave of spiritual excitement struck the place;
circles were held in the homes of her most intimate
friends and she was induced to join in the investigation.
She found that she was a writing medium, her
hand being used independently of her brain. She was
given the name of a man in Tennessee, a stranger,
and told to write to him, state her case and await the
result. She did so. The man came there, paid the
debt, secured the property to her, and then married
her. When I was there this man, legally the woman's
husband, was at her home, though they did not
lodge together and he stayed there but a small portion
of his time. They had one child, a boy three years
old and the story he told me was this:</p>

<p>"She has a companion in spirit life and so have I,
and we never intended to live together as man and
wife; never but the once have we had connection and
then <i>I was as much controlled as is the axe in the
hands of the woodman</i>."</p>

<p>"Why did you marry, if you did not intend to
live together?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It was done for her protection. Spirits kept
saying she was to bear another child and there were
so many strange things happening she became very
much alarmed lest something should occur to ruin
her good name, so she went under legal cover."</p>

<p>Such was the story told me by the man, while the

<!-- page 117 -->

woman sat by with her sewing, and making an occasional
remark, and the child playing about the room.
I had heard the story from others in part, but the explanation
then given made some things clear that I
had not before understood.</p>

<p>In those days I had more belief in what is called
the personal history of Jesus than I have now, and I
used to wonder if that was not the way that he was
begotten&mdash;if Mary and some priest in the temple were
not both thus controlled. With the ideas then held,
the most natural way of describing such an experience
would be to call it the overshadowing power of
the Highest. Mary's child was prophesied of, and so
was the child of the woman who married for protection,
but I notice that in the latter case the spirit, or
angel had to use a human body to do the work, and
why not in the former? But the reader will be asking:
"What of those boys, are they making a mark
in the world?"</p>

<p>I have entirely lost track of them; do not even
know that they live.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">A STRANGE SICKNESS.</p>

</div>

<p>About fifteen years ago I met with an interesting
couple who seemed much attached to each other, but
at times the man would be attacked with a peculiar
kind of sickness in which he seemed all nerves, his
head so sensitive that he had to have it entirely covered
to keep the air from striking it, entirely unable
to labor, and tortured with abnormal sex desire.</p>

<p>He and his wife were intelligent above the average
and were both much interested in the sex problem,
so talked freely with me on the subject. He said: "If

<!-- page 118 -->

people knew the real condition (he was sick then) they
would say that excess in that direction had caused it,
but the fact is I am not so troubled when I am well."
They were in correspondence with a medium, a lady
much older than themselves of whom they often
spoke, and I said to them, you seem to think a great
deal of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The wife replied: "We ought to; she saved
Mark's life;" then in answer to my look of inquiry she
continued: "he had been sick a long time and we did
not expect he could live but a few weeks at best.
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, came and treated him; one day she was
controlled to meet him sexually. She cried about it,
said I would despise her, etc. Why should I despise
you for blessing him, I said, I do not expect to have
him long and I am glad of anything that can give
him any pleasure, but from then on he grew better,
and for a long time he was well, I wish she was
here now."</p>

<p>I said no more but did some thinking. But why
give such things to the public, is the question asked,
it is well enough for thinkers to know, but the masses
are so likely to make bad use thereof.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Mother, may I go out to swim?
Oh yes, my darling daughter,
Hang your clothes on a hickory limb
But don't go near the water.</p>

</div>

<p>The masses have been kept away from the water
long enough; it is high time they learned to swim;
they must learn to think or continue to be slaves
and why fear giving them something to think about?
But I must not forget to say that so far from being

<!-- page 119 -->

sensually organized, I never met a man who seemed
more clean and pure in thought. He was more finely
organized than his wife, and I have sometimes wondered
if that had anything to do with his sickness.</p>

<p>A minister whose orthodox cloak is getting so
thin that the light penetrates it, says there is no morality,
there is no religion, it is science. That is what
we want, the science of sex, the science of human
needs, the science of nature's law, and whatever conflicts
with these is immoral, is irreligious.</p>

<p>But before leaving this question of spirit control
connected with sex I will go back nearly thirty years
to a little village in the state of New York where I
spent the Sabbath and spoke in the old Universalist
church. Where I was entertained the man was a successful
healer, had performed some remarkable cures;
he was unconscious while treating his patients, and he
told me, his wife being present, that on one occasion
he used sex magnetism and never should have known
what had happened had he not been told.</p>

<p>Coming nearer to the present time, there is a lady
in an eastern city who within the last four years has
type-written and sent out a few copies of a pamphlet
on the subject of sex. She says that not being married
she is not supposed to know anything about this
question, but that she has a spirit husband who comes
to her when she does not violate the law that makes
it possible for him to come; no, the lady is not insane,
for I often see her name in connection with the active
workers in the field of reform.</p>

<p>This last case reminds me of a story told in the
old Testament Apocrypha, which could usually be

<!-- page 120 -->

found in the large bible when I was young. A certain
man had a daughter who had a familiar spirit,
evil spirit, I think the book says, and when he gave
her to some man as wife, when they went to the nuptial
bed this spirit would kill him. Finally the spirit's
power was broken and the girl could have a human
husband. I hardly think there would be any such
trouble in this modern case, for the lady would not
be given away by her father; she would make her
own choice and the spirit would have to abide by it.</p>

<p>But a word more about our healers. No, they
are not "a lecherous class." The magnetism thrown
off through their hands in their treatments tends to
lessen, not increase passion, and those I have talked
with say they prefer the mind free from everything
of the kind. It is only when the condition of the patient
demands it and the healer very easily controlled
that, so far as I know, such cases of sex treatment
have occurred. But mediums are not the only ones
who understand the healing power of sex in some conditions
of weakness. I have been told of healers
being called into church families to treat frail, undeveloped
girls thus, the parents having confidence in
the man that he would not go beyond the magnetic
phase, and preferring this to the death of their child.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">HENRY WARD BEECHER.</p>

</div>

<p>Since commencing this chapter, a strange thing
has occurred. I had no thought of touching Beecher's
case, but kept feeling the presence of some one
who seemed to want to say something to me. I invited
a young lady friend, a medium but not for the
public, to spend the evening with me. We had a successful

<!-- page 121 -->

sitting, the medium seeing, and giving the
name of the only sister of Henry Ward's that I ever
saw, and as she was twenty years ago. I never met
her but the once, and in coming to me she would naturally
think of that time, and thus stir the subtle
ether in which clairvoyants see, in waves like as she
then was, as she would <i>live</i> in that time while thinking
of it. This is not miracle; it is "science."</p>

<p>I expressed my pleasure at meeting her again and
asked if there was any particular thing she wished to
say to me. She assured me of the great interest she
took in my work and said she wanted me to speak of
her brother Henry in connection with what I am now
writing. I have not heard of this lady's transition,
(Nov. 19&mdash;95) so do not know if she came in her astral
body or as a spirit freed from the mortal form.</p>

<p>Now, as before said, I had not once thought of
speaking of Mr. Beecher in connection with this work,
but his experience is really in line with it. I well remember
Mrs. Hooker telling me that her brother's
domestic life had been one long martyrdom. She did
not speak against Mrs. Beecher personally; each with
a suitable companion might have been happy, but a
dove would torture an eagle were they tied together.</p>

<p>I do not know as I can make my meaning clear
as to the cause which led to the great social storm
called "The Beecher scandal" but I will try.</p>

<p>In 1874 the writer of this declared sex, as the
fountain of all life, to be also the fountain of all power.
This declaration was published, not only in the
paper then being issued from Battle Creek, Mich. but
1500 pamphlets of the same matter were sent out. In

<!-- page 122 -->

1888, 1000 copies of another pamphlet were issued in
which sex was declared to be re-generative as well as
generative. It was averred that our young people
should be taught that children are but the first fruits
of sex use&mdash;that it is a refiner, a regenerator <i>if we</i>
recognize the spiritual in the blending which thrills
soul as well as body when soul is permitted to take
part in the creative act.</p>

<p>The two pamphlets named are, with another, embodied
in "The Occult Forces of Sex." I give these
details, first, because it is pleasant to go back and
trace the growth from then till now; next because the
first steps of a great movement are not personal, but
public property; and lastly, because they, with what
Mrs. Woodhull and others said and did, show the condition
of the mental atmosphere at the time, Beecher's
experience being but a thunder clap presaging
the storm which will drive mere legality out of sight
in making way for the higher love life that is coming.
Those were seed time days, and the lines,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">The world has felt a quickening breath
From heaven's eternal shore,</p>

</div>

<p>is only another way of saying that the vibrations now
coming to us from higher planes are intense with creative
power, that the world is being impregnated
with a higher life. Yes, that was seed time, and the
green blades now begin to appear. Many are accepting
the thought that the creative power of men and
women is evolving to a higher plane where sex intercourse
will be more of brain and soul than of the
body, and a few are beginning to see what the writer
has all along maintained, that to be a soul and brain

<!-- page 123 -->

association the bodily organs need not be left out.</p>

<p>The thought directs the use, kindling brain and
soul into action, thus making the act whole&mdash;holy.</p>

<p>No sanction of church or state can make such an
act more pure nor the lack of such sanction less so.</p>

<p>For nearly or quite half a century this truth has
found lodgment in the brain of here and there a thinker,
and Beecher stood where investigation became a
necessity. He could not live on husks and give his
people bread, and he must justify himself to himself
which he could not do if he accepted law without love
as his standard of right. He saw that legality had
no right to come between mated, growing souls. He
took that which was his by nature's law and said of
her who had been a ministering life: "She is innocent
of the great transgression."</p>

<p>He did not feel it transgression only when the
old bore in upon him till he could not rise above its
questionings. The world interpreted from the old
standard, he from the new. He knew that legality
could not touch the soul life no matter how much it
might assume. Had the church, had public opinion
left Beecher to manage his own private matters he
could have remedied his mistaken choice years before.
That was the wrong association, not the one the
world condemned.</p>

<p>Oh, for the hammer of Thor to break in pieces
the chains which legality has put upon growing souls!</p>

<p>Oh, that Beecher had been true to the light he
saw! Weighed, and found wanting! Woman must
do this work.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">EXPERIENCES CONTINUED.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">A WOMAN'S CONFIDENCE.</p>

</div>

<p>For some reason, people give me their confidence,
tell me their experiences when I am least expecting it.
Some years since a middle aged lady called at the office
where I was working. I think she was canvassing
for books at the time. We had some conversation
and I found her quite radical in her ideas. In a
few days she called again and I chanced to be alone.
She then gave me facts in her history of which the
public did not even dream. She said:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>I have a good, kind husband considerably older than
myself. We have got along very well, lived in a quiet way,
no very great enjoyment and no particular trouble, but as I
approached the change of life my health began to fail and I
felt a longing for something, I knew not what. One day I
saw in the post office a man I felt I would give almost anything
to even touch. I saw him occasionally afterward and
always with the same feeling, and even stronger. It grew
upon me till at last I took pains to learn who he was and
finding he had no family, I sent for him. At first he seemed
repulsed, but when he knew me better that changed to attraction,
love, and I grew well and strong. My husband
knew it, and my married daughter knew it. I did not attempt
to hide anything from them, and my restored health
was evidence that it was right.</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>Do you continue to cohabit with your husband? I asked.
Oh yes, my husband is satisfied with me, and that man had
planned to go away before I met him. He remained for
awhile on my account but his business was such he finally
had to leave. My daughter lives near where he is now and
I intended to visit her before this, then I should see him,
but it is a long journey and I haven't been able to get away
and I am getting so I do not care so much as I did.</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly four years afterward I met this lady again.
She called in company with another lady who was having
some domestic trouble. She said to the other lady:
"You should tell Mrs. Waisbrooker everything for
you know she will make good use of it," but it was
herself that attracted my attention, she looked so
bright and happy. She seemed to have grown finer,
more spiritual. Indeed, I never saw such a change in
any one; her soul seemed to radiate light through her
features. I asked a question about the man she had
told me of, but in a way that she alone would know
who was intended but she evaded a reply. Presently
the other lady left, then she said:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>He has come back; he could not stay away, but I don't
want Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; to know that. She knows what I told you
when I saw you before but not who he is and she thinks
he is still on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Do you still live with your husband? I again asked.</p>

<p>No, only in the same house, and he is my protection.
He thinks it hard, but acknowledges my right to myself.</p>

</div>

<p>What was the law that governed in this case?
Why was she satisfied during the period of child bearing,
then dissatisfied and sick when she came to the
transition period, and why should another man, an
entire stranger, so attract her when at that age if, as

<!-- page 126 -->

some claim, sex is only for the propagation of the
race? I have quoted the following in another work,
but it is very appropriate here.</p>

<p>Mrs. Farnham, in her "Woman and her Era,"
says that at the transition period women divide into
three classes. In one class, when the periodical flow
ceases that element is transferred to the masculine
side of woman's nature, and she grows strong but
coarse. In another class it seems to be lost, woman
sinking down a helpless dependent. In the third,
a small but increasing class, this power rises into the
spiritual and woman grows beautifully old, finds her
last days her best, most useful days.</p>

<p>That woman as a sex, is passing into a higher
phase of life I cannot doubt, but this growth does
not come from obedience to our stereotyped morality,
but from the action of nature's law transferring
the materially creative element of sex into psychic or
soul life. As I read this woman's case, nature was
trying to transmute the monthly flow into psychic, or
soul growth but there was nothing in her husband's
nature to aid that effort, so she was sinking down
helpless; was sick and starved, for what she did not
know, but when she met the man who could supply
that need she was drawn to him as the starving are
to food. It was not because of a lascivious nature, but
a normal demand which she had a right to satisfy and
all the legal enactments in the world could not make
her act a wrong or impure one.</p>

<p>When there is a right understanding of this spiritual
law in sex, when the young are taught to look
beyond mere physical pleasure, then they will expect

<!-- page 127 -->

this awakening and prepare for it. This expectation
will call out in the man's nature that which is needed,
or if not, he will know that he can no longer hold the
woman he has called wife; and in a true state of society,
one which recognizes woman's right to herself,
he will not be needed in the home as her protection.</p>

<p>First the natural or material, then the spiritual,
and however much man may assume to lead in the
first he cannot in the last; he must follow woman's
lead, or they must part, or live in a death-in-life condition.
But it is not true of all women, perhaps of
but few, that the spiritual does not awake until the
transition period. With many it unfolds with the
first dawn of womanhood. It creates an ever-present
demand for soul love, but receives a new and higher
development at that period. In reference to wanting
she knew not what, the difference between that lady
and myself was that I did know, but it was first one
thing and then another, and whatever it was, could I
not get it I was sick. On the other hand, no matter
what it might be, even to brandy, nor how much I
might take when I felt that peculiar, insistent desire,
it never injured me, not even that which would have
made me sick at another time.</p>

<p>This feeling was Nature's call for what she needed
in her work, one of her "emergency measures,"
and as much so in that lady's case as in mine; the
fact of a different want does not change the principle.
But the "majesty of the law" must be sustained and
an arbitrary morality satisfied if half the race dies in
consequence. "The <span class="smcap">law</span>!" how busily its sustainers
are engaged in straining out the smallest gnats, and

<!-- page 128 -->

how triumphantly the camels continue to escape!</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">THE WIDOW'S EXPERIENCE.</p>

</div>

<p>That which follows was told by a lady who at the
time it occurred lived in an eastern city, but when she
related the story to me, was a practising physician
in the far west. I had known her in the east and
was glad to meet her again. We had both done some
thinking in the time and had much to say to each other.
Of what she told me during the little time we
were together, but one thing made any particular impression.
She said:</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Lois,</span> there is more to this sex question than most people
suppose, but if we dared to tell what we know they
would ostracise and starve us out. I had friend in the east
who was a widow. Her husband had been a man of strong
passions, but now she was alone. She lived in one of the
suburbs and had to cross the river to reach the city. One
day she came to me looking terribly distressed, and told
me that as she was coming over the bridge she was seized
with an intense sex desire, so much so that it was absolute
torture and she did not know what to do. That was before
I began to practice, and I supposed it a symptom of some
disease with which she was attacked, and went with her to
two or three physicians but all to no purpose. I became disgusted
with what seemed to me their ignorance, and finally
went to a medium near by. He seemed to understand and
said, leave her with me, I will take care of her; so I went
home and left her, knowing she must have relief in some
way. When she came to me the next morning she looked
like one glorified. I never saw such a change in so short
a time. She told me they sexualized three times; once for
the physical, once for the intellectual, and once for the spiritual.
I never heard of her having any more such trouble.</p>

<p>I wish I could put into words the idea that I get

<!-- page 129 -->

a glimpse of in this case, but there has been so little
thought in this direction that words seem to slip away
from me when I try, even to think clearly upon it; I
will say this, however: Looking upon that woman's
experience in the light of the philosophy of modern
Spiritualism, taking the ground that the death of the
body does not change the nature of the individual, is
it not possible it was the first time, after leaving his
body, that the man had come into rapport with his
wife, and in doing so had thrown his unsatisfied sex
want upon her, and in an intensified state.</p>

<p>[Right here, a word about the often used phrase,
"bodily appetites." The body has none. Appetite,
passion, are terms that signify want, desire, not of
the body, but of the life which, as far as is possible,
expresses the self-hood that uses the body. Sex is an
attribute of this self-hood, this indwelling I am, but
our ignorance has been such that only that element of
sex which is on a level with the flesh has been permitted
to permeate and find expression through it; and
thus the sex act has not been whole&mdash;holy, has been
called lust. Please remember then, that though expressed
through the body, the appetites and passions
are not of body; and let not those who indulge in the
flesh at the expense of the spirit flatter themselves
that all such desires will cease with the death of the
body for they will find themselves mistaken. We
will now return to our widow.]</p>

<p>Is it not further possible that the man while here
had regarded sex as purely of the flesh, and had thus
no idea of any way of help except through the flesh,
but when coming in contact with, and then using the
medium's body to connect with his wife, the intelligence
of that medium connected him also with the
spiritual in sex, and that from then on, he was able

<!-- page 130 -->

as a spirit, to gather what was needed to satisfy his
hungry spirit body, the soul, without making his wife
suffer or controlling another through whom to meet
her in the flesh? I do not say that this was so, for
I do not know, but from facts that have come to me
and hints, as it were, of thought gathered, I feel there
is a truth somewhere in this line that needs fathoming.</p>

<p>One of our best thinkers says of certain stages of
mental growth:</p>

<p>"He becomes a spiritual alchemist, and through
the alembic of the divinity awakened within him is
able to transmute the 'common and unclean' into the
pure, the ideal, the God-like."</p>

<p>It seems to me that some such law of life as this
writer expresses was brought into action in the case of
that widow. I once received a letter from a lady who
said she was pastor of a church in that city, and that
letter contained a hint of the same idea. She told me
of a girl who was in her home for awhile who had been
sent to her from a magdalene home. She said for a
time the girl seemed all right, then she began to be
restless, and soon it was found that she was meeting
men on the street and she had to be sent back to the
home. The Rev. lady (as nearly as I can remember
the words) then said she had sometimes wondered if
there were not men who could cure such girls of that
abnormal condition without risking parentage. I replied,
told her I thought I understood her idea, and
made some suggestions of a similar nature. I did not
hear from her again.</p>

<p>As to the effect of unseen influences, I know
something of that from personal experience. I am

<!-- page 131 -->

what is called a sympathetic medium; that is, I know
by the feeling thrown upon me, what the relation of
the unseen presence to the one they desire to reach.
I will cite a few cases: Once while lecturing I met a
gentleman who had lost his wife a few months before.
Had I not known from previous experience what the
feeling meant I should have believed that I had fallen
desperately in love with that man. As it was I had
to keep strict guard over myself to see that I made no
unwise move. Stopping at the same place, I was much
in his company the short time I remained. One day
while listening to his talk of his wife, I said: "Permit
me to tell you one thing your wife used to do,
when you were sitting or lying down, as she passed
you she would place her hand upon your forehead
run it up into your hair, and then kiss you."</p>

<p>"Yes, often, often," was his reply.</p>

<p>Soon after I had occasion to go into the next room
and he was lying on the sofa with his head near the
door. As I passed him I put my hand upon his forehead,
pushed it up into his hair, looked at him and
smiled. "Yes, that's just the motion," he said&mdash;no, I
did not kiss him, but it required will power to keep
from doing so even though I knew the feeling did not
originate with me, that when I left, which was the
next day, he would be no more to me than any other
stranger. Another case:</p>

<p>I once met a gentleman at a Convention, of whom
I had heard my friends speak but had never seen till
then. He too had lost his wife a short time before,
and I think he came with the hope of hearing from her
as he was not in the habit of attending those meetings.

<!-- page 132 -->

A circle was held and I was a little late; as I stepped
into the room this man's wife met me. I did not see,
but sensed her, and the conditions were such I consented
to her wishes. She took me to her husband,
seated me on the carpet at his feet, and laid my head,
on his knee. The man bent over till his head rested
on my shoulder and great, convulsive sobs shook his
whole frame. "Oh," said he, as soon as he could
speak "she has done that a thousand times."</p>

<p>I might relate much more, both of my own experience
and that of others' but it is not needed to show
that we are, or may become psychological subjects
for invisible intelligences, and if they can control mediums
for one thing they can for another if conditions
are right for it. I did not cultivate, but rather discouraged
in myself the phase of mediumship of which I
have spoken, and at last refused entirely to be so influenced,
because I found I was likely to be misunderstood
and thus grieve others, as well as being injured
myself. My final lesson was like this:</p>

<p>During my stay in one place I was much of the
time at a home where there was a second wife, a sweet
quiet little woman of deep feelings, and in my estimation,
superior to her husband who was a chatty, sociable
sort of man. I often felt the presence of his first
wife while talking with him. Before I left the neighborhood
the wife's health began to fail; had to call in
the doctor. What was my surprise upon meeting the
husband a year afterward, to be told that M's sickness
was caused by her fear that I was drawing his
affections from her, and he told me of some things I
did of which I had not the least recollection. It all

<!-- page 133 -->

came from that phase of sympathetic mediumship
which enabled his first wife to get near him, and he,
sensing her presence without realizing what it was,
made more response than he was aware of, and being
so much under that influence, I would not note it as
readily; but though a quarter of a century has passed,
I never think of that little woman, and the suffering I
thus unwittingly caused her, without a pang of regret.</p>

<p>Judging thus from personal experiences, my own
and others', the supposition I have made as to the
cause of that widow's sexual suffering at that particular
time, and the philosophy of her relief, are not so
far fetched as to be out of harmony with facts.</p>

<p>And just now there comes to my mind a story
told nearly forty years ago; one that I paid less attention
to then than I should to a reliable statement of the
kind now. A lady whose word I had no reason to
doubt, told me her deceased husband found a medium
he could make entirely unconscious, and through him
claimed the old relation: that she had yielded once or
twice, but feeling it was not using the medium right
she had refused to do so longer. Was she sure the
man was unconscious? She claimed she was sure.</p>

<p>But in the face of all these things, with the failure
of the ages behind us, with the fact of the astral body
going out thus, with partial materialization, with absolute
control, all defying legal power, the attempt to
measure sex morality by an arbitrary standard, then
trying to enforce it by law is the height of folly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Investigation</span> is what is needed.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had intended with the above remarks to close the
chapter, but there comes to me so vividly the memory

<!-- page 134 -->

of two experiences which so fully show that investigation
and education are indeed what we need, that
variety, select or otherwise, will yield to the light
which shows the way to the keeping of the dual relation
intact, I will give them here because of the lessons
they teach.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"INDEED I WOULD!"</p>

</div>

<p>A gentleman who was urging the benefits of variety,
told me his experience as follows.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>My wife's health failed, and I was without companionship,
unless I went outside, and I could not mingle with
public women. My health failed; my brain would not act;
I took to drinking, used tobacco freely, and was fast becoming
a complete wreck. I met an intelligent varietist, and
what she taught me has been my salvation. Association
with her so restored me that I stopped drinking, and from
another of that class I gathered the element that cured me
of wanting tobacco, and I am now well. My brain is clear
and my business a success.</p>

<p>I did not hide this from my wife, and it hurt her badly
at first, but she now acknowledges that I know better how
to treat her than I did and we get along nicely.</p>

</div>

<p>I listened till he said what he wished, then asked:
"If you had known at first what you do now, and had
so treated your wife that she had not failed you, and
the thought of another woman had never come between
you, would you not be happier now?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I should," was his quick response. There
spoke the soul of the man; that reply scattered his argument
for variety to the winds. I do not condemn
him for remedying the results of his ignorance as best
he could, but do urge open and full investigation,
and such instruction for the young, that such mistakes

<!-- page 135 -->

may not occur&mdash;that man may not destroy his life-blessing
by haste and excess. Earnest warning will not
deter the investigating mind from trying to look into
that which is hidden.</p>

<p>One of the most eloquent appeals to the young to
live pure lives that I ever read, was wholly lacking in
instruction and was more likely to excite curiosity than
to restrain those for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>The writer painted in vivid colors the terrible results
flowing from the violation of "God's holy law
of purity," and citing a case of a young man wasted
away with disease, till his bones turned to rottenness
because "once, only once" he had broken "God's holy
law of purity," and that he mourned because he had
"hated instruction." The trouble, doubtless was, the
poor fellow had not had <i>instruction;</i> he had only had
warning, and when temptation came in the guise of a
fascinating, but diseased woman, he readily fell into
the snare. "Once, only once." A youth of ordinary
intelligence would naturally ask why it was that Harry
Hart did not suffer thus when he seduced, and forsook
Maggie Jones, if one violation of the accepted
standard produces such terrible results?</p>

<p>Children feel that the whole truth has not been
told, that they are being deceived; they become not
only curious but defiant. Such one-sided statements
tend to create distrust of what is told them on
that subject; they investigate secretly, and under bad
influences, and thus society is cursed.</p>

<p>No, no, this is something that cannot be buried
from sight like a dead animal, no matter how repulsive
the details of its perversions may be; it is a living,

<!-- page 136 -->

an unquenchable fire, that as we deal with it, either
refines or consumes.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">MY EXPERIENCE.</p>

</div>

<p>Once it was told from the platform, and that the
women who heard me, some of them at least, will never
forgive me for owning to sex desire, I feel quite certain.
One fine looking woman said to me, if they
can't get above the sex question I shall stop coming
to these meetings. When asked how high they would
have to go to get above it, she didn't seem to know.</p>

<p>I met her again some six years after, and she had
a son with her, a witling some sixteen or seventeen
years old with the intelligence of a child of five. But
to that experience: I have survived more than twenty
years since the first telling, and think telling it again
will hurt no one else.</p>

<p>The social question was up. Beecher, Woodhull,
Tilton, were names upon every tongue. The frightened
ones would not permit us to examine and calmly
discuss; no, we must denounce or defend, and I lost
sight of myself, told the experience for the sake of the
lesson; and for that I tell it now.</p>

<p>I said that in my itinerating trips, speaking in
school houses, court houses, halls, anywhere I could
get a hearing, after awhile there come a feeling of exhaustion
and intense sex desire; that it came unsought
and would not be willed away. Continuing the experience
I said I attended a two day meeting with this
feeling, and being speaker and secretary had thrown
me into the society of gentlemen whose range of intelligence
made them companionable; when the meeting

<!-- page 137 -->

was over that sex feeling was all gone, and not a
move had been made that Mother Grundy could have
found fault with, had she been with me all the time.</p>

<p>It was a big lesson to me, and I thought it would
be to others. The why of the feeling with which I
had been tortured. My working force had all given
out and Nature was calling for more; if it could not
be gathered in a general way it must be manufactured
(sex being creative) or I must suffer for lack of vital
force. That experience taught me, when I found my
forces going, to, as far as was possible, so relate myself
to persons and conditions that I could gather what
was needed without shocking myself or anyone else.</p>

<p>Since then I have blamed ministers who stumble,
less, and pitied them more. If we could talk as freely
of creative hunger, of the conditions that aggravate or
quiet&mdash;as we can of stomach hunger, pitfalls might be
avoided, and lives happily balanced that now go to ruin.
And yet, it was a terrible thing! that telling of
my experience! Such is present judgment. The future
will reverse it. I can wait.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">TWO VARIETY HISTORIES.</p>

</div>

<p>The following letters give a glimpse of the "under cover"
working of society as it exists to-day. Occasionally,
years ago, I used to meet the writer, and
she was well spoken of. She certainly would not tell
me such things of herself if they were not true. As
to her friend's life, I see no reason why she should
mis-state or exaggerate, and the fact that she give
me her own name, while withholding that of her
friend, shows her sense of honor.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">October 16&mdash;94.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Waisbrooker</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Worker&mdash;</span>The contents of this letter will
doubtless, surprise you, but I have read your books, and
hearing of your arrest, I feel prompted to give you some
facts that may be of use to you; for, whatever the result of
the present move against you, I know that you will work
while life lasts. A friend writes me that you refused to
give the name of the man who wrote the letter for publishing
of which you have been arrested, and it gives me such
confidence in your honor that I am not afraid to give you my
name, for whatever you may think of me, I feel quite sure
you will not betray me.</p>

<p>It is not supposed by the great public that I have ever
violated the sex standard. I note what you say, however,

<!-- page 139 -->

in your "Fountain of Life" of the fascination to generous
natures of being unselfish even in sex matters, so it occurred
to me to tell you some things that I know which have a direct
bearing upon that idea.</p>

<p>Yes, you will be surprised, but you will learn on reading
this that I am human, in my weakness at least. I lived
till I was about thirty entirely alone so far as sex is concerned
with the exception of the few weeks of married life
that ended with the terrible railroad disaster in which the
only man I ever really loved was killed. People say I
have lived true to his memory; how little is known of what
is under cover, and yet, strange as it may seem, I have never
held that relation with another that I have not felt his
presence, but I must not tarry here.</p>

<p>I was not twenty when I was married and for ten, long,
lonely years I lived as true to the standard as woman could.
Sometimes I was very sex hungry but of course it must be
controlled and endured. This could be done when awake,
but in my sleep there would at times be involuntary action.
The culmination would generally awaken me, but not always.
When only partially awake it would seem the next
morning like a dream. After a time I made the acquaintance
of a man and his wife who were believers in what they
called free love. I listened to their arguments, my own
needs seconding their theories, till I was pretty well convinced
but not yet ready to act.</p>

<p>One night circumstance made it necessary for me to stay
at their home and soon after I retired the doctor came to my
room. I feebly repelled him and asked him what his wife
would think.</p>

<p>"Oh, she will not care."</p>

<p>"Well, I had rather her say so."</p>

<p>He went to the top of the stairs and called her, told her
I refused without first having her full consent, which she
promptly gave, and never did I receive an unkind word or
look because of it, though I was much in the family after
this. I loved her but soon recoiled from him, for he was

<!-- page 140 -->

quick tempered, and very unreasonable when angry. He
professed great love for his wife, but at such times was abusive;
in justice to his memory, however, I will say this: I
never heard a vulgar word nor a vulgar insinuation from
his lips on the subject of sex, neither did I ever see him exhibit
anything like jealousy when other gentlemen manifested
admiration for her, though I never knew of her taking
the same liberties that he did.</p>

<p>But I was not long in learning that this woman who
was so willing to share her husband with another, did not
love him. She said to me in telling her story: "I don't know
why I married him, and yet I do in part: he controlled me
and he holds me in the same way. I have hoped that he
would find some one he could love better and let me go; but
no, no matter who he is connected with, if he gets the idea I
have a thought of leaving he drops everything and clings to
me, says he cannot and will not live without me, so I stay."</p>

<p>I found before leaving that she was subject to more than
his will. One night after they had some words she slept
with me, and when partly asleep she began to murmur:</p>

<p>"Stick to Henry, yes, stick to Henry."</p>

<p>I asked what she meant; she roused up and did not
know what she had been saying. When I told her she remarked:
"Oh, that is Henry's mother; she often controls
me, and always begs that I stick to him, says he needs me,
and I suppose he does." This thought of his need held her,
making her forget herself; then she was told that he would
not live long. I have known nothing of them personally for
many years but I hear that he has recently passed over leaving
her a gray haired grandmother.</p>

<p>One more experience in what is called select variety.</p>

<p>The character of the doctor began to be questioned before
they left the place, but these people were always, and
altogether above suspicion. For three or four years while
teaching dress cutting, canvassing for books, etc., I was frequently
at their home and was kindly, lovingly received.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to mar the harmony till my last visit

<!-- page 141 -->

and it is of that I wish to tell you, as it seems to me to illustrate
your idea of the difference between mere physical attraction
and the deeper love for which woman's soul calls.</p>

<p>When I made that last visit I had been absent much
longer than usual and I found the lady in quite poor health.
She had fairly entered the transition period of woman's life,
was weak, nervous, and clung to him as I had never seen
her do before. She told him, as I learned afterward, that
she was entirely willing he should visit with me, exchange
magnetism, but requested him not to go farther. He did
not heed her request, and I did not know of it, so the usual
result followed. The next morning I saw that something
was wrong, and I soon learned what, for she was not slow
to repeat her grievance.</p>

<p>The point that hurt her was that he did not care enough
for her to heed her request at a time when she was so weak
and nervous. Her tears cut me to the heart, and I scolded
him roundly for not telling me but that did not seem to make
things any better. I never went there again. I incidentally
met him once afterward and he told that from then on she
seemed to hate me.</p>

<p>But I have made this quite too long now, so I will close
by saying that if this is acceptable and you desire me to do
so, I will send you the history of a friend who has battled
and triumphed, but shall not give her true name, as I have
mine.</p>

<p class="right">Fraternally,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Margaret Clinton</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>There is food for much thought in this history so
frankly given, in connection with the workings of variety.
The first thing I will notice is what Mrs. Clinton
says of never hearing sex vulgarity from the doctor.
When I read that I stopped to think; I went
over all that I have ever known of men who openly
advocated the freedom of the affections, and I could
not remember ever hearing a vulgar word or insinuation
connected with sex, from any one of them. I

<!-- page 142 -->

know I should have remembered if I had heard any
thing of the kind, for no one thing so completely disgusts
me with either man or woman.</p>

<p>As to his association with other women, I think
it was because he did not have his wife's love, could
not win from her that which satisfied, so he sought
elsewhere, but not to the extent of being willing to
give her up, and the selfish mother in spirit life helped
to hold her, being just as willing to sacrifice another
mother's daughter to her son as many a selfish mother
is here, in this life. But as I see things, when this
sex question is fully understood, no man or woman
can hold another as that woman was held.</p>

<p>As to the second case, it seems to me to prove
that when only the physical life is stirred, variety
does not trouble some natures; but when a deeper, a
higher, closer union is desired, when nature is working
to that end, then no third party is welcome. At
that period that woman needed all her husband's love
and devotion, and I think the very fact that the other
woman would have had more consideration for her
than he did had she known the wife's wish, only hurt
her the worse.</p>

<p>Yet another point: When Mrs. Clinton speaks of
always feeling her husband's presence when she held
the sex relation, it made me wonder how much vicarious
work is done, in that direction as well as others,
for those who have gone over. Surely, nature protests
loudly against people's dying, leaving the earth-body,
till their work is done&mdash;the soul so ripened
that it will have no need to return to gather through
others.</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<p>Life, better, more perfect life is what is called
for, and it can no where be found but in the right use
of the life-fountain, sex. Only in an understanding
of, and obedience to the law inhering in sex, all conditions
and institutions being adapted to the possibility
of such obedience.</p>

<p>Of course I replied to Mrs. Clinton's letter, and
she gave me her friend's history as follows:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">MAUD RAYMOND.</p>

<p>Maud Snow was a bright, intelligent girl, really the
flower of the family, for none of the others have made a
mark in the world. Harry, or Mr. Raymond, though much
older than herself, stood high in the society in which they
moved, and though not a man of means when Maud married
him it was thought she had done well. He chose her,
not only for her youth and beauty but because he discovered
that she possessed talent. He possessed a strong sex nature
and so did his young wife, but he had become infected
with what you call man's idea of freedom, variety, and he
taught the same to her.</p>

<p>I do not know so much of his friendships with her lovers
but I do know that she was friendly with women with
whom he associated. Just the result followed that might
have been expected. He became repulsive to her as a sex
mate. Finally she rebelled, refused to live with him. He
felt terribly about the matter, plead for continued love, but
it was gone and could not be called back, so he was forced
to submit. He died a few years after but she is still living
and an honored worker in the cause of humanity. The last
time I saw her I found she had gone to the other extreme,
believed in absorbing sex life in brain work. But to her
history after separating from her husband.</p>

<p>She had her lovers and they sometimes gave her financial
aid but she did not depend upon them. She had
been a teacher before her marriage and she now had prepared

<!-- page 144 -->

a course of lectures which she was giving with reasonable
success. The man of whom she rented the hall
lost his wife. If he had been other than an animal he
would have been a good looking man, but his sensuality
was so apparent it made him repulsive to any sensitive
woman.</p>

<p>This man's wife had been dead but about three weeks
when he came to Maud with proposals for sex association.
She got rid of him as easily as she could but came right to
me with her story. "Oh," she said, "I never felt so degraded
in my life." The man put on the air of a virtuous
protector of society's interests and refused to let her have
the hall any longer, giving out to the public as a reason that
he considered her teachings injurious.</p>

<p>This threw her out of her legitimate means of support
for there was no other hall that she could get without paying
more than she could afford. She sat down to think
she saw that it was only a question of time when she would
be pushed to the wall, prostitution her only means of support.
What should she do? She took her child by the hand
and tried to find work in people's kitchens but no one wanted
her with a child, and again came the question, what
should she do?</p>

<p>She was disgusted with marriage. She demanded the
right to live in loving, or at least mutual relations without
being owned, but this society refused. No one of her lovers
was in a position to support her and she was tired of
variety. She soon after met a noble man who would have
married her but to this she would not consent. She believed
she had the right to herself and she accepted him
without marriage. A few of her friends knew this but the
great public did not.</p>

<p>He cared for her and hers, gave her advantages that
made her splendid talents available and was as careful of
her good name as if he had been her brother. In time she
took her place before the world, educated, talented, attractive,
and that world has never questioned. After a time

<!-- page 145 -->

circumstances separated this couple. What the circumstances
were I do not know for when the separation occurred
I was upon one side of the continent and she upon
the other and I have never solicited her confidence.</p>

<p>But I often think, if the world knew, what a row there
would be. Still, what has she done that should crush her;
true, she violated legal morality, but the only real prostitution
she ever knew was when she submitted to her husband
after he became repulsive to her. She was too true,
however, to continue a prostitute because the law said she
might. She refused to continue to bear children to the
man the law said she had a right to bear them to&mdash;she
broke the bond&mdash;forced her way upward instead of being
forced downward. True, she was obliged to do so surreptitiously,
but she lived the right to her own person, and no
woman is free without that right, and she conquered fate.</p>

</div>

<p>I may be mistaken, but I think I know who Mrs.
Clinton's friend is, and if I am right, hers has indeed
been a triumph.</p>

<p>The only drawback in my mind is that society is
so cruel, so false, so unjust she cannot show others
the path in which she has walked, the difficulties she
has overcome without destroying herself. Could she
do this, could she point to the abyss from whence she
has climbed, could she uncover the path by which
she made her way upward and say: Courage, my
struggling sisters, then the fullness of the blessing of
her triumph could shine out, but now it can do so only
in part.</p>

<p>These letters, this confidence was a surprise, but
not more so than many things I have been learning
for the last twenty years. One thought strikes me
when reading Mrs. C.'s account of her friend's course,
and it is this: It will be asked why that friend could

<!-- page 146 -->

not live with her husband without children as well as
with another man. There are two reasons why.</p>

<p>The first is, husbands as a rule, do not care what
the results are so they are fully gratified. The other
is, conception, the mere material phase which makes
the child a child of lust, is more likely to take place
when the woman does not respond than when she
does. This, if nothing else should forever protect
woman from an unwelcome embrace.</p>

<p>Further correspondence with Mrs. C. shows that
she has profited by her experiences and is thinking
deeply, and here I will make an extract from another
letter in which she argues the question of conscience
in connection with the violation of the legal sex code.
She says:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>It has been thought that a woman who deliberately
violates the accepted standard of sex morality must be utterly
destitute of conscience, or any sense of right. It was
once so thought of those who dared to question the inspiration
of the bible, the sanctity of the Sabbath, etc., but
observation demonstrates that as a class those who thus
question are as moral, often more so than are professed
Christians, and to my mind the man or woman who does
right for the sake of the right is far above those who obey
standards without examination because believed to be right.</p>

<p>When the character of woman is considered by society
it seems to me that all that is recognized as worth
anything is her sex. If she follows the code in that she
has a good character, is a virtuous woman, but if she fails
here she is characterless&mdash;is entirely ruined. An unselfish
nature, a kind heart, integrity, truthfulness&mdash;all these
count for nothing if she holds not her sex as owned&mdash;as the
property of the state till said owner, or she herself finds
one who will promise to take care of her for its use.</p>

<p>Oh, the degradation!</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>On the other hand, a woman may be a perfect virago;
a tattler, quarrelsome, untruthful, selfish, etc., but if she
conforms to the sex code she is a virtuous woman. I do
not wonder that men prefer the company of the former
class who are not counted virtuous to that of the latter
who are. Now the question that I want to see answered
is: "Can a woman use her sex contrary to law for a good
purpose, can she be virtuous in so doing, really virtuous
and not as the world counts virtuous?"</p>

<p>I am asking this question in reference to things as
they now are, not in reference to that ideal state of society
which actualized, there will be no need of asking such a
question. You know you make Helen Harlow say in reply
to her mother's statement that we must take things as they
are: "And make them what they should be, or at least try
to do so, and that is what I want&mdash;to try to make things as
they should be."</p>

</div>

<p>In reply to the above question I unhesitatingly
say: Yes, she can, if she is strong enough, virtuous
enough to do so. In binding woman as he has, man
has taken from her the very power that nature gave
her for good. How many men would live low, degraded
lives if they could know that by so doing
they deprived themselves of all hope of woman's love?</p>

<p>The demand here made for woman's entire freedom
will give her the power to always use her sex
conscientiously and for the betterment of Humanity.
Now the only conscience she can have in the matter is
the educated one that she must submit to her husband&mdash;that
she owes him wifely duty.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">ANOTHER HISTORY.</p>

</div>

<p>Several years since I met at one of the many
camp meetings I have attended, a gentleman and lady
whom I will call Mr. and Mrs. Caldern. The lady
had a little girl about two years old, a bright, winsome
little thing. They purchased copies of such of
my books as I had with me, and soon after a younger,
an unmarried man came up to whom I was introduced
as Mr. Burns. He commenced looking over
my books when Mrs. Caldern remarked:</p>

<p>"You don't need to buy those books, George,
for we have just bought them."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen were very friendly. They
were traveling and had taken in the camp on their
route. Somehow, by one of those instincts or intuitions
by which we know things without external
evidence, I felt that the little girl belonged to the
younger man. Still I refused to accept what I felt,
and finding that Burns had been a member of the family
for several years, I decided that the resemblance
between the two was the result of a sort of psychic
impression having been made upon the mother, she
had transmitted the same to her child. I was the

<!-- page 149 -->

more inclined to this view from what I had heard a
gentleman say some years before, of the difference
between his eldest daughter and the other children:</p>

<p class="small">She is like the elder who was on our circuit the year
she was born (they were Methodist and he himself was a
minister at the time of his marriage) but I know she does
not belong to him for wife was three months along the first
time she saw him, but after that he was often at our house
and Mary not only looks but acts like him.</p>

<p>It was thus I reasoned in connection with Mrs.
Caldern and her child, still I could not wholly rid
myself of the first impression. About a year afterward
I learned through a friend that Caldern and his
wife had separated, Caldern going away and Burns
remaining with the family which consisted of an older
daughter and a son. The only reason given for this
was that they, a company of them, were going into a
co-operative society in a distant state, that Caldern
would not go, and, the property being his wife's he
could not control it so he had left in disgust.</p>

<p>I felt that all was not told but I made no comments,
asked no questions. The colony proved a
failure. Finally Mrs. Caldern, her two girls and
Burns came to the very town in which I was living
and then she told me her story. She said:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"My parents came to this country from England, were
poor and the whole struggle was to get a home. It was
work, work, work, and no chance for school. George
taught me about all I know since he came into the family&mdash;to
spell, to write and many other things. My parents were
Methodists, my father being as severe as an Englishman
can be. Dancing was considered a deadly sin. One night
when I was supposed to be in bed I slipped through a window
and went to a dance near by; my father found it out,

<!-- page 150 -->

went and made me go home, then stripped me to the waist
and whipped me till the blood ran down my back. Shortly
after this I went to work for a lady who had a brother
living with her. He invited me out riding one Sunday, took
me into a drug store and treated me to some kind of simple
drink and that was the last I knew for some hours. My father
found out what had happened and made him marry me.</p>

<p>"Less than fifteen years old, a child wife unloving and
unloved he took me to his mother's and we lived there two
years, the mother keeping watch and when there was any
sign of pregnancy forcing me to drink something that would
bring me around again, I working in the meantime like a
slave. At the end of that time we went to live by ourselves,
and then I had my first baby, its father angry because
it had been allowed to come. Mr. Caldern had no
faculty of making a living, always complained of being sick,
and did not try to work in the winter. I took in washing,
went out washing and did anything and everything I could
to keep from going hungry and cold.</p>

<p>"Finally father died. The place we had worked so
hard to secure had become valuable and my share enabled
me to go into a hotel, and soon after George came to board
with us. I had rebelled against Mr. Caldern's sexual
claims and was not living with him as a wife, but I had to
watch continually to protect the girls I hired from his approaches.
George was very kind to me, and in spite of myself
I soon learned to love him. My son was then about
twelve years old and I had never known what love was.
He continued to board with us and plainly showed his attraction
to me, but for two years I resisted him.</p>

<p>"Finally one day there came up a sudden storm and we
ran up stairs to see to the windows; this done, he caught
me in his arms, made a few quick passes over my forehead
and eyes and I had no further power to oppose him. When
I found I was pregnant I favored Caldern just enough to
make him think the child was his, and then found an excuse
to break with him again. Finally, just as we were

<!-- page 151 -->

planning the colony which proved such a failure, I found
that he was beginning to tamper with our oldest girl, then
about thirteen. I then drove him off, took the two girls
and went with the crowd. I shall get a divorce, but I am
so much older than George I do not expect he will marry
me, but it is all the love I ever had. I know the world condemns
me but I cannot help it.</p>

</div>

<p>Such was the story she told me and there was
that about her which made me feel she told the truth.
They went away from the place soon after and I have
lost track of them, so I do not know if they are together
yet or not. One other thing that she told me
it may be well to repeat as it has a bearing upon the
question we are seeking to solve. Mr. Burns was a
fine writer, a more than average intellectual man,
and in speaking of the tie between them she said:</p>

<p class="small">"I can't understand it, but when his brain gets weary
and he cannot write, he will come to me and if I can take
the time to take his head upon my breast, put my arms
around him and hold him so for awhile, he can then study
and write for hours, sometimes all night."</p>

<p>That woman had been prostituted in all the sex
relations she had ever held till she met this man, and
yet her relations with him were the only ones for
which the world condemned her. Oh, purity, how
thou art outraged! Oh, woman, how thou art enslaved!
And how thou huggest thy chains lest the
world should see thy wounds!</p>

<p>"But where is the use of uncovering these private
histories," is the question asked; "so long as
people refuse to obey God's laws so long will these
things be and we cannot help it. People must obey
or suffer the consequences."</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p>Yes, genuine obedience to moral or physical law
brings its certain results, but who was guilty in the
case of this woman? Who or what was and is responsible
for what she did that has brought her so much
suffering? Ignorance of law&mdash;of the innate workings
of that universal life which is personified as God.
That father had been wrongly taught and he attempted
to enforce what he called God's law when by his
severity he crushed his child's power of self-assertion
by those cruel blows because in defiance of his commands
she obeyed the natural law of her own young
life and sought such social pleasure as was her right.</p>

<p>In his eyes she had doubly disobeyed, doubly
violated God's law, she had disobeyed her father and
she had danced, but the facts of the case were he had
no right to forbid her the natural and innocent pleasures
of youth, and she really obeyed life's law&mdash;that
life which is called God when she disobeyed that tyrannical
command, but in this her moral sense was
wounded <i>because</i> of her wrong teaching. She <i>believed</i>
she did wrong in disobeying her father. She could
not understand that disobedience to tyranny was really
obedience to the great law of progress. She had
a right to amusement, youthful, social life, a right to
the pleasure such association affords, and though
believing she was doing wrong the inherent claim to
her natural right was too strong to be restrained
even under the reproof of a wrongly educated conscience.
She obeyed the true law as expressed
through all young creatures&mdash;the love of sport, of
playful social life. Thus the true God-law was
obeyed in spite of prohibitory ignorance, but only temporarily,

<!-- page 153 -->

and at what a fearful cost to that poor child!</p>

<p>The father's ignorance violated his child's rights
through arbitrary restraint. The young man violated
the girl's right to herself, to intelligent mutuality and
then the father violated the rights of both by forcing
upon them an undesired legal tie, thus making the
first great wrong perpetual. Marriage, a legal tie,
was under the circumstances considered reparation.
The curse of that kind of reparation will be felt in the
coming generations. Those children born only of
the flesh, and undesired at that, can ever rise only
through great suffering, even if it be possible to overcome
their heredity in this life. The mother's heart
has already been wrung beyond the power of words to
express by the waywardness of the daughter of that
marriage, and what is to come remains to be seen.</p>

<p>But what of Burns' child, it will be asked. A
bright child; one of considerable promise, but how
can she be entirely truthful in her nature when the
whole period of gestation was one of deception. The
mother's starved nature asserted itself, but at what a
price! Why, in the case of this outraged woman,
child, rather, was marriage considered reparation?</p>

<p>Because only the physical quality of sex is recognized.
Because a woman is considered ruined if she
is thus possessed without legal sanction. In a word,
from the cradle to the grave no woman belongs to
herself. Oh, if woman could only see what this
slavery means&mdash;how it curses the race, could see
what freedom means&mdash;see that intelligently used it
would become the gate-way to a perfected life, she
would never rest till it was fully secured.</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>The last I knew of this couple they were still together,
but the woman's life was a martyrdom. Their
relation still unacknowledged, and, refusing to become
a mother again under such conditions, she destroyed
the foetus. He would not give her up and
she was not strong enough to resist one whose touch
so thrilled her, so her life speeds on under these sad
conditions. My heart aches every time I think of
her&mdash;the poor, wronged soul.</p>

<p>Do I justify her course? I do not condemn her,
and mark you&mdash;proud ladies, who glory in being
"chaste as ice," there is not one of you, but, with the
same organization and under the same circumstances,
would have done just as she has done. I pity her.
I feel that she has been more sinned against than sinning,
and I love her.</p>

<p>Were woman free and the conditions of society
adjusted to that freedom, such things would never be.
Unacknowledged relations would be unknown, while
now the children whose legal and real father are not
one and the same, would, were they all brought together,
astonish by their number those who look only
upon the surface of things. Evidence of woman's
perfidy, do you say? Evidence that nature is stronger
than statute law&mdash;evidence that some will take by
stealth that which should be theirs by right.</p>

<p>Now don't be frightened into thinking that in
freedom woman would run wild; don't picture what
would be by comparing it with what now is, but remember
this, now and always, when you think of
freedom for woman: No woman would ever submit
to an unwelcome embrace. Not only this, but as lovers

<!-- page 155 -->

would never insist, demand, as too many husbands
do, no woman's sex life would be destroyed because
rudely treated.</p>

<p>In the past woman has been obliged to submit,
but things are changing. Woman is waking up to
the fact that there is more to her selfhood than sex&mdash;that
she was not created simply as an instrument of
man's pleasure. If there is any truth in the words:
"By their fruits ye shall know them," then the fruit of
man's rule in sex forever condemns said rule.</p>

<p>I have recently been reading some of Mabel Collins'
books, and in those eastern ideas are many things
to be learned. Morial the Mahatma is the most perfect
character picture of the Jewish Jehovah I have
ever seen. "The ashes of the heart"&mdash;the death of
all human loves, the most unquestioning obedience
demanded; lies, hypocrisy, anything in the service of
"The Master. "</p>

<p>Daphne will not violate her own sense of right in
blind obedience. She defies and thus conquers, thus
destroys the fearful monster. This is what woman
must do in asserting her right to herself. She must
defy the power that enslaves her, must refuse to be
prostituted legally or illegally, and nature knows no
prostitution but unwilling subjection.</p>

<p>Another book of Miss Collins' has Fleta as the
central figure&mdash;Fleta who seeks to enter where woman
has never yet gone&mdash;into the Order of the White
Brotherhood, but fails because she has not cast out
all human love. She says she has consumed her soul
but not her heart. Fleta's mistake, as I see it, consists
in trying to reach only the highest that <i>man has

<!-- page 156 -->

attained</i>. She does not seem to get even a glimpse
of the possibility of there being a higher. Some woman
will yet establish an Order of the Loyal Sisterhood&mdash;and
with the determination of wrenching from
man his usurped place of the highest&mdash;this by rising
above him into her own true realm, that of Universal
Motherhood. Oh, how much this world needs a
Mother.</p>

<p>Such ascent will not demand the ashes of the
heart but its divinest, pulsating life. Man seems to
think that the path to purity lies through the crucifixion
of sex and the tearing out from the heart of all
human loves connected with and springing out of sex-relations.
I mean such men as aspire to holiness, so-called,
to such priestly place and power as allies them
with the gods. But woman can see pure uses for sex
and in the loyalty of her mother soul will yet make a
path for herself that will not need sex crucifixion, but
the exaltation of <i>all the human</i> till in perfect accord
with the divine.</p>

<p>When this comes true such sad histories as that
of my friend as related in the first part of this chapter,
will be unknown. I am glad Fleta failed; am glad
that she could not tear all human love from her heart
and live. I thank the writer of "Blossoms and Fruit"
for the suggestion here given, for in it there is hope
for the hungry heart of the race. Yes, I am glad
Fleta failed of reaching man's highest ideal, even as
all women must fail who try to walk in man's paths
instead of making one for themselves.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE CHILDREN OF LUST.</p>

</div>

<p>In the June Arena for &mdash;95 the editor, B. O.
Flower, quotes from a lady physician who says that
so many girls fall because being born of lust instead
of love they inherit lustful desires, strong passional
natures.</p>

<p>All are born of lust who were begotten by those
who regard sex as simply of the flesh; that is, they
are born with desire in the ascendancy, not subject to
the control of the spiritual by a law of their nature,
but must come into that condition through such suffering
as brings growth.</p>

<p>Mankind do not love change. I mean such
change as involves reconstruction. Were it not so
pitiful it would be amusing to watch the efforts made
to prevent the evils which are the natural, the inevitable
result of the system under which we live. It
cannot be done. If it could, if such evils could even
be kept out of sight, there would never be reconstruction
upon a higher basis.</p>

<p>Society to-day is a problem wrongly stated. The
desired solution can never be reached till there is a restatement,
and our reformers are going through experiences

<!-- page 158 -->

similar to one I had many years ago while
teaching a district school. In a new edition of the
arithmetic in use there had been added six pages of
miscellaneous examples. I commenced solving them
for I wanted to be certain that I could do so before
the advanced class reached them. It would have been
very humiliating to have to say to a pupil, I do not
know, I cannot show you.</p>

<p>I found no difficulty with the exception of one
problem. That I could not understand and I could
find no one who did, for the superintendent of the
county schools was as badly puzzled as myself. Having
no idea of giving up beaten I stated, restated and
kept at work, but all to no purpose. I could nearly
get the solution but not quite; there was always a
residue unaccounted for. Night after night I lay
awake hour after hour, multiplying, dividing, subtracting,
carrying each part in my head till, if all had
been represented on my pillow, it would have been
entirely covered in the morning.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening as I sat looking into the
fire and thinking, not of the bible nor of a sermon
but of that problem, all at once I saw the principle involved
and then knew under what rule it came. I
had no farther trouble. A correct statement and the
solution was sure.</p>

<p>Is it not just possible that all the efforts of the
past and present have hitherto failed to solve the social
problem, to eliminate the social evil because the
real nature and power of sex, never having been understood,
we have all along been working upon a
wrong statement of the principle involved, and is not

<!-- page 159 -->

that principle found in the demand for the unqualified
freedom of woman, and the adjustment of all departments
of society to harmonize with such freedom?</p>

<p>Taking things as in nature, we find that the rivulet
bordered with flowers and meandering through
grassy meadows, does not require a channel like unto
that of the mighty river upon whose bosom ships may
glide. There is as much difference between the volume
and strength of people's sex natures as there is
between the rivulet and the river. Both rivulet and
river are of use, but neither would be if made to occupy
the channel of the other, or perhaps an arbitrary,
law prescribed channel suited to neither. Any
one suggesting such a thing would be counted insane,
but when it comes to the streams of sex life there is
but one channel provided&mdash;legal marriage.</p>

<p>Both church and state say: "Flow through that
channel or not at all," and even till now, the effort is
made to abate the social evil by trying to hold everybody
to the one measure. The social evil is but an
overflow of unbalanced conditions. Give to woman
the freedom here demanded for her, and she will find
the balance. The woman who has not grown large
enough to feel her chains cannot do this work, that
of so balancing the life-forces as to heal the existing
diseased condition, because not thinking "to the bottom
of things; but woman is thinking the thoughts
that bring growth, and when she has burst every
bond we shall have no more "children of lust."</p>

<p>Perhaps no woman has hurled heavier missiles
against the evils which prevail under the present system,
has shown them up in more terrible colors than

<!-- page 160 -->

has Helen Gardener, but as far as I know, she has not
said a word against the cast-iron standard. She does
not seem to realize that "a society founded on the basis
of property, and not on the basis of life, can never
be other than the very thing she denounces."</p>

<p>These quoted words from a criticism by one of
her friends is true of more than Helen Gardener.</p>

<p>But very few of those who cry out against the
terrible evils which make one almost despair for the
race, seem to realize that society with its present basis,
"can never be other than the very thing it is."
"The children of lust" are a part of the fruit of the
tree under the shadow of which they sit, and on the
roots of which they shrink from using the axe.</p>

<p>And yet it must be done; for until it is, until the
basis of society rests upon life, upon its requirements,
instead of as now upon property, we shall continue to
have, not only children of lust, but of every tendency
which in culmination, places men and women in prison,
in some asylum, or finally to have their bodies
carted to the potter's field, filled with rottenness that
pollutes both soil and air; for, as the same writer says:
"There is no medication which will do good when
administered to mere results."</p>

<p>"Upon the basis of life." Is our standard of morality
thus founded? Are the needs of life considered
in its cast-iron code? The words of the ancient writer:
"For the bed is shorter than that a man can
stretch himself on it, and the covering is narrower
than that a man can wrap himself in it," are emphatically
true of our moral requirements which, as they
have been formulated with the idea of obedience to an

<!-- page 161 -->

impossible personality named God, have so hedged
us round that the God-power within us finds small
room for expansion if true to said requirements.</p>

<p>But Helen Gardener's admiring critic declares so
much truth I must quote further. After expressing
his appreciation of her fearless denunciation of wrong
he tells her she has not "thought to the bottom of
things," and then adds in reference to what he says
must be done to reach existing evils:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Of course these truths are bitter and burning. We know
well that they lead logically to revolution and to the total
reconstruction of modern society. And it will come to that.
Soon or later society must be reconstructed on the basis of
life. We must begin with what the man is, with what the
woman is, what the child is, and not with what the man
has, what the woman possesses and what the child can get.</p>

<p>Go on, ye reformers! But soon or later you will find it
necessary to cut down to the disease, and to rebuild to the
bottom the whole social structure on the ultimate principle
that life is the first thing and possession only an accident.</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, upon the basis of life&mdash;of its needs; but the
present structure is not based altogether upon property.
There is the idea of what God wants&mdash;what God
commands. Humanity has been laid at the feet of a
supposed personality, and has hitherto been a perpetual
sacrifice. If society is to be reconstructed upon
the basis of life, creative life as existing in ourselves,
must be recognized as of paramount importance, and if
life is first, it follows as a logical sequence that all else
must yield to life's needs. But to properly meet those
needs we must understand them, must study life in its
basic department, not from a pre-established standard
which has hitherto failed, but we must find the principle

<!-- page 162 -->

involved, or the problem can never be solved.</p>

<p>In the same issue of The Arena from which we
have quoted the editor condemns in unmeasured
terms 'prostitution in marriage.' He is another who
has not 'thought the question to the bottom.' An article
against the misuse, the waste, the extravagance
of those who hold the wealth of the country would be
just as much heeded. Both the property system and
the marriage system, as they now are, must go before
prostitution, either in or out of marriage, will
cease. The following article taken from "Foundation
Principles" will give an idea of what I mean.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">THE KEY NOTE.</p>

</div>

<p>The Editress of that excellent Journal, <i>Humanity and
Health</i> says:</p>

<p>"Ex-Judge Duffy has, we think, sounded the key note
to a solution of the social evil. He says 'look to the factories.
Underpaid labor of girls and women is responsible
for the root of the evil.' Through ill-paid labor the responsibility
of woman's degradation is again placed upon
the man's shoulders. He says: 'The money spent in alleviating
the condition of fallen women should be expended in
helping destitute women and girls whom necessity and
poverty would otherwise force upon the streets. It is a
good scheme to lock the barn door before the horse is stolen.'
In other words, prevention is better than cure. Again,
'How can a young girl who earns from three to four dollars
a week, working from daylight till dark, resist temptation
when so many inducements are held out to her by men who
prey upon innocence.' To discover the source of the social
evil, I would advise a visit to some of the factories where
women and girls work for starvation wages!"</p>

<p>Neither "looking to the factories" nor to any other place
where women work for "starvation wages" will give the
"key note" to the social evil. The key note which produces
this discord in society lies in the imperative need that men
have for the finer, more spiritual sex element of woman.</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>I mean just what I say: Imperative need. This need
is for that which will unfold intellectual and spiritual power.
Men name it physical necessity, and by thus mis-naming it,
fail of gaining what they are hungry for, because they do
not understand what that hunger calls for. The following,
taken from "The Occult Forces of Sex," but with a slight
modification of the wording, will perhaps better express
what I mean:</p>

<p>"Men hunger even till they devour woman, and yet they
do not obtain because they do not know that spirit must
gestate from matter food for the spirit body, the hunger
of which is driving them to desperation. Not knowing
this, they do not reach out from the spirit, but simply seek
to consume the mere physical on the altar of unspiritualized
desire."</p>

<p>Quoting still further from the argument for the refining,
regenerative uses of sex, I take from pages 55 and 56 of the
same work the next two paragraphs.</p>

<p>"In view of the law that leads to regeneration, it will
be seen that all efforts to prevent conception are unnatural
and, of course, deleterious; and the only way in which excess
of population can be legitimately prevented, is for the
parties to sex relations to respect the creative act by recognizing
the spiritual therein, thus drawing to themselves
<i>spiritual elements</i> to supply material waste, till the refining
process takes them out of the propagative plane by placing
them squarely in the road that leads to regeneration.</p>

<p>"Facts will be asked for in confirmation of this theory.
They exist: but those who are spiritual enough to perceive
the law and fortunate enough to be happily mated, by following
it out will soon find that their own experiences are
sufficient; and to give the experience of others to those who
cannot trace this law, would be of but little use. However,
this much may be said: The indications are that woman
first reaches the plane from which she can give of the
spirit to her companion, and he, having caught the spark of
immortality, soon develops to the point from which he can
return it to her. Is this the reason why man seeks woman
so persistently, and then, oft times, turns against her so
cruelly? Is it the unconscious power of that inner sense
which feels what he must receive from woman but has not
yet learned to know what it is? Is it not the mute language

<!-- page 164 -->

which says to the ears of those whose understanding
is open?"&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">I am starving&mdash;starving for that which will help me to grow
toward life. I felt that I should find what I need in this woman.
The attraction said "Yes," the facts said "No." She has deceived
me and I hate her.</p>

<p>"More likely the attraction told the truth, and that the
facts are of your own making. In your rude eagerness,
you, no doubt, shut the door against yourself&mdash;crushed the
germ which would have ripened into the bread of life for
you."</p>

<p>Yes, I am fully satisfied that the true reason is here given
as to why man seeks woman so persistently. He does
feel&mdash;sense, what he must receive from woman, but has not
learned to know what the feeling means; so he destroys woman
because of his ignorance, and still seeks&mdash;unsatisfied,
though scores go down to minister to his hunger.</p>

<p>Poor, starved ignorance! and yet such men sit in judgment
upon women and imprison men who dare to speak the
truth about the sex question. Oh, the pitiful degradation!
With their impure ideas of sex they make all things impure!</p>

<p>A leading New York physician, in a lecture before the
Anthropological Society in Feb. last, [93] after showing that
sex exists in everything, says:</p>

<p class="small">Always the same creative sex force, the omnipotent, omnipresent
God-power, filling all space, permeating all substance, producing
all life.</p>

<p>Of course its highest manifestation is in the human creative
life, and the highest through the human lies in that
blending of sex, soul, and intellect which tends to refine, elevate,
spiritualize the parties to the union. But how can
such results be expected where only the physical in sex is
recognized, where creative desire is counted merely lust?</p>

<p>So I repeat: The key note to the social evil can be found
in man's imperative need of that fine, spiritual sex element
which only woman can give. But she must give freely; man
cannot force it from her; it must go to him on the lines of
love and intelligence.</p>

<p>This being true, the key note to that which will do away

<!-- page 165 -->

with the social evil lies in the direction of freedom and
knowledge. Woman must be made so free that she need
nevermore yield herself except from responsive love and desire,
and man must become intelligent enough to know
that only in willing, glad response, can he receive any real
benefit.</p>

<p>We have somewhere about one hundred thousand so-called
ministers of God in this country who are supposed to
tell us of God and his law, but when we try to teach bottom
truths, try to find and obey the inexorable laws through
which this "omnipotent, omnipresent God-power" acts,
we are "obscene" and must shut up, or be shut up.</p>

<p>A score of years of persistent effort, such as honest,
earnest ministers put forth in their attempts to make people
fear and obey God, and with only a tenth of the number
employed in that line&mdash;a score of years devoted to studying
and teaching the laws that govern this creative "God-power,"
sex, and equal efforts to secure conditions for its
highest action, would do more for the race than has all the
theological teachings the world has ever known.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Imperative need." How many of our moralists
recognize such a need as an existing fact! True,
they talk of love as the true sanction for sex association,
but how few perceive this great spiritual law of
growth. Mr. Flower, and he is but one of many who
do this, seems afraid that he will not be considered
sound on the marriage question while denouncing
prostitution within the marriage bond, for he says:</p>

<p class="small">I yield to no man in my regard for the sacred relations
of married life: the sanctity and purity of the home I believe
to be essential to enduring civilization.</p>

<p>This because in daring to say that the woman
who bears children to a man she loathes, because he
happens to be her husband and she can do so and be

<!-- page 166 -->

accepted by society, is doing that society a greater
wrong than does the girl who yields to her lover
without the marriage bond, he seems to fear, as above
said, that he will not be considered quite sound as to
the necessity of marriage, and yet, in his closing paragraph
he adds:</p>

<p class="small">It is to emancipated womanhood that we must turn for
that moral reformation which shall redeem the world. High
and noble as woman has proved herself to be, we have not
yet seen her at her best, for we have not seen her strong
in the possession of justice and freedom. Indeed, with
Gerald Massey we can say that as yet,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"We have but glimpsed a moment in her face
The glory she will give the future race."</p>

</div>

<p>The gentleman does not seem to see that the woman
he paints is the "free woman" to whose freedom
all the conditions of society must be adjusted. He
does not seem to see that such a woman can never be
held by external bonds, and if she cannot thus be held
why have them? As to the difference between the
prostituted wife and the young girl, both are weak.
The girl does what she does not believe to be right
because too weak to resist the entreaties of the man
she loves; the prostituted wife continues to endure
because too weak to assert her right to herself. Neither
of them belong to the class of women who will
"give glory to the future race." It looks as if Mr.
Flower was trying to clean out the old bottles for the
new wine. Better break them.</p>

<p>Suppose we change the previous quotation; suppose
we make him say:</p>

<p class="small">I yield to no man in my regard for the sacredness of
property rights; I believe the sanctity of such rights are essential
to enduring civilization.</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>Would not such language indicate that he sustained
the system while repudiating what he would
thus designate its abuses? It certainly would, and
yet the abuses, so-called, are not fungus upon the
system but a legitimate outgrowth. Surely, he "has
not thought the question to the bottom," or he is false
to his deepest convictions, and this I cannot believe.</p>

<p>The marriage relation as regulated by statute and
the property system belong together, and they must
stand or fall together, but the sacredness of the family,
her family, will be well guarded by the free woman.
Nothing will be allowed to enter that can defile.
Then there will be no children of lust for she
will yield herself only where she loves and being both
free and strong, she will give character to the child
of her love.</p>

<p>Society to-day is the child of lust. The love element
is a negative, not a controlling factor. The
child of the bound woman cannot be heir with the
child of the free woman. But the time is drawing
nearer. Woman is growing stronger; she will yet
burst her bonds, and then we shall more than
"glimpse" the glory of the future race.*</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">ABNORMAL SEXUALITY.</p>

</div>

<p>B. O. Flower in discussing this question, says:</p>

<p class="small">Nothing is so fatal as silence in the presence of immorality,
for the hope of redemption lies in awakening the
conscience of the people, but so long as the pulpit, the press
and the rostrum avoid their discussion, so long as the facts
are smothered, there can be no moral reformation.</p>

<p>The press cannot give the facts without risking
prison, and the pulpit and rostrum can speak only at
the risk of starvation. I wish I could find language
to express the "why" of this but as it needs a volume
to illustrate the point, I will only say this: The necessary
conditions for a pure, healthy sexual life socially
cannot be had till our property system is entirely
changed and our ideas of sex morality cease to be
based upon the arbitrary commands of a supposed
personality called God.</p>

<p>Abnormal sexuality, as I see the law, is the result
of the attempted enforcement of a false standard
of morality, false from nature's standpoint, said false
standard being founded upon commands said to have
come from God and then crystalized into statute law
as well as into public opinion. In a pamphlet now
out of print in which an attempt is made to show up

<!-- page 169 -->

some of the evils of the personal God idea, I find the
following in reference to the Jewish Jehovah, the
writer taking the ground that he was and is but an
earthly spirit with boundless ambition:</p>

<p class="small">This spirit had learned that power-strong magnetic
attraction and executive ability was always coupled with a
strong sex life, and regarding man as superior, he looked
upon woman as especially made to gratify man and bear
children, so the first step toward the dominion sought was
to formulate a sex morality that would keep woman in subjection,
making her highest honor to consist in bearing
children and being faithful to her husband.</p>

<p>This morality under the old Jewish law allowed
men all the wives they chose, and while the later
idea, as said to have been given by Jesus, is the dual
relation toward which the race is tending, the morality
of the Jewish God still prevails either openly or
secretly. Those who have wealth can have as many
victims as they choose. All the environments of society
tend to sacrifice women, directly or indirectly,
and in doing this man is a victim also, the victim of
his own ignorance and love of power. The social
evil has so far been the bane of the race, <i>and the more
it is condemned and still continued, the greater becomes
the curse;</i> and continued it will be so long as
the present economic conditions exist and the present
ideas of morality prevail.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">WHAT THEN SHALL WE DO?</p>

</div>

<p>Measure morality by human needs. Neither
God nor Man has the right to say to one who has
large demands sexually, you shall not meet those demands
in a natural, normal way with those who desire

<!-- page 170 -->

you. The fact of such demand and the fact of a
supply guarantees you that right so long as there is
no intrusion upon others. But so long as we think
such people low, and as far as it is in our power,
make them think so too, so long will that which rightly
used, would be an upbuilder, so long, with the low
idea, will it be a destroyer. As before said, the more
condemned the greater the curse.</p>

<p>Self-respect is an absolute requirement as a basis
for a noble character. If sex is low, then sex desire
is low, is something degrading whether controlled or
not. One of the most conscientious women I ever
knew said to me:</p>

<p class="small">I came to womanhood with the idea that purity was
without desire, and when my own nature awoke I despised
myself because I could not subdue it. There was a constant
war between my ideal and what I found to be true
of myself, and that was what forced me to investigate this
question. I could not live with facts and conscience continually
at war. I must be reconciled to myself.</p>

<p>The conflict was between nature's facts and a
false ideal. Had she been unable to so re-adjust her
ideal as to be in harmony with the facts, her self-respect
would have been so wounded that she, no
doubt, would have lost her balance and gone down.
No, I am not <i>advocating</i> immorality. I am trying to
learn what true morality is. It is very easy to say
that sex life should be regulated by a given standard,
but no matter how imperative the <i>say</i>, nor how severe
the condemnation for not obeying that <i>say</i>&mdash;the rules
laid down&mdash;there has never yet been a power brought
to bear, strong enough to enforce said rules.</p>

<p>The question to be solved then, is the why of this.

<!-- page 171 -->

Why is it that mankind will not obey? Is the fault
in the race or is it in the standard. "The devilish
intensity of sex desire." Shall man, shall a woman
who is thus endowed be forced to endure this intensity
which is torture, must their lives be one long
struggle in order to please those who know little or
nothing of such desires?</p>

<p>It never has been done. It never can be done.
If one has a fine musical talent, if one is a natural
artist, if one has wonderful mathematical or mechanical
powers, there is no attempt to suppress or regulate
by a mediocre standard, and a highly wrought sex
life is just as natural, just as right, as is any other
highly developed power.</p>

<p>"Oh, but the unregulated use of sex is a curse,"
says one. I am not talking of unregulated use, but of
satisfying use. Woman is the natural regulator of
this power, it is her right, one of which she has been
deprived, one which must be accorded her, ere sex
ceases to produce the social evil. The use of sex is
not what produces the curse, but the attempt to gauge
the sex life by a given standard, condemning all seeming
surplus. Your thought, your condemnation, impinging
upon and overcoming the thought of the one
thus endowed, forces self-condemnation, because not
strong enough to endure self-torture through self-denial,
and that self-condemnation destroys the basis of
character, makes the parties feel "What's the use of
trying to be anybody?"</p>

<p>Let us look at a case or two by the way of illustration.
Here is a woman with large mother love. A
child is necessary, not only to her happiness but to

<!-- page 172 -->

health. She has a good home in her own right, and
a good income; she is abundantly able to provide för
one or more children, but man-made law says she
may not become a mother unless she pledges her body
to some man during life, and society says if she does
she shall thenceforth be an outcast. She would make
the pledge, she would marry, but the man who wishes
to own her, or by whom she is willing to be owned
does not come. But the life current is strong, and her
mother love is strong, and at last she shocks society
by obeying nature. She becomes a mother.</p>

<p>The world condemns. She is excluded from society.
She feels debased, degraded, not from the effects
of violated law, so far as nature is concerned,
but from an educated standard. However, she does
the best she can. She is satisfied with her child, feels
that it is all her own, and is content to care for it.</p>

<p>Three, four years pass; society still rejects her,
but nature again asserts her claims, and she once
more becomes a mother.</p>

<p>Double condemnation is her portion now. Her
relatives, who had partially forgiven the first offense,
now cast her off utterly and persecution meets her
on every side. Women forsake her and men crowd
themselves upon her, till, in endeavoring to protect
her person from an unwelcome embrace, she kills one
of their number.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a wretch! A Prostitute and a murderer."
No, she is neither. In becoming a mother
she did not prostitute herself. Nature knows no prostitution
for woman except, as before said, unwilling
subjection, and every woman has the right to protect

<!-- page 173 -->

herself from intrusion, even to the death of the intruder
if she cannot do so short of that.</p>

<p>It is so hard to make men understand that any
woman can really belong to herself. She belongs to
her parents or to the state, until the state can sell her
to some man who will promise to take care of her for
the use of her sex. Legally speaking, there are no
free women. Those who are called such are supposed
to be public property.</p>

<p>"Why can't I come here as well as Edwin," said
a man some years since to a woman who dared to
think for herself. The fact that she did not want him
was a sufficient reason, even had Edwin gone there
for the purpose he supposed, which was not true.</p>

<p>Such is the slavery of woman, a slavery, the root
of which is to be found in the personal God idea.
Yes, the first step of that personal God in seeking
universal dominion was to "formulate a sex morality
that would keep woman in subjection."</p>

<p>To this subjection, this false standard, I boldly
charge all abnormal sexualism, some of the manifestations
of which will now be given. It is not a desirable,
but a much needed work, and feeling this I
shall not shrink from possible consequences to myself.
I learned when a child that</p>

<p class="stanza">"One self-approving hour whole years outweighs
Of stupid starers and loud huzzas."</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps the following from <i>Lucifer, The Light
Bearer</i> (and surely we need a light to show up these
dark places) whose editor is now in prison for publishing
a letter denouncing a marital rape of the most
cruel nature and at the same time stating in plain

<!-- page 174 -->

honest terms the disabilities of married women, will
do to commence with. The article is somewhat long
so will condense by throwing out not needed paragraphs.
The writer says:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Whether Wilde be guilty or innocent his alleged vice is
no proof of insanity at all. It is simply a Grecian vice and
he is a great Greek scholar. We have been taught to consider
unnatural love between persons of the same sex was
the prevailing and fashionable love of the most refined
among nations ancient or modern. All Greek literature is
full of it, though it is less conspicuous in Homer than in
Xenophon, Plato and Theocritus. From Greece it spread
to Rome, and is found even in Virgil, whose "songs are
pure except that horrid one, beginning with <i>Formosum
pastor Corydon</i>." The most common phase is described in
law books as "<i>crimea, horribile, diabolice, deuaturatione, sodomia,
vel angliee, buggery.</i>" This was the bond of those extraordinary
Grecian friendships, such as Achilles and Patroclus,
Damon and Pythias. In some few Grecian states,
Sparta particularly, it was contrary to law. In others, as
Thebes, the government encouraged it. The poet Sophocles
was beyond measure addicted to it. It was the one irregularity
of Epaminondas, the most honest, unselfish, and patriotic
of all Greeks. He never married, though he was
rather old at death, but two young men are mentioned
among his loves. One gained a prize at the games, a very
great honor; the other fell by his side in the battle of
Matinaea. Far, then, from being contrary to the manly
virtues, it was considered their sure pledge. In the famous
Sacred Band of Thebes, lamented by as pure a Christian
professor as Mrs. Hemans, every man was bound to his
nearest comrade by this peculiar rite.</p>

<p>The practice has always shown a disposition to reappear
among soldiers, sailors, monks and other men who associate
with men only. The <i>mignons</i> of Henri III. were sodomites.
In Eau Claire, a few years ago, an Episcopal minister
was detected at this practice with young choristers,

<!-- page 175 -->

and thought best to emigrate. I could mention other recent
cases. Still another Grecian phase was between women&mdash;"Lesbian
love." Sappho is commonly, but perhaps
wrongly, accused of it. (See the College Greek Course in
English, published by the Chautauqua Society, under
auspices of Jo Cook, the late Rev. Howard Crosby, and
other equally notorious Comstockians.) In the two most
famous and influential dialogues of Plato the only question
discussed is whether intense affection between persons of
the same sex can exist without "unnatural" association.</p>

<p>Such practices are most unquestionably increasing in
both England and America. And who can wonder at it,
when Chautauqua and kindred institutions are at once encouraging
familiarity with this lascivious Greek literature,
and sending Harmans or Slenkers to prison for the calmest
discussion of sexual abuses? A more amazing inconsistency,
a more flagitious hypocrisy, this inconsistent, hypocritical
world has surely never seen.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Alice Mitchell killed her friend Freda
Ward, on the streets of Memphis, Tennessee, for repudiating
a promise to marry her. They made her out insane.
But half the papers very justly remarked, without seeing
the significance of their own observation, that if she were
insane her victim must have been just as much so. These
intellectual young ladies corresponded with each other in
Greek. We should greatly wrong the nation whose vices
they learned, by supposing them to have no discrimination.
We may make a beginning at comprehension of their feelings
if we learn, what is incontestable truth, that the corruption
or violation of a boy was, among them, even more
provoking than was a similar wrong to a woman. It was
this which drove from Athens the children of her tyrant
Pisistratus. But our high schools and Chautauquas are
teaching the vice without the virtue. There was a case
like that of Alice Mitchell some years before in Maryland.</p>

<p>I charge this blood upon the Jo Cooks, the Howard
Crosbys, the Charles Parkhursts, and the other obscenists

<!-- page 176 -->

who are stealthily teaching the worst features of Greek social
life to an intellectual few, while obtaining laws to prevent
its evils, and others more common, <i>from being known
to parents</i>.</p>

<p>I can imagine nothing more horrible than the tragedy
of these two poor girls, their brains boiling with Greek
conjugations, and their hearts with artificially cultivated
Greek passions, when they meet to enact such a Thebean
drama in an American city. The notorious case of a scholar
like Wilde, gave me hope that even secular papers would
bestow some attention on the growing evil. But with
Cook and Comstock before their eyes, they <i>will</i> not.</p>

</div>

<p>Unless endowed with the spirit of martyrdom
they <i>dare</i> not.</p>

<p>"I charge this blood upon the Jo Cooks, the
Howard Crosbys, the Charles Parkhursts, and the
other obscenists who are stealthily teaching the worst
features of Greek social life to an intellectual few,
while obtaining laws to prevent its evils, and others
more common, <i>from being known to parents.</i>"</p>

<p>If our readers will turn to Chapter V, they will
discern the reason of this&mdash;the subtlety&mdash;which seeks
to control everything by controlling sex. The "intellectual
few," in connection with the religious element,
must rule the world. It is the hope of continued
power, not an anxiety for the purity of the young,
that is the "power behind the throne" urging on the
persecution of honest students of sex for the sake of
Humanity.</p>

<p>As another illustration of the prevailing abnormality,
I will next take the following from my scrap
book. These things are readily found if looked for,
and sometimes they are thrust upon one:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Spent a half hour with a &mdash;&mdash; doctor the other day.

<!-- page 177 -->

He told me of a very wealthy man now in the insane hospital
who has furnished from his immense wealth $500 per
week for horses, carriages and everything that wealth can
purchase, together with attendants who see that he does
his precious self no harm. Cause of his condition, the habit
spoken of in the O'Neil letter for the publishing of which
Mr. Harman was sent to prison for a year.</p>

<p>Another wealthy man had come to him to be cured of
the same habit&mdash;his life forces drawn off unnaturally&mdash;said
it had become a passion, that he had not the strength to
stop, and the effect upon his brain was getting to be such
that he was alarmed, begged the doctor to give him something
to kill the desire.</p>

<p>"Why," he continued, "there is a woman in this city
who has nymphomania to that degree she claims she must
have sex association four for five times a day. She is well
connected, takes with her some tracts to give an air of respectability,
calls at different offices, gradually leads the
conversation toward the sex question and then makes her
wants known.</p>

<p>I know of men who are abnormal in their demands
but never want the same woman twice; and I can go over
here on 4th Ave. and for a dollar can see nude girls come
out and dance. What makes them do this? Poverty; they
always blush when they come out.</p>

<p>"You have seen them then," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have friends come in from the country who,
when their business is done, want to see the sights, and
want me to go with them. The fine forms of the girls are
calculated to stir a man but I can see syphilis all through
them."</p>

</div>

<p>This is the same doctor who said that a woman
who held sex relations with two men, one hers legally,
was a prostitute pure and simple, and he made
some pretty strong assertions as to what he would do
if it were his wife. I wonder what he would say if

<!-- page 178 -->

his wife should go with friends to see men dance nude.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as a sort of straw showing which way
the current of sex life flows, the following little incident
may be of use. Once at Omaha, Neb., when
waiting for the train to start there came in an old
lady whose remarks showed that she was from the
country, and took a seat immediately in front of me,
in which there sat another old lady.</p>

<p>"What, you here too," said the last comer in a
tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have worked hard all summer and I
thought I could afford a little trip."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like Omaha?"</p>

<p>"Very much; it's a splendid city and there's lots
of pretty boys here."</p>

<p>Oh, what a mistake! I think I must have been
dreaming when I wrote the above! It was two men
who thus conversed and one said to the other,
there's lots of pretty girls here, and the response was,
that's so.</p>

<p>I remember that at the time I reversed the sex
of the parties in my thought to see how it would
sound, and I have really written it out reversed in
the above. Well, no harm is done as I have explained.
I do not suppose they&mdash;the two old men&mdash;spent a
thought on the gray haired woman sitting behind
them, for it was "pretty girls" that attracted their
attention. Men looking for pretty girls is the rule.
Women looking for pretty boys is the far between
exception. "The imperative need that man has for
that which woman alone can give."</p>

<p>Let the reader go back to, and read again the article

<!-- page 179 -->

headed "The Key Note" and thus find why men
are looking for pretty girls. Always seeking; never
satisfied; because in their ignorance and love of power
they try to seize, or wheedle from, or buy of woman
that which can satisfy only when coming lovingly, intelligently,
and from&mdash;an equal. The man of whom
the doctor spoke as never wanting the same woman
twice was a sex dyspeptic, forever unsatisfied because
he did not know how to appropriate. Those of whom
Mr. Stead talks in his "Pall Mall Gazette revelations"
were of the same class. We give below, an extract
from Mr. Stead's own account of his interview with a
prominent London official:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Before beginning this investigation I had an interview
with one of the most experienced officers who for many
years was in a position to possess an intimate acquaintance
with all phases of London crime. I asked him:</p>

<p>"Is it or is it not a fact that, at this moment, if I were
to go to the proper houses, well introduced, the keeper
would, in return for money down, supply me in due time
with a maid&mdash;a girl who had never been seduced?" "Certainly,"
he replied, without a moment's hesitation. "At what
price," I continued. "That is a different question," he said.
"I remember one case which came under my official cognizance
in Scotland Yard in which the price agreed upon
was stated to be twenty pounds. Some parties in Lambeth
undertook to deliver a maid for that sum to a house of ill
fame, and I have no doubt it is frequently done all over
London." "But," I continued, "are these maids willing or
unwilling parties to the transaction?" He looked surprised
at my question, and then replied emphatically, "Of course
they are rarely willing, and as a rule they do not know what
they are coming for." "But," I said in amazement, "then do
you mean to tell me that in very truth actual violation, in
the legal sense of the word, is constantly being perpetrated
in London on unwilling virgins, purveyed and procured to
such men at so much a head by keepers of brothels?" "Certainly,"
said he, "there is not a doubt of it." "Why," I exclaimed,
"the very thought of it is enough to raise hell!" "It

<!-- page 180 -->

is true," he said, "and although it ought to raise hell, it does
not even raise the neighbors." "But do not the girls cry
out?" "Of course they do; but what avails screaming in a
quiet bedroom? Remember, the utmost limit of howling or
excessively violent screaming, such as a man or woman
would make if actual murder was being attempted, is only
two minutes, and the utmost limit of screaming of any kind
is only five." "But the policeman on the beat?" "He has no
right to interfere, even if he heard anything."</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Flower says in the same No. of The Arena
from which we have been quoting: "The traffic in
little girls may well thrill us with horror, but there
are other crimes even more revolting. A Messalina
or a Borgia is possible in any community where high
ideals are eclipsed by base imagining. Here is a case
in point taken from the New York Daily Recorder of
Jan. 31&mdash;94."</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Two young and accomplished girls, well known in New
York society, have sought asylum at the home of David
Mayer, the millionaire brewer, living at 1043 Fifth Avenue.
They were there last night, and have been there since last
Wednesday night, when they fled from their home. They
do not dare to return, because they declare that they are
in danger of criminal assault. Mr. Mayer has acted a very
noble part in the affair, and his entire family have co-operated
in the protection of the two worse than homeless sisters.</p>

<p>One evening upon returning to her home from a call,
the oldest daughter was horrified at a revelation made by
her younger sister. The elder daughter became frantic with
grief and confided to the younger girl her own awful secret.
The next day, after a night during which no sleep came to
them, the sisters decided that they must consult some one
about their awful positions at home. This they did. The
shock that the revelation made by the two young women
caused the friends of the family can hardly be imagined.
The repulsive nature of the story told by the two sisters
was such as to be incredible, had it not revealed unmistakable

<!-- page 181 -->

evidence of truth. And yet the kind-hearted people
who had received the confidences of the two young women
knew not what to do.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to print the story of these two
girls' lives as it has been told the Recorder. It is even asserted
that attempts were made to starve the sisters into
submission. The climax came on Wednesday night last,
when the girls were compelled, as a last and only resort, to
leave home and seek protection in the Mayer household.
Their exodus at dead of night was thrilling in the highest
degree. Locked in their rooms, the sisters waited until the
house was silent. They had dressed themselves for the
street, and as the night was cold they muffled themselves
for the journey that they had decided to make to the Mayer
homestead. Twice the poor girls began their descent of the
stairs in their own home, but, frightened by sounds that
they imagined were footfalls, they ran back to their apartments
and barricaded the door. About two o'clock, having
collected some of their trinkets, but utterly without money,
the two sisters, aged respectively twenty-two and sixteen,
made their way to the basement door and escaped into the
street. The stages had ceased running. The young ladies
hurried along Fifth Avenue to Mr. Mayer's house and were
received, after considerable delay, at the door by Mrs. Mayer.
She gave them asylum, because she knew them and
had heard their pitiful story. Since that hour these two
highly-cultured young ladies have had the tenderest care
from the Mayer family. Mr. Mayer defies all interference
from the parents of the girls.</p>

</div>

<p>"The story of these young women is almost too
horrible for belief," said young Mayer. "They escaped
from their own home by stealth. They were
friends of my sister and that is how we came to learn
of the indignities to which they were being subjected
in their own home. The cause of humanity dictated
that we should receive them here. Their condition

<!-- page 182 -->

when they came to us was pitiable, and the doctors
who have visited them say that their present physical
relapse is due to the want of food, which has been
withheld from them in order that they might be reduced
to subjection. This story, if it ever comes to
light, will shock the people of this city as they were
never shocked before."</p>

<p>What the particular form of abnormality it was
that those young girls escaped from is left to conjecture,
but I must again say that all efforts at arousing
the public conscience in this direction will prove a
failure till our standard of morality has been corrected.
Science will yet demonstrate that this question
of sex is more a question of health and personal rights
than of morality.</p>

<p>There is a cause for whatever it was that drove
those young ladies from home in the dead hours of
the night, and we shall never get hold of such causes
till there is a full and free field for investigation; and
the effects will not cease, all sorts of perversion will
prevail until the cause or causes are found and removed.
We have hardly touched this abnormality
subject, as yet; but will add no more now. When
the letters are reached, for the publishing of which
Mr. Harman and myself are prosecuted (persecuted),
there will be room for more comments.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">WHAT FREEDOM MEANS.</p>

</div>

<p>As already said, it is so hard for man to understand
that a woman can belong to herself. The man
who said, "Edwin comes here and why can't I," was
a church member who had repudiated his membership,
claiming to have become a Spiritualist. His
idea of Spiritualism was soon made manifest to be a
free field for his desires, and when he learned his
mistake he went back to the church.</p>

<p>Right here another incident comes to my mind
involving the slavery of woman. A Boston healer,
Joseph Newman, who was called by those who knew
him best "one of the white souls," was once telling
me of one of his patients, the wife of a prominent
church member who often came to him for treatment.
She was disgusted with her husband. His claims
upon her made her sick, but that husband (?) would
not get her a thing no matter how much she needed
it unless she would submit to his wishes, and then
she would have to go to the doctor for treatment.
After listening to his story I said:</p>

<p>"Doctor, what class of people who come to you
for treatment give the most evidence of sex abuse?"</p>

<p>"Church members," he unhesitatingly replied,

<!-- page 184 -->

"and the radicals called Freelovers, the least."</p>

<p>Now why was this? If freedom is dangerous, if
the prevailing idea of what freedom in sex matters
means were true the Freelover would have given the
most instead of the least evidence of the abuse of
those functions. The why of it is: The thinker upon
sex law, the one who knows that nature has her own
laws of purity independent of "Thus saith the law,
or thus saith the Lord," knows that he cannot violate
that law with impunity. He does not measure his
life by the legal but by the natural standard and he
would as soon think of taking fire into his bosom as
an unwilling woman.</p>

<p>But let us go back to the <i>supposed</i> case of the
woman, illegally a mother, who kills a man in self-defense.
She is either hung or imprisoned for life.
The fact that she has dared to claim the right to herself
in motherhood will bar her from sympathy.
Community will act toward her in the same spirit
manifested by the man who said, "why can't I come
here as well as Edwin?" It will be denied in fact if
not in words that she had the right to thus protect
herself. She was an outcast. Her children are left
unprotected; they become outcasts and all this is
charged to the woman's depravity; is looked upon as
the legitimate result of illegal relations.</p>

<p>No such thing. The woman only asserted her
natural, inalienable right to motherhood. She had
the means to care for her children and she wronged
no one. That which occurred belongs to society, to
the idea that human law can contravene natural right.
That which occurred, or would be likely to occur under

<!-- page 185 -->

such circumstances as we have supposed, is due to the
enslavement of woman.</p>

<p>I will now idealize a picture of freedom for woman
as I see it. Allowing time for an entire change
of status, but not yet time enough to do away with all
the hereditary imperfection of the past. Woman
is free; all men respect her inherent right to herself
and all women sustain themselves and each other in
that right. A woman accepts the man of her choice
without asking either church or state. She becomes
a mother; the father is glad and proud of the honor
she has bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Time passes, they are happy together, and after
awhile another child is born. Again the years roll
by, but in the end she finds she no longer desires him.
She does not understand why but knows there is a
cause somewhere. She tells him how she feels. "It
is all right, Margaret," he replies, "I know that you
must be true to yourself, know that unless your nature
calls for me we can do each other no good."</p>

<p>They remain friends, each loving and caring for
the children. At length she meets another man who
stirs the life current. He responds and they become
lovers. The first one does not feel wronged. He will
be called by another when the time comes. The woman
bears no more children. Their creative life goes
to their mutual upbuilding. Their souls grow so
strong that the inner, grander selfhood comes forth
into the external, fills the physical with such glowing
health that life is happiness.</p>

<p>But the time comes when this man is no longer
desired. In telling him of this she says: "I have

<!-- page 186 -->

hoped, Richard, that our union might continue, for
sometime, somewhere I shall find a perfect mate. I
have so hoped it might be you but it seems not."</p>

<p>"Do not grieve, dear," he says. "I thank you
for the honor, the happiness that has been mine with
you, and if I cannot fill all your being it is not your
fault. That which is unsatisfied has its rights and
must call for them."</p>

<p>"But I am calling for no one else, Richard."</p>

<p>"Not consciously as yet, Margaret, but it will
come. I am glad that we have met and loved for
we have helped each other to grow toward the perfect
state."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we have, but so many of my sisters
are making no change, have not from the first, I
begin to fear there is a law of change and I want rest.
The idea of continually changing is not a pleasant
one."</p>

<p>"Yes, there may be a law of continued change
for some, but were it the law of your being you would
not feel as you do; that feeling shows that what you
desire is for you, will come to you sometime. It
takes a long time to outgrow the effect of ages of enslavement,
and longer to round out great natures
than it does small ones."</p>

<p>She smiled at this, and looking at him tenderly
for a moment, said: "I should have been so glad if
this relation could have continued. Perhaps when I
have been alone awhile I shall turn back to you provided
you do not find happiness elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I should be proud and happy, dear, if it should
prove so," and the man turns away with something

<!-- page 187 -->

like a sigh. But he, like the other, knew too well
that only as she came to him freely could there be a
blessing between them, to make any plea in his own
behalf. Understanding that it is not her wish, but nature's
law, why use either persuasion or reproach?</p>

<p>We will now take a woman of quite a different organization.
She has large sex love and no desire for
motherhood. She is diffusive, can blend with different
men, is attracted to men of like nature with herself;
men who respect themselves and all women.
This woman is free as well as the other. No one
questions her right to herself. Those on the dual
plane say: "We have not learned all of nature's secrets;
there may be a use in this that we do not understand."</p>

<p>So she is not condemned, and not being crowded
into lying or hypocrisy of any kind, she is truthful,
honest, cleanly, kind, sympathetic, generous, all that
goes to make up a lovely character, and never being
held to an unwilling relation, she is healthy, happy,
and diffuses happiness wherever she goes.</p>

<p>Through freedom the very air has become vitalized
with the elements of a higher, purer sexual life,
a life that so fills the social sphere that the cruel,
torturing intensity of sex desire no longer exists.
Sex disease is unknown. The social evil is changed
into a social blessing, and progress is naturally assured.
What are now called houses of prostitution
would no longer prostitute, for all men would know
as well as did Margaret's companions that unwilling
submission would be a curse. All the conditions of
society conformed to woman's freedom, there would

<!-- page 188 -->

be no yielding for the sake of money, nor from any
other feeling than of attraction.</p>

<p>Man's need considered legitimate, those who had
no companions could find in places that are now condemned
but cannot be put down, such association as
would bless both parties and injure no one. There
would be no excess, no abuse, no drinking, and one
by one, as fast as harmonious mates were found, would
live the dual relation as truly and as purely as mated
souls can. Thus the race would finally reach its
ideal by having learned that only through the freedom
of woman can it be attained.</p>

<p>Yes, I know such ideas are shocking. But which
is worse, even to such as are shocked if they will be
honest in their judgment, the condition I have supposed
or what we now have? Remember, please,
that what now is, the unsatisfied, the starved, the
abused conditions of sex life fill the atmosphere with
their own emanations just as truly as do stagnant
pools, and foetid cellars, and susceptible persons take
on sex fever as well as typhoid or malarial fever.
Please remember that sodomy, and various other
forms of this sex disease are fearfully extant and
growing worse as our civilization intensifies in the various
classes struggling for supremacy.</p>

<p>And please remember farther that all past efforts
to suppress or regulate this disease of <i>intense</i> maddening
desire, all appeals to reason, to conscience, to the
law, or any other power has been an utter failure.
As well appeal to the fever scorched patient who has
become the victim of malarial swamps to keep cool.
The forces must be balanced; there must be no malaria

<!-- page 189 -->

of decay in the sex atmosphere, and only woman can
bring this balance, but to do so she must be free.</p>

<p>Right here I will repeat a short story to those
who are so shocked at my statement that what are
called houses of prostitution would prostitute no
longer. I was once conversing with a gentleman of
about sixty years of age who related the following
experience. He said:</p>

<p>"When I was about twenty five I went one night
while in Cincinnati to a house of prostitution"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you go there for!" I exclaimed in a
sort of amazed tone. It did not once enter my head
that he could visit such a place for the purpose for
which they exist.</p>

<p>"For sexual intercourse," he quietly replied, and
as I tried to swallow my blunder he continued:
"When I entered the parlor there were two girls talking
with gentlemen and a third sitting on a sofa with
a book of poems in her hard. I went and sat down
beside her, found she was reading a favorite author,
talked about him and his writings awhile, then gave
her a ten dollar bill and we went up stairs. She was
a refined, intelligent girl, and I could see she shrank
even while she assented.</p>

<p>"Once in her room she began telling me how
she came to be there. Her people were wealthy,
moved in the first circles of society. Her lover had
betrayed her and her parents had cast her off. She
knew nothing of work and there was nothing for her
but prostitution. 'Had my child lived,' she said,
'and could I have supported it, I could have been happy
even yet, but as it was, I must come here or drown

<!-- page 190 -->

myself and I had not quite the courage to do that;
but this life is becoming so terrible to me I may do
that yet. Were all who come here like you it would
not be quite so bad, but'&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here she burst into tears. I took her in my
arms, soothed her and we lay there and talked for
hours, I losing all desire for other association. I
was tempted to take her out of that and make her
my wife, but I had a mother and sister to support
and this girl knew nothing of work, so I resisted the
temptation. A few days after that I saw a notice in
the papers of the body of a young woman being
found in the river. Somehow I could not get rid of
the feeling that she was the one, so I went back and
inquired for her. I was told that she was not there&mdash;that
she had gone, they did not know where, but she
had left her trunk. I no longer doubted her fate."</p>

<p>Please, poor shocked sister, note the soul sympathy
developed between those two in that short acquaintance,
and remember that in the freedom and
mutual respect I have portrayed, there would be far
more likelihood of finding such soul sympathy elsewhere
than in such a house as my friend visited. The
tendency of all such sympathy is to subdue all <i>mere</i>
lustful feeling, as was the case with my friend. It
was the fact of knowing that he possessed so much
soul which called out the exclamation: "What did
you go there for!"</p>

<p>There are many thinking men and women who
will understand the illustrations of freedom for woman
that I have given, for they see the evils of the
present, and have also caught glimpses of the path

<!-- page 191 -->

that leads to full enfranchisement, know that the ideal
of the race can be reached only by giving each organization
its natural right to be itself. They see that
ignorance of life's creative laws, and the slavery of
woman, have produced a class of beings who cannot
live the dual life, cannot live in perfect matehood till
through many experiences they can grow into a condition
in which such matehood is possible.</p>

<p>But, if by condemnation we make such experiences
a curse instead of a blessing, we shall never be
able to lead them, or to let them find for themselves
the true path. One thing is certain: This path can
never be brought into line with legal environments.
No greater perversion of creative life can be possible
than that which attempts to hold it to an arbitrary
standard. As well attempt to erect a standard for
the winds and the waves; as well attempt to regulate
the stars in their courses as to attempt to hold human
sex life to a given creed&mdash;to make it flow only in conventional
channels. It never has been done; it never
can be done, and I do not in the least hesitate in saying
that the successful regulation of the sex relation
according to set rules involving the ownership of
woman's person, would have been far worse for the
race than all the excesses and irregularities which
have prevailed.</p>

<p>Yes, the latter have been very terrible, but less
so than the successful rule of ignorance in the same
field. I am told that every well-read Theosophist understands
that the root-meaning of the words: God
and Satan, is nothing more than the creative principle
indicated by sex when rightfully or wrongfully used.

<!-- page 192 -->

The creative, the God-life becomes Satan or devil-life
when abused. Now I ask in all sincerity if a living
Devil is not better than a dead God?</p>

<p>In other words, is not a perverted life better than
no life? When I look at the efforts that have been
made to crush, debase, spit upon sex as something
unholy, it seems to me that there are those who
would gladly rule sex out of the Universe in order to
purify it. Yes, a living power, even if perverted, is
better than a dead one, for with life there is hope,
hope that the perversion may be remedied, may get
into the right channel; but in this case it must follow
its own law to get there.</p>

<p>It may have to grow across lots, to undermine
stone walls, but as sure as you and I live, this creative
but perverted God-power will certainly find the
true channel of action if it is allowed to heal its
bruises in its own way and respect its selfhood in so
doing. Sex has been a curse because of ignorance and
the enslaved condition of woman. It will become an
unmixed blessing when the sex that has the power to
help or hurt the most, is free and intelligent.</p>

<p>But my shocked friend, the healing of the perversions
of sex life which have cursed the race involve
all I have portrayed as pertaining to woman's freedom.
Be her nature diffusive or exclusive she must
not be enslaved. One thing is certain, in freedom
she will never accept what she does not want, hence
the very atmosphere will no longer be filled with conflicting
forces. If those who are shocked at the
thought of such freedom for woman, can show us a
better way, let them do so.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch17">

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">WOMAN'S SOURCE OF POWER.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the evils that ignorance and a
false system of society have produced, woman, even
in her enslavement has, through the law of love,
gradually brought the race forward to a point where
reorganization upon a higher, broader basis is beginning
to be demanded. Thinkers see that there is no
help under the present system of society, and seeing
this, they are thinking, feeling, working for the new;
and this has come through a law of woman's nature,
the power of which she has as yet hardly caught a
glimpse.</p>

<p>Much has been written by men, giving directions
to woman during pregnancy, but results show that a
child cannot be built as one would build a house.
Students of heredity are beginning to learn that intellect
is not the governing power in life's processes.
In this grand laboratory of the soul, the intellect can
only act as the <i>servant</i> of love. I say laboratory of
the soul, because it is woman's psychic or soul nature&mdash;her
love life, that rules here.</p>

<p>Woman's nature is finer than man's; what she
loves, even to the garments she wears, are finer, more

<!-- page 194 -->

beautiful, and thus, through this love-law of her life
she refines the race.</p>

<p>This in a general sense, but when it comes to the
individual, it is what she loves or hates, wants or repels
that makes its impression upon her child. If
she follows a pursuit from a sense of duty, having at
the same time a strong dislike to it, her child will be
very likely to hate that pursuit; but if she does the
same thing from a love of it without once thinking of
it as a duty, or of its possible effect upon her child,
then the child that is gestated in the atmosphere of
that particular love will, most likely inherit the same
feeling in an increased degree.</p>

<p>But this feeling, this love must be a positive, not
a negative one. It must be strong enough to make
its impress on the embryo. For long ages woman has
been so subdued, so under the influence of the idea
that wifely duty was woman's true sphere, there has
been but slow progress, even though woman holds
within herself the law of progress&mdash;this because she
has been submissive in her loves. The Love-God has
been, is being, crucified in the person of woman.</p>

<p>But the redeeming feature of the case is, woman
has never loved her slavery. She has accepted it, often
gladly, because it brought what she desired and
could not, as conditions were, otherwise obtain, but
she has never loved the submission, the duty part of
her position which is the badge of her slavery, and because
of this, the love of freedom has not died out of
the race. Man, while demanding freedom for himself,
fails to realize that wondrous soul-power of woman
through which what freedom he has as yet gained has

<!-- page 195 -->

come to him; or rather, the desire for, and the power
to win this much is his because, while he lay beneath
his mother's heart she did not love her submissive
place, but rebelled in feeling.</p>

<p>That feeling, organized in the child, is gradually
pushing the race toward the desired goal, freedom.</p>

<p>If man realized this law of woman's life, he would
accord to her entire freedom of person, knowing that
only thus can the very root of tyranny be, so to speak,
gestated out of existence. Here I must say what will
shock an educated morality, but nature is stronger,
more true to the law of growth than are educated
standards that are not in harmony with nature's law.</p>

<p>Woman, not loving the bondage that makes her
person the property of one who, having bound her
legally, has made himself hateful to her, has in thousands
of instances defied that slavery by secretly following
her attractions, and the world is the better
for it. The children thus born are of a higher type;
they have better bodies and more soul than children
born of a union in which there was unwilling submission
on the mother's part, and only animal passion
lust, on the fathers' side. True, there is the element
of deception; but she has not loved the deception, has
resorted to it as the only method possible under the
conditions, and because of this the deception has not
made so deep an impression as it otherwise would.</p>

<p>What can we conclude then, but that in the soul
loves of woman lie the uplifting power of the race,
whether that love be organized in a child or blended
in the spiritual and intellectual aura set free through
mutual sex relations in which woman's sense of fitness

<!-- page 196 -->

is not wounded; in which she honors, uplifts, glorifies
both herself and her companion, all that is best, noblest
in both being thus combined on the creative
plane to produce an element of growth for each.</p>

<p>The man who has experienced the uplifting power
of such a relation can never be induced to debase his
manhood by debasing sex. But such uplifting, renewing,
purifying relations can not exist in their fullness
under any system which in the least binds or debases
woman. She must be free to live her own love
life, and to bring to it the highest, the best she can
command from the universe of life.</p>

<p>A case in the July Arena of 1895 shows something
of woman's power in maternity even under present
conditions. In speaking of woman's love nature
as the true source of her power in heredity, whatever
wounds that love comes under the same law, hence
the results as given in the story. The woman was
disappointed in her husband and wept much during
her first pregnancy. That child would stop in the
midst of its play and begin to cry. When asked what
was the matter she would say: "I's only tying."</p>

<p>During the gestation of the second child her husband
would sometimes abuse her, and then he would
want to make up and kiss and pet her. This was even
more repulsive than the abuse. When that child was
small, being attractive it was often caught up and
kissed by visitors, but it would invariably cry out "I
hate to be tissed, I hate to be tissed."</p>

<p>The reader will see that in both instances it was
the mother's feeling, not her intellect, that made its
impress upon the child. When intellect unites with

<!-- page 197 -->

feeling the result can, or may be modified, but when
working against feeling the intellect, as connected
with the law of heredity, can make little or no impression.
When I hear men say that woman's place
is in the home, and motherhood her work, I think:</p>

<p>"When you see to it that women have homes,
and such conditions as will make motherhood a blessing
to all concerned, then I will believe you mean
what you say. How few of the people have a home.
A hired place which one must leave at the will of another
is not a home. Garrets, cellars, and rat riddled
tenements furnish poor conditions for motherhood."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't help the poverty of the people."</p>

<p>Then there is that in woman's soul which, when
once aroused, will bring justice to all, even if your
whole fabric has to be taken down till there is not
one stone left upon another.</p>

<p>But I have not yet reached the point I desire to
make. The mother before spoken of bore yet another
child. During its gestation the poor woman, so disappointed
and prostituted in that unloving relation,
turned to literature for comfort. A neighbor loaned
her Swedenborg's works which she read with avidity.
"They seemed to carry me into a new world," she
said. Giving the rest in her own words:</p>

<p class="small">When that child came it was such a comfort to me. The
coronal region was marvelously developed and she seemed
to be a natural mystic. When quite young she evinced a
passion for metaphysical thought and would eagerly listen
to my reading works far deeper than could be comprehended
by any other child I ever knew; she did not reach maturity
however, falling a victim to the heroic treatment of a
physician.</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p>There is much to suggest thought in this story.
It will affect people differently. The feeling it gives
me is such that, could I inspire all women with it,
man's rule over woman's person would be forever at
an end. The idea that it is woman's <i>duty</i> to submit to
a husband when every fibre of her being rebels is one
that an incarnate devil ought to blush for, and yet
women are told that such is God's command, and she
is expected, not only to obey but to love such a being.
Could assurance go farther! But the thought of that
woman's position and of the forces which held her to
it have again taken me away from my application.</p>

<p>Had that mother been free, and could she have
had suitable conditions otherwise, that child would
have needed no physician. She would have possessed
a body so well balanced that her brain would have
had ample support; but as it was, the power of woman
in maternity is demonstrated. Woman is beginning
to see, and to feel, all this, is beginning to feel
that she cannot do good work under the conditions
man has provided; and, <i>feeling</i> this, she will soon demand
in such thunder tones, the conditions for perfect
motherhood that man will be compelled to accord
them&mdash;even to that freedom of person which I here,
as the yet unrecognized mouthpiece of the sex, am
demanding for her.</p>

<p>I have stated my belief that, other things being
equal, the love of woman acting secretly was more
likely to bring good results than are recognized but
repulsive relations. The two stories which follow
may help to show just what I mean. One of them,
and which I have reason to believe true, has been spoken

<!-- page 199 -->

of before, but it is particularly applicable here.
The other, whether true or not as to that particular
statement the results are in harmony with nature's
law, are what would be under the conditions.</p>

<p>An old lady, one of whose children had always
given her a great deal of trouble, and for whom she
was always trying to do, even after he had been many
years married, said one day when he had been more
than usually trying:</p>

<p class="small">I don't know if it was myself, society, or what was
wrong; I did what I thought was right, but had I followed
my feelings instead of what I had been taught, I believe it
would have been better for that boy. I did not want his father
at the time he was begotten, but the hired man. I
never cared very much for my husband; he was much older
than myself, but taking a liking to me he set himself to
win me and he succeeded. The longer I lived with him,
the less I liked him, and at that time, as I have said, my
feelings went toward the hired man. I thought I was very
wicked, believed I should be eternally lost if I yielded to
such a feeling, so the one I did not want became the father
of my child. In spite of my love for him, and his for me,
that child has always antagonized me; or rather, we antagonize
each other. With the knowledge I now have, were I
placed in such a position I should follow my attraction or
refuse the sex relation altogether.</p>

<p>The other story which I heard first at least forty
years ago, and have heard it at intervals ever since,
was like this: A woman with a weak, drinking husband
had reared a fine family of sons and daughters,
that were a credit to themselves and to society. In after
years, when the husband had died, a friend expressed
surprise that she had raised so fine a family
with such a father. Her reply was:</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p class="small">There is not one of them his. I saw right away what
his weakness was. I decided to stay with him but resolved
that he should father no child of mine, so I made my selection
on the outside.</p>

<p>I once told this story to a party of ladies who
seemed to feel that they were commissioned to watch
for sex delinquencies, then asked which was best, that
those children inherit the weakness of their reputed
father, or that the mother should provide against such
a result, and they straightway reported that I advocated
such a course. I was not&mdash;advocating&mdash;anything
but simply comparing evils; for surely, it was and
is an evil. No woman living chooses deception in a
case like that&mdash;because she loves the deception&mdash;and
it surely, is not a pleasant thing to be always guarding
a secret, and that which prevents human happiness
is evil. But as to the least of the two evils, I think
those children would be the best judges of that, there
is a character in Shakspeare who answers for them.</p>

<p>When the young man finds that he must lose the
inheritance because not the son of his reputed father,
he looks at his own magnificent physique, and
comparing it with the inferior form of the heir, tells
him to take the inheritance for he needs it, expresses
confidence in his ability to make his own way in the
world, then adds,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">And he who says my mother did not well,
This hand of mine shall send him straight to hell.</p>

</div>

<p>No, I am not advocating anything but such freedom
for woman as will do away with all deception.
But the main lesson of the last story must not be lost
sight of. With what is now known of woman's power

<!-- page 201 -->

in maternity it will be seen that the good heredity of
those children was as much, or even more, due to the
strength of character which enabled the mother to carry
out such a purpose, and maintain her self-respect,
as it was to the father she chose for them.</p>

<p>"To carry out her purpose and maintain her self-respect."
Such women as that and the one whose story
is next told are very rare. And yet, it is women
with a purpose in harmony with creative love, that
we need; for creative love intelligently applied becomes
redeeming&mdash;regenerating love. The following
letter was sent me by one of the world's thinkers,
saying she found it among a friend's papers after his
death. I am satisfied that the one who sent it to me
was the one who first wrote it, as that friend was her
lover and the letter was in her hand writing with the
first part, and the signature gone.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">THE LETTER.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>. . . . . . . I want to be loved by those I love, but if I
can have but one, let me love. I don't mean that clinging,
leaning on somebody that I have heard called love, for I
can stand alone, but I want an abiding faith in the goodness
and truth of a loved one. If a man can call out my
love, compel my love because of his manliness and worth,
he makes me a very happy woman, glad, joyful clear
through from core to cuticle. The more I love the happier
I am, so darling, I want to love you with all the fervor and
intensity of my nature&mdash;not love's young dream, nor first
love, but the earnestness of a loving, passionate woman
who has lived much, loved much, and suffered much.</p>

<p>In yours of the fifth, you say woman could not well
take the initiative in love matters because the man would
think she knew too much, had been there before. That

<!-- page 202 -->

thought struck me as it would have done to have gone
through the old home and somewhere in the garret to have
found the doll I played with forty years ago. I have a
vague recollection of having once entertained such sentiments
myself, oh, ever so long ago&mdash;several hundred years
ago I am sure.</p>

<p>Now, to the man that I could care enough for to associate
with I could tell my love experiences just as freely as I
could tell of the books I had read, or of anything else that
had been helps to me in my growth towards womanhood.
You see how it is, dear; unless you have gotten free from
the notions most men have you have no business with me.</p>

<p>Did I say what I did about going into a den of lions on
purpose to have you ask me what I meant? Did I know a
man's curiosity couldn't get by it?</p>

<p>No, I wrote it as it came to me. It was when I read it
over that I thought it would bring questions.</p>

<p>Well, if you can't love me knowing me as I am, I shall
love you all the same, but I want to tell you something of
my life, for should we ever meet I want to feel so free that
I can think out loud and not have anything to conceal&mdash;and
understand me, I don't tell it as a confession of wrong done,
nor as anything I am sorry for or regret in any way. I
simply wish you to know it, that is all.</p>

<p>I told you that after I had been here six years I went
home to where my father and mother were living. I went
from here the last of October. I found them living in a
house lathed but not plastered; my father 75 years old, and
not able to go out hardly at all&mdash;mother five years younger
but very feeble. They had not comfortable clothing, flannels
such as they ought to have and had always been used
to. My brother had gone away for the winter to work. His
young wife and two little babies made up the family.</p>

<p>I had only a few dollars. I was not a man or I could
have enlisted and the bounty would have made all right.
I might have married even then and so have given them a
home, but I thought there was a lesser evil. <i>This is what I

<!-- page 203 -->

did do</i>. I took what money I had except enough to take
me to some large city, and with it I set masons to work to
plaster the house&mdash;left promising to send money "as I knew
I could find work."</p>

<p>I did not expect to find work. I knew there was nothing
I could do but I went and found a way of getting
money just as thousands of women have done before. I
boarded in a "first-class" place as such places go, and in six
weeks went home again telling them I had drawn a prize
on a lottery ticket, and that was how I had money.</p>

<p>In January my father died. His sickness, doctor's bill
and burial used up my money and left debts, so I went back
again and stayed there till June. You see what I meant by
the lions. I had got over the idea of the sin of associating
with men outside of wedlock. It was not with me a sacrifice
of soul and body as some would have thought it, but all
my pride, all my prejudice, all my womanly delicacy had to
be trampled on. Then, too, I was afraid. I supposed every
man would treat me as badly as my husband had, so it took
a good deal of resolution to do as I did.</p>

<p>I found the devil not half as black as he had been
painted. Instead of coarse, brutal men I found the gay,
the polished and the cultured, all kind, and <i>seemingly</i> loving.
I was petted, flattered, caressed, and as I am telling all,
there I first learned what it was to be a woman. I had
lived three years with a husband, and afterward had a lover
for about two years, but I supposed all the time that the
orgasm was something peculiar to men and men only.</p>

<p>I waked up all over and gained the health that had not
been mine since marrying. Had there been nothing to complain
of but the sexual life I could have remained there
contented <i>at that time</i>. But there was too much wine and
nobody was <i>living their best</i>. There was no high aspiration
to make anything of life but a pleasure. It was no longer
the lion I feared, but the ass that I despised&mdash;so I packed
trunks and went back to the shop as the least of two evils.</p>

<p>Can you take your girlie in your arms now and hug her

<!-- page 204 -->

just as you could have done before she told you? If not,
then I had rather not be loved than to have it by concealing
anything.</p>

<p>You will understand how, after such experiences as
these, the things most women fret and worry over look
trifling to me.</p>

<p class="right">As ever, &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Just think of it, please; think how this woman
walked deliberately into what she had every reason to
expect would be a living death, upheld by the power
of unselfish love! She had lived a life of submissive
torture to meet a husband's demands, and not a penny
that she could call her own; had seen her babes die
because they had not vitality enough to live&mdash;she had
endured all this because she thought she must. She
had been free long enough to, in a measure, recover
her health, and for love's dear sake she could endure
for a short time what she had endured for years with
no such object in view; so she gave herself a willing
sacrifice, but found that even in a brothel a lover was
kinder than a husband.</p>

<p>If virtue means strength, she was the most virtuous
woman I ever knew. The sacrifice attributed
to Jesus is counted worthy of all honor, but I would
rather die his death than yield myself to the desire of
others and no response; but this was what she had experienced
in her married life and she did not know
there was anything else, did not suppose she could
ever feel pleasure in such connection; and yet, for
the love she bore her parents and her brother's wife
and babes she faced the ordeal.</p>

<p>I feel like saying in the words of the ancient writer:
"Many daughters have done virtuously but

<!-- page 205 -->

thou hast excelled them all." But mark: Going
there with such a purpose they could drag her down.
Even after the kinder treatment than her husband
had ever accorded her, had waked up her sex nature
she could not be dragged down. Winwood Reid
writes of the "Martyrdom of Man," who will write
"The Sacrifice of Woman?" She is evolving through
sacrifice, but when she comes to the front the altar of
sacrifice will then be consumed, for when woman is
fully free it will no longer be needed.</p>

<p>But I have not yet expressed the idea I wish to
convey. It is my full belief that women like the last
two named, women strong enough to hold their own
self-respect under such conditions, and at the same
time violate conventional morality with a purpose
for good, such women hold within themselves the
power to overcome a bad heredity that might otherwise
be inherited from the father. I believe that in
freedom all women will develop this power, and
through the action of this law all human needs will
disappear. Under such conditions "the son of the
bound woman" will, with all his imperfections, become
an extinct species.</p>

<p>A word right here, lest I be misunderstood. I
do not admire those women for <i>what</i> they did. Deception
and such a sex life are very far from my ideal;
but I <i>do</i> admire the motive which prompted them,
and the power of the love which, not only carried
them through but enabled them to maintain their self-respect
in so doing. Those women had, as it were,
to run the gauntlet, but they reached the goal unscathed.
They did what they did as one would wade

<!-- page 206 -->

through filth to save another. The power of their
souls was such that its living waters of love kept the
filth from them. Such love, when free, will so cleanse
away the filth, will put it forever out of existence.
Love is Life. Love is God. Love, creative love, is
the fountain of woman's power.</p>

<p>In a poem entitled "Love's Triumph," the following
lines occur:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Within the soul there is a fountain hid;
Whose waters have the power to make
The wounded spirit whole&mdash;
This, Love would reach: but if she find
That granite rocks o'er lie, and
Adamantine walls surround,
May she not drill and pierce,
And tear with shivering blast,
Those barriers hence?</p>

</div>

<p>The heart of woman is all right, all warm with
palpitating love, but it is walled around with conventionality,
is covered over with the rocks of the
false teaching which have made her a slave. Heavy
blows must be struck, these false ideas must be
drilled with sharp, diamond-pointed instruments.
Women who have not caught a ray of the coming
light, who have not felt its pulsings, will shriek out
with fear, but never mind, when the light comes all
will be well.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">WHAT IS "SOUND MORALITY?"</p>

</div>

<p>In The Arena of August 1895, the efforts being
made to raise "The age of consent" law, is called "a
battle for sound morality." Helen H. Gardener says
of this "consent" law:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>I shall not consider it in the usual way, that is to say,
as legislation <i>per se</i>, nor do I believe it wise or possible to
legislate morals into the people. * * * Now in regard to
unmarried motherhood, or prostitution outside of marriage,
the state has temporized with the abnormally developed sex
perversion and craving of the dominant sex, till the danger
to the state is very real and self-pervading; until famous
physicians, and alienists everywhere declare that not one
family in ten can show a clean heredity, free from the poison
of the vilest disease known to the race; until civilized:
countries are filled with epileptics, syphilitics, imbeciles,
sex-perverts and consumptives, and the insane asylums expand
in alarming proportions; until prisons are crowded
with criminals who are born with vice in their blood; until
paupers, the offspring of outcasts, burden the state and
curse they know not what.</p>

<p>It is notoriously true that brothels and vice factories
get their recruits from the ranks of childhood&mdash;from the
ignorance which is unprotected by law, and the state is
burdened with disease, and vice, and crime, and insanity,
which is transmitted and re-transmitted until its proportions

<!-- page 208 -->

appall those who understand. * * * In the interest
of public health and future generations it is of vast importance
to the state to protect the children in this matter.</p>

</div>

<p>I have quoted the above, first to show that what
an earnest admirer says of Mrs. Gardener's fearless
denunciation of wrong, is true, to-wit., she has not
thought "to the bottom of things," and next, to ask
her if she really believes it possible to thus protect our
young girls while the property system remains as it
is, and woman enslaved as now? She says she does
not believe that morals can be legislated into the people.
How, then?</p>

<p>It must be educated into the people, if at all, and
when the people are thus educated, so educated that
all the machinery of society is made subservient to
the needs of the people, then our young girls will
need no state protection, for they will not only know
how, but they will have the conditions needed to protect
themselves.</p>

<p>When it can be shown that the state has really
protected any class of people needing protection, then
I shall begin to believe that the state can really do
such work; not till then. The state protects itself by
making the people subservient, and while, at tremendous
cost to the people, it secures and punishes
a few law-breakers, it, by its attempts to enforce an
arbitrary morality, increases cunning and intrigue a
thousand fold, for people will not be forced into state
established morality; thus, these false methods of
restraint only increase the evils they are intended
to obviate.</p>

<p>"The state protect the children!" That's what Anthony

<!-- page 209 -->

Comstock claims to be doing, protects them by
keeping knowledge from them; knowledge that children
want, have a right to, and will have in some
shape. Such knowledge, that of sex, its uses and
abuses, if not openly and purely imparted, destroys
the basis of a sound morality, makes it next to impossible,
because of the false ideas covertly gathered.</p>

<p>The law is needed in the interest of public health,
it is claimed. Very well; but what is health but
morality? Whatever tends to the health of the individual
or of the public, is moral, no matter what it is.
Will those who are working to raise "the age of consent"
admit that? If a woman's health, or even her
life depended upon sex association and she dared to
hold such relation outside of wedlock, how many of
those women are there who have worked so earnestly
in this "age of consent" matter, who would not ostracise
her?</p>

<p>Take the demand made for woman that she
should be entirely free, coupled with the well sustained
statement that with such freedom, and all the institutions
of society adjusted thereto, that all this sex disease
with its train of epileptics, syphilitics, and all
the others named, would disappear, will any of those
women consider such a proposition for a moment?</p>

<p>What, woman free! woman dispose of her person
as she pleases! Yes, and with such freedom there
will be none but mutual and loving relations, and
harmony is health. What's the matter, my sisters,
are you afraid of yourselves? With all the conditions
of society adjusted to such freedom, with no pressure
upon you to yield yourselves against your own desire,

<!-- page 210 -->

are you afraid you would run wild, would abuse
yourselves?</p>

<p>No, this "age of consent" battle has not been a
battle for sound, but for false morality. They claim
to be trying to save young girls "From that which
they do not understand is in store for them, and from
the social degradation which is also inevitable, and as
cruel and relentless as the folds of a python."</p>

<p>Why not teach them to understand, and by being
just, destroy the python? "No woman is ruined unless
she thinks so." There is more help for woman
in those few words than in all the protection the state
can give. Such a spirit manifested by each and all
who have felt the injustice of our laws and social customs
in this respect, coupled with an intelligent and
independent judgment as to what sound morality is,
would soon cut the python in two.</p>

<p>"No woman is ruined unless she thinks so." Is
there any morality in that sort of pythonism which
will not let a woman rise because she has made a mistake,
or because it is thought she has?</p>

<p>Morality; in what does it consist? What is the
prevailing idea? Is it, does this or that harmonize
with my health and happiness and the well being of
my neighbor? Oh, no; but does some unseen personality
say we may or may not, or does the state say
we may or may not? Those who tell us of this unseen
personality, and assume his right to rule, know
no more of what he commands or forbids than we do,
and the state has no moral right to restrain us so long
as we injure no one.</p>

<p>The true standard of morality as to any act or

<!-- page 211 -->

course of action, rests upon its relation to, or effect
upon the health and happiness of ourselves and others.
That is, nature makes right action a blessing,
while wrong action brings pain; any statute or custom
which contravenes this natural law, is the result of
ignorance, tyrannical usurpation, or both, and no so-called
God is any more exempt from this indictment
than are human laws and governments.</p>

<p>Tried by this standard our sex morality is not
only utterly false but cruel. The following from the
little sheet called Lucifer, and whose editor is unjustly
imprisoned for the third time, is to the point. The
writer says in reference to this question of morality,</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Right acting in any important matter must be preceded
by right thinking and right planning, and if from our own
personal experience and that of others, as shown by the public
press, flooded as it is with results of extremest pain as to
sex we do not awake from the superstitions of our fathers
and say that while there may exist much that is wrong, there
is nothing that is obscene, our case is truly a hopeless one.</p>

<p>Our morality is a fabricated one and it rests only on a
base of sand. Based thus it always has tottered and fallen,
and is there any reason to suppose that methods of staying
it which ever have proved weak will begin now to be strong?</p>

<p>Banish from our minds the idea of obscenity, base morality
on hygiene and I know of nothing that can undermine it.</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, our morality is a fabricated one, but hygiene
cannot be a sound basis for it till the teachings are in
accord with what would be for our health under right
conditions, instead of being formulated, as is now too
often the case, from results that have come from false
conditions. Nature has no more use for an arbitrary
or uniform standard in hygiene than she has in the

<!-- page 212 -->

matter of sex. The same writer, speaking of the efforts
of a popular magazine in the direction of morality,
very truthfully says,</p>

<p class="small">Its chief mistake lies in its continued iteration as to
"virtue," "fallen women," etc., etc., showing that while
posing as a truth seeker, and a liberal it only accepts as
right such manifestations of sex attraction as take place inside
the marriage bond. If it held that such outside manifestation
would bring down on the parties to it onerous
pains and penalties, that would certainly be true. The distinction
which should be but is not made, is as to the unwarrantableness
of these same penalties. The outcry is
kept up as to the sin of the act rather than as to the sin of
the man made penalty, and in so doing, it places itself in
line with those whose mistaken course is ever to keep things
pure (?) as they were and are.</p>

<p>This is the same idea that I wish to express when
I ask: "Why not teach her to understand, and by being
just, destroy the python?" The question that is
now asked is: "Does society, does the accepted code
condemn?" The question asked by those who work
for Humanity should be: "Is society right, is the accepted
code of morality sound?" If not, it is the "python"
that should be attacked, and not these methods
by the means of which the unsuspecting are brought
within reach of its crushing folds.</p>

<p class="small">The state has temporized with the abnormally developed
sex perversion and cravings of the dominant sex until the
danger to the state and to society is very real and all-pervading.</p>

<p>Why Helen! you say that morals cannot be legislated
into the people, do you think that abnormality,
that of sex craving or of any other kind, can be
legislated out of people! If, in your "battle for sound

<!-- page 213 -->

morality" you expect the law to give you substantial
aid you are doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>"The state has temporized." etc. That is, the
very ones who are subject to this "abnormal" condition
have "temporized." It is a well known fact that
houses of prostitution in our capital cities reap their
largest harvests when Legislatures are in session.</p>

<p>Were not the futile efforts at reform with present
methods so pitiable, I should be amused at the ideas
advanced; but the most pitiable of all is the ignorance
manifested of the governing law of that most
potent of all forces&mdash;sex.</p>

<p>If morality cannot be legislated into the people
I again ask, how can a strong sexuality, abnormal or
otherwise, be legislated out of them? There has been
too much legislation in this direction already. It is
my honest opinion that were all laws in reference to
the matter abolished except such as protect woman
from forcible intrusion, things would be much better
than they now are, and with the freedom that
I demand for woman even that would not be needed.</p>

<p>One writer says that one great difficulty in keeping
girls from falling (?) is the fact that so many of
them are born of lust instead of love. Here are two
entirely unwarranted assumptions: First, that a woman
of strong passions is necessarily born of lust; secondly,
that being thus organized, if she refuses to
bear the torture of sex hunger and exercises that function
before the state says she may, she is, as a matter
of course, a fallen woman. What is this power that
thus claims dominion over both body and soul, and
how long are we going to submit to it?</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>That many are born of lust is sadly true, but educate
woman to her high prerogative, grant her self-ownership,
and how many children of lust would there
be? Not one, provided the institutions of society
were adjusted to such self-ownership. In fact, there
can be no true freedom for woman till institutions are
thus adjusted. But, if there are so many girls born
of lust what of the boys? The marriage bed in which
there is no reciprocity is where the children of lust
are begotten, children that are forever hungry for
what was lacking at conception.</p>

<p>Yes, those lust-born children are always hungry
for love, for something that does not form a part of
their heredity. The morality that so places woman
at man's mercy that she must yield when (as in the
case related in another chapter as taken from The Arena)
the man has so repelled her that his kisses were
a torture, such a morality, so far from being "sound"
is worse than the "filthy rags" spoken of in scripture.
Small pox rags wouldn't half describe it. That woman
whose husband's kisses had become disgusting,
hateful to her, did not seem to think it possible that
she could rebel. Oh, no. Had she refused "marital
duty" the law which is invoked to protect (?) young
girls but does not protect wives, would have given
him a divorce, and probably the child, while she would
have been thrust out from her home disgraced, if not
helpless; generally both. There is no morality in the
law or the system of society which makes woman dependent
upon the individual man, and thus subject to
his passions while raising children that the state will
claim when it needs them&mdash;for its own protection&mdash;.</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>"The nation that will not provide for its mothers
ought to perish," and it will, as have the nations of
the past unless there is speedy change in the status
of woman, of the mothers.</p>

<p>"A battle for sound morality." If people would
study this question instead of presuming to enforce,
or trying to, an arbitrary standard, they would know
that "lust born children" have a right to themselves,
would know that they must live their own lives, and
will rise through their own experiences if permitted
so to do, that the tendency of life is upward unless
crushed downward; studying this question free from
prejudice, they would no longer insist on conditions
which necessitate more or less children of lust, but
would secure to woman such freedom as would give
us only love children.</p>

<p>That would be "sound morality."</p>

<p>But now the standard demands of women so born
the same rule of action as of all others. Such must
endure the torture of an active, unsatisfied demand,
or violate the standard; if the latter, then church and
state combine to crucify them in the name of morality.
They, in turn visit innumerable evils upon society
not one of which need be if a "fabricated morality"
did not prevail. The world does not know because it
does not seek to know that an excess of sex life rightly
used, would evolve a spiritual element which would
supply that which was lacking till, through the law
of growth, all abnormality would cease. But with
present methods, the greater the effort made to suppress
that which seems abnormal in sex, the fiercer it
burns. It must be lived out. That which has been

<!-- page 216 -->

sown must be reaped. There is no other help for it.</p>

<p>Morality must be measured by conditions, by
needs and not by set rules. The following story was
told me by one who knew the facts. A young girl
living in the village where he resided was frail, sickly,
and none of the resident physicians could do her
any good. At length a magnetic healer came into the
place and under his treatment she became well and
strong. She married, and all was well till, by some
means it came out that the doctor who cured her had
used sex magnetism, and then&mdash;!</p>

<p>Well, the persecution was such the doctor had to
leave, and the girl and her husband went also, to escape
the ostracism that was meted out to them. The
girl had been cured; that was true; but the code had
been violated, and better she had died!!</p>

<p>Such is the verdict of what is called civilized society.
Such is the code of a morality based upon the
supposed, or perhaps real commands of some finite
being speaking as God; a code that obeyed often ends
in death, and if disobeyed, its ignorant, enslaved advocates
make conditions more bitter than death. If
hygiene be made the standard of a true morality, that
which is healthy being moral, then those persecuted
parties were far more moral than their persecutors.</p>

<p>The same is true of the mother and daughter
cured by the same man, as related in one the letters
of a former chapter. While confessing that I could
not so overcome both my inherited and my educational
repugnance as to do the same under similar circumstances,
still, if results were as stated by the writer,
they justify the course taken.</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>Sex relations, in and of themselves, have no
more character in the human than in plants
and animals. It is the estimate we place upon such
relations, and the conditions under which they are
held which decides their effects for good or evil.
Such as are not acceptable to both parties are always
immoral for they always generate discord and disease
in a greater or less degree. Also, if either party
fails to fully respect the other as an equal the relation
is an immoral one so far as that party is concerned.
Then if we violate our own moral sense it makes the
act immoral. An animal has no moral sense to violate
and the human who is merely animal belongs in
the same category.</p>

<p>But "right thinking must precede right acting."
If our moral sense has been wrongly educated we may
violate both physical and psychical law an yet feel no
guilt. A man feels no sense of moral wrong because
of holding sex relations with his wife even though
consent was wrung from her under pressure and the
consequences to her are pain and suffering, I mean a
man who measures his conduct by legal right. Neither
does the woman have a sense of moral wrong in
thus submitting against her own feelings. "Right
thinking," a right understanding of nature's laws as to
the need of reciprocity will change all this.</p>

<p>Again, the character of the sex act depends upon
the self-respecting purpose of the parties as much as
does any other act. I mean that the character of any
act not in and of itself either good or bad, is decided
by the motive that prompts it. If men and women
believe that law alone can sanction this relation but

<!-- page 218 -->

allow the strength of their passional nature to overcome
such belief, causes them to act contrary to their
honest convictions, no matter if such convictions are
erroneous, such men and women debase their moral
natures, but such debasement does not result from
the act but from the wrong thinking; and a large share
of the degradation arising from illegal sex relations
comes from this very fact, the wounded self-respect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those who honestly repudiate
external authority in sex matters, but who never violate
their best judgment, who are honest and truthful
to each other, who do not allow passion to rule at the
expense of justice&mdash;such people are not and cannot be
morally injured because of illegal association. In
the discussion over the age of consent laws which is
called "a battle for sound morality," J. E. Rowen,
senator from Iowa, says:</p>

<p class="small">The law permits a scoundrel matured in crime to rob a
mere child of her virtue, of that which is to her of priceless
value and by setting up the plea of 'consent' he escapes punishment
which every principle of equity should inflict upon
him. He goes free. What of his victim? <i>Her life is ruined</i>.</p>

<p>That such a man is destitute of any correct moral
sense, I will admit, but not more so than that system
of society which because of the wrong done to
that child, allows her to be ruined. The ruin results
from the social slavery which makes woman's person
property, which demands <i>legal</i> sale before use, and
such a standard is as far from "sound morality" as the
east is from the west.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the outcry that will be made
against the position I have taken, but if such freedom
and such adjustment of society as are here demanded

<!-- page 219 -->

can possibly make things worse than they now are
then it were better that the deluge become a fact of
the present instead of a legend of the past.</p>

<p>"Not one family in ten can show a clean heredity,
free from the poison of the vilest disease known to
the race." <i>Not one family in ten</i>, and serious, thinking
people trying to save a less than a tenth from becoming
contaminated by such means as <i>age of consent
laws!</i> The effort would indeed be laughable if it
were not so pitiable. And this is the result of your
present standard of legal morality! Is it not time
that the standard was questioned!</p>

<p>And as to attempting to correct the evils of prostitution
inside of the marriage bond, one might as
well have attempted to prevent the abuse of the slave-holder's
power inside of chattel slavery. As long as
that institution existed any interference between master
and slave was considered an impertinence. Just
so it is between husband and wife, and so it will be
so long as the wife is the husband's legal property.</p>

<p>The morality that makes woman's person subject
to outside authority is a "fabricated morality,"
and never, till woman is wholly free, will the blood of
the race be purged from the taint of "the vilest disease
known to humanity." A. C. Thompkins, representative
from Ky., tells one grand truth in his argument
against a change in the "consent" laws when
he says: "The experience of the entire world shows
that no amount of legislation can command sexual
morality." Permit me to add: The misdirected efforts
of the entire world show that we have not yet
learned what sexual morality is.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">THE OBSCENITY LAW.</p>

</div>

<p>Over the signature of "A Lawyer," a party who
writes against giving woman the ballot, makes the
following unconscious admission of the purpose of the
church in connection with marriage:</p>

<p class="small">It might be well to inquire why it was that the Catholic
church so early declared marriage to be a sacrament.
The facts of history during the Roman Republic and the
days of Caesar's, and the earlier years of the empire must
have been well known to Roman Catholic ecclesiastics who
have been always more or less politicians. They must have
studied the causes of the decline and fall of the republic,
and accepting fully the Biblical doctrine of marriage, they
at once saw the <i>vast power</i> and influence <i>which they and the
church herself could acquire</i> and wield through that principle
and law, if it were ever acknowledged to be correct, and
were accepted and obeyed. It gave to woman absolute
protection; she accepted it and obeyed the church. It restrained
the passions of man in public and private life
through the wife and mother, and consequently controlled
the husband; and he feared the church.</p>

<p>And they who rule in the church were <i>men</i>, the
same as in our Legislatures, and know how to sympathize
with man's passions, hence, the "absolute protection"
it gave to woman was from every other man

<!-- page 221 -->

but her husband, but he was the absolute owner of her
body, the one from whom there was no appeal only to
the church, which, while reprimanding abuse, still
enforced his claims. "He feareth the church." Fear
was and is relied on as the ruling power&mdash;the weapon
that personal authority always uses.</p>

<p>But when, years ago, I made the claim that so
long as the church rules sex she rules everything I
did not expect such confirmation from church quarters
as I have since had. "A Lawyer" sustains the
bible and tries to show from the bible what and where
woman's place is, predicts dire ruin to civilization (?)
if she is allowed to escape from it, and the Kentucky
legislator who claims that sex desire may be transformed
into religious emotion, practically says that
woman is safe under church influence and no where
else.</p>

<p>That the "obscenity law" is a church measure is
a well known fact, and that it was passed at the closing
session of a Congress whose record for drunken
debauchery at that session was widely commented by
the press is also a matter of history. Whether the
influence of church agents, in order to secure such a
law, had anything to do in bringing about that drunken
condition is open to grave suspicion.</p>

<p>One thing is certain. Its bitter enforcement
against so-called obscenity&mdash;against that which the
true purpose of a law against lascivious literature
would not touch unless there was a purpose
behind the prosecution other than that claimed, has
all along been manifest. Real obscenity, or such as
the law was pretendedly framed for, in many cases

<!-- page 222 -->

has been left untouched, while honest investigators
of sex law as existing in nature have been hurried to
prison.</p>

<p>The cases of Bennett and Heywood being hounded
to their death, are well known. That of Moses Harman
commenced with the marriage question. Anger
that he should sustain his daughter and her lover in
their declared right to themselves&mdash;anger because
their only marriage was self-marriage before witnesses,
and that not according to church or state
formula, caused the jailing of the parties and then a
searching of the paper which Mr. Walker (his daughter's
lover) and himself were publishing to see if they
could not find something to base a charge of obscenity
upon so as to imprison them. They selected
the following, known as</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">THE MARKLAND LETTER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eds. Lucifer:</span> To-day's mail brought me a letter from
a dear lady friend, from which I quote and query,</p>

<p>"About a year ago F&mdash;&mdash; gave birth to a babe, and
was severely torn by the use of instruments in incompetent
hands. She had gone through three operations and all
failed. I brought her home and had Drs. &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; to
operate on her and she was getting along nicely until last
night when her husband came down, forced himself into
her bed and the stitches were torn from her healing flesh,
leaving her in a worse condition than ever. I don't know
what to do."</p>

<p>Now, Searlites; "laws are made for the protection of
life, person and property."</p>

<p>Will you point to a law that will punish this brute?</p>

<p>Was his conduct illegal? The marriage license was a
permit of the people at large, given by their agent for this
man and woman&mdash;a mere child&mdash;to marry.</p>

<p>Marry for what? Business? That he may have a

<!-- page 223 -->

housekeeper? He could legally have hired her for that.
Save one thing, is there anything a man and woman can do
for each other which they may not legally do without
marrying?</p>

<p>Is not that one thing copulation? Does the law interfere
in any other relations of service between the sexes?</p>

<p>What is rape? Is it not coition by force, not having a
legal right?</p>

<p>Can there be legal rape? Did this man rape his wife?
Would it have been rape had he not been married to her?</p>

<p>Does the law protect the person of woman in marriage?
Does it protect her out of marriage?</p>

<p>Does not the question of rape turn on the pivot of legal
right regardless of consequences?</p>

<p>If a man stabs his wife to death with a knife does not
the law hold him for murder?</p>

<p>If he stabs her to death with his penis, what does the
law do?</p>

<p>If the wife, to protect her life, stabs her husband with
a knife, does the law hold her guiltless? Can a Czar have
more absolute power over a subject than a man has over
the genitals of his wife?</p>

<p>Is it not a fearful power? Would a kind, considerate
husband feel robbed, feel his manhood emasculated, if deprived
of this legal power?</p>

<p>Does the safety of society depend upon a legal right
which none but the coarse, selfish, ignorant, brutal will assert
and exercise?</p>

<p>If "marriage is a civil contract," has the female partner
a right to twenty-five dollars of the firm's money to purchase
the civil consent of a civilized (?) law, to a civilized
dissolution of said contract?</p>

<p>Why charge one dollar to get into the show and "twenty-five"
to get out? Why not reverse it?</p>

<p>Does "conjugal fidelity" depend upon "Be it enacted?"</p>

<p>Does chastity, love, truth, honor, justice, honesty,
purity depend upon "an act to define, regulate and enforce"
the said virtues?</p>

<!-- page 224 -->

<p>If "love be taken as the only guide there will be no
trouble," says A. J. S. Is there any necessity then, in such
cases, of a legal guide?</p>

<p>If the legal bond is recognized, is love the only bond?
("guide.")</p>

<p>Is not consistency a jewel, competency another, truthfulness
another, honesty another?</p>

<p>Is a person whose moral horizon is bounded by statute
law, a safe citizen, entitled to confidence in preserving the
aforesaid jewels?</p>

<p>Has freedom gender?</p>

<p>Will some archist or semi-archist please tell the mother
quoted above "what to do?"</p>

<p class="right">W. G. <span class="smcap">Markland</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>And for publishing this letter, this evidence of
what the law allows&mdash;yes, the <span class="smcap">law</span> allows, for the
law dictionary says there can be no rape in marriage,
"once consent, always consent," for this, Moses Harman,
a kind husband and father, a good neighbor and
citizen, a gentleman, a scholar&mdash;a man against whose
personal character nothing has been or can be said&mdash;for
this Moses Harman spends his 65th birthday in
prison, and is there at this writing&mdash;Dec. 27&mdash;95!!!</p>

<p>That letter&mdash;oh, yes! It tells of a horrible marital
outrage; it portrays the status of woman in marriage,
and&mdash;well&mdash;it really gives the name of that
organ without the use of which the world would become
depopulated&mdash;without the possession of which
no one can vote&mdash;it is the voting qualification&mdash;gives,
all else being equal, eligibility to the presidential
chair&mdash;oh, crime of crimes to name it, and protest
against its being used to "stab a woman to death!"
Why, God Almighty made woman on purpose for
its use! That is the bible version plainly put, and

<!-- page 225 -->

marriage was established to protect it in its rights.</p>

<p>Oh, it <i>is</i> terrible to call things by their right
name, but still, it must be done. The pollutions and
abuses of the very fountain of life cannot always remain
hidden. There are fearless souls to-day as well
as in the past. Mr. Harman so far from being intimidated
published another letter, one from a physician,
published it to show that there was need of
just such investigation, need to call attention to the
abuses of the source of human life. I have not a
copy of what is called</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">THE O'NEIL LETTER</p>

</div>

<p>but I find in "Lucifer" of date Aug. 5&mdash;92, what will
give some idea of its nature:</p>

<p>"Our readers will please remember that it is the
O'Neil letter for the publishing of which Mr. Harman
is now in prison. The following from Monmouth,
Ill., date July 25, will show that there is need
of such revelations. Comstock and his clique are
doing what the ostrich is said to do, are hiding their
heads in the sand and imagining they are covered, or
rather, they seem to think hiding is the best way to
do&mdash;that if a vice, a crime is kept out of sight, it is
all right, so these terrible perversions of sexual life
can go on, and if found out, the party can be ostracised,
but the crime must not be described in order
that the young may be warned, and if one ventures to
attempt such a thing prison is the result. The lady
refers to the outrage upon community July 25, but if
her husband had not forgotten the envelopes, I
should not have had what was written the next day.
This is the second case of the kind that has come to
my knowledge since the O'Neil letter was published.
Read the extract from our correspondent's letter,
then I have something more to say:"</p>

<!-- page 226 -->

<div class="small">

<p>I cannot say that I see through all the difficulties connected
with the marriage relation, but one thing is certain;
all reform inheres in sex reform, for we are what organization
makes us mainly. If I had time I think I would
write you concerning a terrible outrage committed against
this community by a man who stood high in public esteem,
but time presses.</p>

<p>July 26:&mdash;As Mr. Wilson has forgotten the envelopes
(we live in the country) I might as well state the matter
concerning the man referred to in yesterday's writing. I
scarcely know how to begin, suffice it to say that said person
was notified that it would be very much to his advantage
to leave Monmouth at his earliest convenience, owing
to the fact that he had been corrupting the morals of several
boys in this city, by performing for them the work which
you once said was called French tasting. He is enjoying
freedom somewhere, but Bro. Harman who has made up
his mind to expose such vileness languishes in prison.
Oh Justice, where art thou! It is not to be presumed for
one moment that subscribers to <span class="smcap">Lucifer</span> read the statements
published therein because they enjoy such reading
for it certainly causes much pain to every sensitive nature
to know that our unfortunate fellow-beings are living on so
degraded a plane, but we do know it, and now the question
is, what are we going to do about it? Just simply fold our
arms and lay back, waiting for the world to grow better
without putting forth any effort to make it better? No!
ten thousand times No!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Anna Wilson</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"And now, mothers, what do you think? Perhaps
you do not yet understand? I was a grandmother
before I heard of such a thing, and then only a plain
statement could have made me comprehend the horrible
fact, and for fifteen years I could not name it,
even to a woman, but as I grow older I begin to see
that silence is criminal.</p>

<p>"Human-<i>germ</i> cannibals; a worse cannibalism than
the savages are guilty of-what do I mean? An egg
is the germ of a future chicken.</p>

<!-- page 227 -->

<p>"Did you ever dream that there are men who
have a passion for human-germs, and that to obtain
them they will take the most sacred portion of the
bodies of our sons into their mouths, and by the
warmth stimulate to unnatural action the sex life?
This told in plain terms is the "obscenity" (?) of the
O'Neil letter; it is for trying to save our sons from
such 'sex-maniacs' by raising the note of warning
that Moses Harman is now in prison. Were it my
son, I would rather a man would murder him and
drink his blood, than to pervert and destroy his manhood
in that way, and yet that man 'standing high in
community' is simply warned to leave town, is free
to practice his mania in some other community, but
Moses Harman is in prison.</p>

<p>"It is 'obscene' to open up to the world the vileness
of sex perversion&mdash;to open it up for the purpose
of pointing out the dangers to which our children are
liable! Cover it up! <i>Cover it up!</i> <span class="smcap">Cover it up!</span>
Yes, hide these results of masculine lordship and woman's
subjection! It is no wonder that you are
ashamed of them! But, nevertheless the work will go
on. You can stop the stars in their courses easier
than you can turn the wheels of evolution backward.
The clock of time has struck the hour for investigating
the laws of sex life, and no amount of outcry
will prevent it."</p>

<p>As has been said, Mr. Harman did not publish
the O'Neil letter to show defiance to the law, but to
show that just such investigation was needed. He
had not yet caught sight of the idea that the very
power of the church-<i>personal</i>-authority-God, with
all the emoluments that thus accrue to the church as
his representative, all <i>depended</i> upon the continued
enslavement of woman and such <i>perversion</i> of sex as
will prevent its higher uses.</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>He honestly thought that he had only to show
the need of such investigation for the good of <i>Humanity</i>
and he would be justified in what he had done,
but Humanity has no show in this battle. Among
other statements made in that letter was the story of
a family&mdash;father and sons, who were human-germ
cannibals and furnished each other with the unnatural
stimulant. As to the other statements of that letter,
the following from one who is well known as a thinker,
and published in the same number of Lucifer as
the above will give some idea of the balance of the</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">O'NEIL LETTER.</p>

<p>I have already quoted in my second number the general
statements of the O'Neil letter, that the "brutal outrage
recorded in the Markland letter is not at all uncommon,"
and that "thousands of women are killed every year
by sexual excesses forced on them." But it is not the way
cases are tried in the courts, to make general statements
without going into details. In a murder case a witness
goes upon the stand and swears: "I heard the prisoner
tell the dead man that he was going to kill him, and I saw
him immediately fire the shot that killed him." Is not that
enough, if it is true, to prove murder? But a witness
knowing so much about the matter, would hardly be allowed
to leave the witness stand without an hour's examination,
to obtain from him every detail that he had observed.
Men so often make general statements which they
cannot substantiate, that the evidence is not satisfactory
unless there are enough details given to prove that there
are no mistakes and no exaggeration. Dr. O'Neil, after
nineteen years' experience as a physician, was not so ignorant
of the requirements of legal evidence, as to stop
with his general statements, but he fortified them by individual
cases. He mentions Mrs. M., who had already died,
Mrs. D., Mrs. B., Mrs. O. M. V., now dying, and Mrs.

<!-- page 229 -->

N&mdash;n, now in the mad-house, all from the same cause; and
he refers to many others whom he does not name. And all
this is within the experience of a single physician. Is there
not sufficient evidence here of a "great, flagrant wrong?"
When a single physician comes forward with so many cases
with regard to which he can give upon the witness stand
every fact required, so far as allowed by the law with regard
to privileged communications, it is manifest that it is
no exaggeration to say that "thousands of women are killed
every year" by similar causes. And yet it is for printing
and mailing the letter in which these revelations are made,
not only to protect himself from being consigned to the
penitentiary for falsely making such accusations, but to enlist
public sentiment and arouse such indignation in the
public mind as will sweep from the statute book the authority
now given to commit such outrages, it is for this
attempt to waken the public conscience and to blot out a
national disgrace, that <i>Moses Harman is in prison</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>There is so much that could be given to show
the need of opening up this question of questions,
one knows hardly which to select. But that these abnormal
manifestations are the results of the obstructed
normal expression of sex is too evident to the
thinking mind to be questioned, and that we should
first so understand as to know what is normal, and
then see to it that it is not obstructed, is, or should
be self-evident to every careful thinker who has no
preconceived theory to sustain.</p>

<p>Woman is the most important factor in the evolution
of the race because of the fact that it marches
into this life under her beating heart, and her feelings
of hope, fear, aspiration, anger, love or hate are woven
into its very life. The race can never be <span class="smcap">free</span> so
long as she is a <i>subject</i>, but that she be subject as to

<!-- page 230 -->

sex&mdash;that she should have children forced upon her
because of such subjection is enough to clothe angelic
spirits in the garb of demons were they obliged to be
born into this life under such conditions.</p>

<p>The following, which was first published in a
little paper edited by Helen Wilmans, gives a glimpse
of what thousands of women feel but have not dared
to say. It is headed:</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">AN AWFUL LETTER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Wilmans:&mdash;</span>I feel that you are the true
friend of woman, and so I venture to write to you. I do
not know that any good can come of it, but it seems as if I
must write to save myself from insanity. I live on a farm
and I am not able to keep a hired girl. I have five children,
the oldest eight years old, the youngest sixteen months.</p>

<p>There would have been one still younger but for my
own murderous act. I was so weak and miserable and had
to work so hard that I just implored my husband to keep
me from having another. He is kind to me in the main,
but will make no sacrifice for me to keep me from having
children. When I knew this last one would come, I was
wild. Oh! it seemed as if I would rather die a thousand
times, than have an another. I believe my soul did desert
me for a time and I left home, scouring the country on foot
and bareheaded, for days. At last I tried desperate remedies
to kill the unborn child, and succeeded at the risk of
my life. But I did not care for my life. I did not care for
the thought that my children would be motherless. I had
just one desperate desire resting upon me like a pall. I
could not see a ray of light or hope. There was the eternal
round of duties; no rest for the body or mind. There was
the unending sickness that precedes birth, and the heavy
dragging at back and brain. Life was nothing but an acute
consciousness of imposition and cruel wrong. I turned
away from thoughts of prayer with a mental curse upon

<!-- page 231 -->

God for making men the lustful creatures they are, and
creating women as the tortured receptacles of their lusts.</p>

<p>I want to leave my husband, I am free now. I have
killed that last child. I have no more remorse than if 1
had killed a worm. I hated my husband so while bearing
it that I wanted to murder him. Why, I tell you, Mrs.
Wilmans, though he is a good man, there has not been a
day in five years that I would not have felt it a glorious relief
to have him brought home to me dead. He is a reckless
horse-back rider. Whenever he goes off in the morning
on some half broke colt, my mind will run all day on
the prospect of his being brought home dead. Yet he is
good, and so fine looking. He has never spoken a cross
word to me. Oh! how I could love him, and how proud I
could be of him if he only protected me from the result of
his lust, I have thought deeply on this subject while
dragging about doing my work, that love is one thing and
lust another.</p>

<p>The man that loves his wife as her heart demands will
protect her from his lusts and not let them poison her life and
ruin her happiness. I have one little girl. When she was
born, and they told me it was a girl, I shrieked in terror
and dreadful foreboding for her. I held her in my arms
night after night, perfectly sleepless, praying for God to
take her. I worshipped the little angel, and this was the
best my heart could ask for her.</p>

<p>Now, I do not want you to hate me: I know I am
dreadful wicked but I am on the verge of suicide or insanity,
for I am sure to be in the condition again from
which I risked my life to get free, and I cannot stand it. I
know other women as bad as I am in this matter. They
are good religious women in everything else. I have talked
with others and hardly one of them who would not gladly
be free from her awful position even if it was the angel of
death that set her free.</p>

<p>You heard about that woman who killed her three
little girls but saved the boy. I lived in California then

<!-- page 232 -->

and was present at the trial. She confessed to poisoning
them and her only plea was, "<span class="smcap">They was gals, Judge;
don't ye understand? they was gals</span>" Only the
women in that court room understood her defense, and it
was heart-rending to hear them sob and shriek low, kind of
under their breath. The men sat as cool as stones, and
judged her and condemned her to death; but the law was
saved the expense of strangling its wretched victim, for she
died two weeks later in giving birth to a human monster
that was buried with her.</p>

<p>Oh, my God! how long will we poor wives have to bear
so much? Is there no redress for us? Do you know of any
appliance that will prevent conception? I have heard of
such things. If there is anything reliable you have saved
my life by telling me of it. I got one of your papers. I
read it over and over again, like the Bible. It seemed as if
it revealed a pitying mother-God who would take us from
under the torture of the father-God's cruel law. I know
this is blasphemous, but I am desperate and I cannot help
it. I will pray for forgiveness when my reprieve comes. I
cannot pray now.</p>

<p class="right">G. M. L., <i>Woman's World</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That letter does indeed present an "awful" picture
of domestic misery, and if it was an isolated case
or the ravings of a diseased brain, it would be quite a
different matter but there is every reason to believe
that a great many wives are as badly situated, or
even worse. Cases have come to my knowledge
where, after travail pains had commenced, the husband
refused to go for the doctor till he had sexual
satisfaction, and in one case, a personal friend, an intelligent
girl was in travail, not yet having assumed
the marriage bond, and the doctor proposed connection
with her as a means of making birth easier.</p>

<p>Women are taught that it is a shame to them to

<!-- page 233 -->

tell these things, so they are silent or only whisper
their woes into the ears of some sympathizing friend.
One well authenticated case of the horror of a woman's
being subject to a sex maniac came to my knowledge
in connection with the publication of the O'Neil
letter, a case in which, when the wife's condition was
such that she could no longer endure the infliction of
his passion he forced himself upon her unnaturally.</p>

<p>I was staying at the time with one of the sweetest
women I ever met. Just before we sat down to
dinner a boarder brought in Lucifer. It was always
read the first thing. For some reason we had missed
the copy containing the O'Neil letter but had heard of
it and were anxious for the news, so one of us read
aloud an article which spoke of that letter in a way
that gave us to understand its nature. I noticed the
lady of the house ate no dinner, and after the others
had gone she told me the story of which I have just
spoken, said the article read so reminded her of it she
could not eat. Why, she continued, the babe from
the time it was born would gag if they attempted to
put anything into its mouth. They could not get
enough down it to keep it alive. She did not say if
the mother lived and I did not think to ask.</p>

<p>What a picture of domestic&mdash;no, I will not say
happiness even in sarcasm; the misery portrayed is
too vivid. It is such things as these that have come
to me unsought which have made me think, think,
think, even till I saw clearly that there was no help
under our marriage system&mdash;a system which makes
woman subject in the highest office of her being&mdash;till I
saw that this system, together with its twin barbarism

<!-- page 234 -->

our economic system, must go down, before the high
hopes of Humanity can be realized.</p>

<p>It has taken a great deal of study, a great deal
of questioning to enable me to plant my feet firmly
upon the rock of that truth which demands unqualified
freedom for woman as to her person, and that all the
institutions of society must be adjusted thereto, but I
am now there&mdash;and to stay. I wish I could make women
realize where marriage places them, and to help,
some of them at least, toward such realization I will
relate an occurrence of many years ago. I know it is
not exactly conventional to tell such things to the
public, but nature never hides her creative processes
from <i>nice</i> eyes and ears, any more than she "tempers
the winds to the shorn lamb" which was never yet
known to be done.</p>

<p>When I was about thirty years of age my husband
came in one day and said that Rose (our best
cow) was in heat but he had no time to go elsewhere
and thought he should turn our own animal in with
her if he was but a year old.</p>

<p>"Why," I exclaimed, "he is her own calf!" He
laughed at the idea of my thinking that could make
any difference with animals and proceeded to do as
he had said. Presently he called me to come and help
him corner the cow as she rebelled. I did not like to
go but knew he would be angry if I refused, so I did
what I have never thought of since without a sense of
degradation.</p>

<p>As to the poor animal, the expression of disgust
and resentment that pervaded, not only her face, but
the very attitude of her quivering body as she was

<!-- page 235 -->

thus forced to submit, stamped an ineffaceable picture
upon my memory. Of one thing I have always been
glad. So far as any profit to us was concerned nature
avenged her. She cast her calf before the time,
and was of but little use all that year.</p>

<p>Yes, I did what I have always regretted but, as
you see, I was cornered too. The man that the law
called my husband claimed the right to blame, to
make things exceedingly unpleasant if I refused to
aid him in outraging that poor animal's right to her
choice. This fact of the past illustrates the condition
of woman under our marriage and property systems.
She is owned. She may have a good, kind, loving
master, one who seldom or never makes her feel her
chains, or he may be all suavity before the contract is
sealed, but show the brute, the tyrant or both immediately
after, or he may develop these traits gradually,
but no matter how repulsive he becomes to her
as a husband, she is cornered.</p>

<p>Church and state form the fence corner; public
opinion, how to live, and what of her children? complete
the enclosure, and what shall she do! Had that
dumb animal understood her strength she could have
demolished the fence, or turned and trampled us if
we had not fled. Woman is beginning to sense her
power, and when she fully wakes up to the fact of
her inherent right to herself neither church nor state
can hold her, and whatever else is in the way of her
freedom will be forced to stand aside. Proper respect
will then be had for sex, and, as a result, all forms of
its abuse, obscenity laws with the rest, will disappear.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">MY OBJECT, AND MY ARREST.</p>

</div>

<p>In treating further of the "obscenity law" I wish
to state clearly my object in publishing the lawyer's
letter, for which I was arrested, indicted, and am under
bonds to appear for trial on charge of sending obscene
literature through the United States mails.</p>

<p>If there was some kind of machinery in operation
in connection with which thousands of men were
employed, but from some cause unknown, every now
and then there occurred a hiatus in the working of said
machinery by means of which an arm or a leg of a
worker was taken off, and parties should commence
studying and writing about this imperfection of said
machine with a view of remedying the defect, would
it be in order for the crippled ones in different parts
of the country to commence writing to said parties
presenting their own particular injuries and asking
what should be done in their cases, or for those who
had so far escaped to write for instructions as to how
they may continue to do so?</p>

<p>It certainly would not. The aforesaid parties are
not studying broken limbs, nor how to avoid danger.
They are studying how to do away with the danger,

<!-- page 237 -->

how to remedy the defect in the machine, and all attention
to personal matters hinders the real work.</p>

<p>That we have a great social machine which is defective
is self-evident, one that turns out multitudes
of maimed and broken lives, and that a very large
proportion of these wrecked lives are the results of
ignorance and misdirection in connection with sex
life is equally evident.</p>

<p>My object and that of my co-workers is to learn
the <i>why</i> of all this&mdash;to find the principles which, applied,
will prevent all social wrecking, and we cannot
stop to direct individual lives. The personal application
of said principles must be done by the parties
themselves. But notwithstanding, many people pour
the story of their wrecking into our ears, expecting
us to tell them what to do. We do not object to listening
to their sorrows, nor to the causes of their domestic
wreckage as far as they understand them.
We may thus gather lessons to aid our work, and we
can feel a sympathy that will stimulate to greater effort
in it, but when it comes to telling another what
to do when, at the very best, we can know the conditions
only in part, is a responsibility that, I at least,
cannot think of taking.</p>

<p>Again, there is another class who seem to think
that our demand for personal freedom as to the affections,
means license, means that kind of life which
knows little or nothing of affection, but is simply
pleasure seeking. They seem to think we are demanding
freedom that we may revel in sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>It was to oppose both of these ideas that I published
the letter which caused my arrest. I wanted

<!-- page 238 -->

to say to him and all others: "I give no advice and
write no private letters that I would not be willing
to see in public print." I wished to say to him, and
to every one who should read the letter, together with
my reply thus publicly given: "We do not study this
question of sex to see how much 'pleasure can be gotten
out of it' and escape the consequences, nor to encourage
double dealing. Stand by what you believe to
be right or let it alone. Be what you seem, what you
wish people to think you are. We are seeking for
the principles which applied, will do away with all
sex perversion; if you can help us here, all right, but
we have no time to attend to your personal matters."</p>

<p>Yes, we could have said all this without publishing
the letter, but not with as much effect, and I desired
to wrest some help for my work from that which
so annoyed me. I will now give</p>

<p class="small">THE LAWYER'S LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Waisbrooker</span>.</p>

<p>I enclose fifty cents for F. P. and want to submit
a question to you in confidence.</p>

<p>You have thought more than most of us and I want
your advice. Please give it on the other side of these sheets
so that I can show my letter and your advice to the other
party interested and there be no mistake.</p>

<p>I am past middle age and am married to a woman who
has proven uncongenial and with whom I cannot cohabit. I
have not had connection with her for nearly ten years because
it was not pleasant nor agreeable. I have a lady friend
about thirty years old who has never been married and who
has been raised in the orthodox belief of marriage and
sexual relations. She has starved for sex food.</p>

<p>We have known each other for a long time and love each

<!-- page 239 -->

other dearly, but cannot openly express or show that love
because of the conditions of society. We have met a few
times clandestinely and enjoyed each other's society <i>very</i>
much. We have a few times not only experienced the benefit
of our sexual mingling as advocated by Diana, which we
both have read, but have had full and complete sexual enjoyment,
and it was perfect bliss for both, though snatched
with fear of discovery. But the ghost of early education
and prejudice haunts her, and she feels, at times at least,
that it is not right, and to continue it she will have to pretend
to be what she is not, and wants to cease having sexual
connection or even naked caressing as advocated by Diana,
because it "is not right."</p>

<p>I love her dearly and do not want to do that which will
cause her pain or regret, and yet we were made for each other
and for no other, and we need that exchange of sexual
vitality that can only be had by free and unrestricted intercourse
with her. I feel that I must have it and cannot have
it with any other but her, for such intercourse with one I
do not love depletes me. I do not want to urge her, or be
selfish. We could occasionally meet away from home for a
day or two and have free and unrestricted intercourse and
be mutually benefitted, and she would do so but for the
fear it was "wrong" and I might afterward think she
was "low" and she would be seeming what she was not.</p>

<p>I contend that our relations are and would be pure and
right according to the true law of nature, but do not want
to urge her to do a wrong. You are not interested as I am
and have given such things more attention than I have, so I
want to ask you what we shall do. Shall we quit and be as
passing friends, or shall we go on as we have started?</p>

<p>I shall never cohabit with my wife. I have good reason
for not doing so. I have tried to break up with my
friend and not desire her companionship and connection,
and in so doing have led her to think perhaps that I care
less for her than I do, but I cannot keep her from my mind
and wishes whether absent or present.</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>Before I knew her I was more restless than I now am,
but my desire now is to be true to her and do that which she
wishes, but I am very fond of caressing and exchange of
sexual magnetism. It does me good and I believe it will do
her good as it supplies that which her nature demands and
has not had. Will you kindly give me your advice plainly
and fully. Shall we continue to supply each other with the
sexual food our natures require, or shall we stop and go
back to the old way before we knew what life and love was?
I love her truly and desire only to do right by her.</p>

<p>She enjoys the new experience as much as any one can.
Please consider this strictly confidential.</p>

<p class="small">THE PUBLISHED REPLY.</p>

</div>

<p>What a sad condition! Love, longing and fear.
What is the matter, my good sir, that you cannot adjust
conditions so that you can fearlessly and openly
take your loved one by the hand in the face of the
whole world? Is it wise or just to "go on as you
have begun," thus violating her sense of right?
Should exposure follow, you, a man, can stand it, but
where would she be in the eyes of community! Do
you <i>love</i> her and yet would subject her, through her
love for you, to such a risk! If you cannot stand by
her now you could not then.</p>

<p>There is a principle involved in this matter others
suffer in like manner. Their numbers are myriad,
and it will take brave souls to strike off their
chains. Do you want to secure the pleasure without
the risk? You are not worthy of a love, or an association
that you are not ready to defend. Come, now,
by the difficulties and heartache of your case, I ask, I
adjure you to stand up for your rights, and in doing
so, help to pave the way for a freedom which will
permit of purity in love. Do this or accept your
lot as it is, and live true to it. You have no <i>wife</i>.
No law, no statute of man can make a woman your

<!-- page 241 -->

wife whose person you repel. Which will you do,
be brave, stand by your rights, or will you be a hypocrite,
a sneak?</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Now what is there in all this to indicate a character
so lost to all sense of right as to send out printed
matter the purpose of which is to corrupt the people
in the most vital functions of life? This is what I understand
the purpose of the law to be&mdash;to prevent, as
far as possible, the circulation of such books, pictures,
etc., as are calculated to mislead ignorance and stimulate
passion. My purpose is exactly in accord with
the law, only as to a difference of opinion as to methods.
It is education <i>vs</i>. repression.</p>

<p>But I want to analyze that reply a little. Some
have understood me to advise the man to defy the law
and live openly with the lady of his choice. I did not
mean that. I saw no reason, if what he said was true,
why he and his legal partner could not be divorced.
It would certainly be better for them both. Then I
thought of how many are similarly situated and it did
seem to me that if they would all be true to themselves
it would not take long to change all this for the
better, and made an appeal that I should have known
better than to have made to one who was so weak as
to ask the advice of a stranger in a matter like that.
The power to endure martyrdom comes from within
one's own soul, not from outward influence.</p>

<p>And now as to education <i>vs</i>. repression. The
protection of ignorance has proven to be no protection.
The knowledge of the natural use of the sex organs
cannot be kept from children and the question in
dispute is: Shall they be kept in ignorance as far as

<!-- page 242 -->

is possible, being left to learn what they can secretly,
or shall the subject be treated with the consideration
it deserves, the idea of filth being entirely eliminated,
while the dignity and glory of right use, and the terrible
evils of its abuse are openly and fully taught?
Which shall it be?</p>

<p>Upon the answer given depends much of the weal
or woe of future generations. Comstock, McAfee,
and Co., aided by the law, are determined upon suppression,
upon the covering up process. Even parents
must not be too scientifically explicit, must not
call to their aid pictured illustrations of propagative
use. That was one of the allegations against Mr. Heywood.
"He showed his children obscene pictures."
No pictured illustration in the hands of a parent, and
used to teach his children the importance and sacredness
of the creative act, is or can be obscene. The
trouble is we have been so badly born and so falsely
educated, that but few of us are pure enough to do so,
for unless we really feel this sacredness ourselves we
cannot impart that feeling to our children.</p>

<p>If the pictured illustration of an act is necessarily
obscene what must the act itself be? If the creative
act is of itself obscene, then we are all the result
of obscenity, and that which is born of obscenity is,
must be obscene. We are all in the same boat, and
what's to be done about it!</p>

<p>Were parents to fully instruct their children,
both verbally and by pictured illustrations, thus fortifying
them against the wiles of the siren and the seducer,
then the obscene picture vender's (obscene because
gotten up and scattered with lascivious intent)

<!-- page 243 -->

work would be gone, and with it the need for the law
<i>if</i> to prevent the circulation of such pictures and such
literature was the <i>real</i> object in securing said law.</p>

<p>I am told that said letter is not fit for children
to read. I did not send my paper to children, and if
a sample copy chanced to fall into the hands of a parent
who did not approve it could easily be destroyed,
while the fact that it was mailed to parents was proof
that I was not seeking to corrupt children. Another
point: children when not taught by those in charge,
get their knowledge from improper sources, and coin
their own words to express their meaning.</p>

<p>Nearly forty years ago I taught a country school
in a neighborhood where the children were somewhat
backward in book learning. I took a class in the alphabet
and brought them along to words of four letters
when one day we came to the word, snag, and to
my astonishment the boy to whom it came refused
to pronounce it, while many of the children in different
parts of the room tittered. Their looks and
manner helped me to understand the meaning they attached
to the harmless word and I talked to them as
I then best knew how.</p>

<p>Had the scientific name of the organ they used
that word to represent occurred in the order of their
lessons not a child in school would have hesitated to
pronounce it for they would not have known its meaning,
and but few comparatively speaking, of our men
and women know that Diana represents chastity, that
Dianism means magnetic exchange between the sexes
without coition. Children seldom hear the correct
names for sex and its relations, but coin words

<!-- page 244 -->

of their own or pick up the language of the street,
all of which should not be, and need not be were
the young openly and properly instructed on this as
upon other subjects; and the lack of such instruction
in the past gives us many a wrecked home to-day.
But, as the lawyer's letter is counted obscene, I
propose to analyze it somewhat.</p>

<p>"Married to a woman who has proven uncongenial
and with whom I cannot cohabit."</p>

<p>Nothing obscene in that plain statement of what
is true of many a couple, true as to the lack of conjugal
happiness, if not exactly in the same way.</p>

<p>Now there is a cause for this state of things, and if
human happiness is worth anything that cause should
be found and removed. But how can it be removed
unless investigated by talking, writing giving experiences,
comparing note, or whatever else tends to the
end sought. How can we reach the great public to
create a sentiment which will find, then take hold to
remove this cause of so much misery, unless our
work of agitation, of research, can be publicly done?</p>

<p>It might be well to hear that wife's story, to ask
that man how he came to enter into such a marital
relation&mdash;was the relation congenial at first&mdash;if not
what did he do, or what did she do to destroy that
congeniality? Such conditions freely investigated
might prevent a world of misery to the parties themselves,
and to coming generations. "Oh, but you
mustn't, its obscene!" is the cry raised.</p>

<p>But this lawyer has a lady friend who "has starved
for sex food." Well, what is there obscene in that
outspoken truth? Let the thousands of women living

<!-- page 245 -->

in isolation be encouraged to tell the truth and
see what they would say. May we not tell the truth
that we may find the equalizing law which will do
away with this "starved" condition, in both sexes,
without any violation of the law of purity?</p>

<p>"We have a few times experienced the benefit,"
etc. "We were made for each other and for no other,
and we need that exchange of sexual vitality which
can only be had by unrestricted intercourse," etc.</p>

<p>Well, what of all that? Is there, or is there not
a benefit in the mutual blending of sex magnetism.
If not why do physicians say what I once heard one,
a good, conscientious man, say to a frail, delicate lady:</p>

<p>"You would be better married," then, after a
pause as if weighing the import of his words, he added
slowly, "if you didn't have too much marriage."
Alas! he knew too well what a risk marriage is! Still,
that risk does not disprove the benefit to be received
from mutual, loving sex exchange; indeed, nature
would be infinitely false to bestow upon the sexes so
strong a desire for each other if there was not a mutual
blessing in such exchange. I find no obscenity in
the man's straight forward statements, but I do find
a picture of the conditions under which thousands,
yes, millions are suffering, and my heart aches when
I think of the misery and consequent demoralization
because thereof.</p>

<p>"I contend that our relations are and would be
pure and right according to the true law of nature."</p>

<p>So says the lawyer, and so would I say but for
the deception, the fear, the underhanded planning
which generates just that kind of occult but potent

<!-- page 246 -->

force, even till the whole mental atmosphere becomes
a reservoir for the elements on which cowardice and
treachery feed, this till truth and honor disappear.</p>

<p>"She enjoys the new experience," etc. In this
sentence it seemed to me he was trying to give the
strongest possible reason to win from me the advice
he wished. It was as if he had said: "Can't you see
how necessary we are to each other? Can't you see
the difference between a woman sexually dead and
one who is alive!"</p>

<p>Yes, men like reciprocity, and did they know how
to use creative life, how to treat women rightly, or
were not men and women both so ignorant as to destroy
their marital happiness, men need not suffer for
lack of such response as would satisfy the hunger of
their now starved souls or astral bodies; starved till
they think and live obscenely, but it must be covered
up, kept secret, then no harm will be done.</p>

<p>Can foetid cellars be kept from permeating and
poisoning the atmosphere because shut from the light?</p>

<p>Your health inspectors, those whose work it is
to keep things physically clean, will find such places
and demand that they be cleansed, even if one does
have to close the nostrils to exclude the stench. But
our moral inspectors will not permit us to turn our
light upon the great, filthy moral cellar that underlies
the structure called society. They would preserve
the morals of the young by keeping this mass of corruption
out of sight. Oh, alas for the blindness that
refuses to investigate this most vital of all questions!</p>

<p>Because of lack of knowledge here the land is
filled with sexual abortions&mdash;half&mdash;yes, less than half

<!-- page 247 -->

made up specimens of what should be a grand humanity&mdash;and
will be when sex law is rightly understood
and obeyed&mdash;when woman is the owner of <span class="smcap">herself</span>.
We shall then have no insane asylums filled with such
as cannot stand the strain of life's struggle&mdash;then we
shall have none born who are deaf, blind or idiotic,
and none will be found whom it will be necessary to
confine inside stone walls.</p>

<p>Yes, <i>I assert it</i>, and future generations will sustain
me; not one of these wrecks of society&mdash;not one
of those in the various asylums&mdash;not a criminal in
prison (or out) not one of them have been rightly conceived
and gestated. Indeed! none of us are a tithe of
what we might have been had the full tide of creative
life&mdash;of soul and spirit as well as of the flesh, entered
into that which gave us being here. Because of this
lack, because physical pleasure was the dominating
factor, we are all under the dominion of the flesh.</p>

<p>Painfully conscious of this&mdash;conscious of the poverty
of my own make up, with an unceasing heartache
for the imperfections of one who drew his life
from mine&mdash;now when the remembrance of my own
ignorance and its results stimulates me to do my utmost
to arouse people to the importance of this question
of questions, now when my head is whitening for
the tomb, I am arrested, am under bonds, am liable
to go to prison.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Much of what has been used in this chapter was
written soon after my arrest Aug, 2&mdash;94. The matter
is not yet settled (Jan. 6&mdash;96) and I am still under
bonds. What the outcome will be remains to be seen.</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>I would like to have those who read the offending
letter to write and tell me if they think it "too obscene
to be spread upon the records of the court."</p>

<p>Such is the charge recorded against me by the
Grand (?) Jury in the indictment in which I am
charged with sending obscene literature through the
U. S. mails. Twelve <i>men</i> (not a woman there) thus
state, the most of them, no doubt, young enough to
be my sons. Of the many letters I have received
from women in reference to this charge I select two;
one from a widely known and highly esteemed lady
older than myself, the other a middle aged lady, a
successful physician. In reply to the question the latter
asks I would say I know of no one here who
would do such a thing.</p>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. W:</span> It is a fearful thing to be clutched by
a government which assumes the garb of righteousness to

<p>I have taken F. P. from the beginning, have read it
thoroughly and was so obtuse I never thought there was
anything "obscene" in it, and cannot think what article it
was that could have so stirred the pure blood of the P. O.
officials who seem to be organized on entirely different principles
from other men.</p>

</div>

<p>Now what is the leading incentive to this persecution?
Do they believe me to be a lewd woman,
and that my object is to corrupt the people? They
know better. I find in "The Prodigal Daughter" by
Rachel Campbell, issued by "Our New Humanity"
Pub. Co., Topeka, Kan., a correct reply to my question
which I will quote here.</p>

<p class="small">It is not honest thought and honorable opposition with
which we have to deal. Organized oppression is well aware
of our aim and purpose to effectually overthrow and destroy
every form of tyranny and injustice, and to break every
yoke and fetter that cripples the growth and hinders the
happiness of humanity. The aristocracy of religion has
joined hands with the aristocracy of wealth and their united
powers are used to influence legislation and procure the
enactment of such laws as will enable them under the pretense
of guarding good morals, to persecute reformers, forbid
agitation, stifle inquiry, the more effectually to smother
all freedom either of thought, speech or action.</p>

<p>The above very clear indictment replies to my
question and applies to my case. I will now leave
what is personal to myself, which would have been
left out entirely but for what is due to history and to
show the real animus of the prosecution.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch21">

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">THE GREATEST OF ALL.</p>

</div>

<p>The greatest, the most important of all the reasons
to be given for the full emancipation of woman
is touched upon in the second chapter of this work,
but it needs further elaboration. So far as the logic
of facts and the inevitable results of natural law are
concerned, I have certainly given substantial evidence
in support of my claim for woman&mdash;for her right to
her own person under any and all circumstances; but
there is another and a still greater reason for making
this demand. This, as I have said, has already been
touched upon, but, though seeing clearly the law involved,
the depending result is so great, and language
so weak, I am almost overwhelmed by the thought
of the task before me.</p>

<p>The fact that with woman in full possession of
herself, sex disease would be unknown is justification
enough for the demand made, but when I tell
you that the redemption of our bodies and the final
resurrection of the so-called dead depends upon such
freedom you have a right to demand good and sufficient
reasons for such a statement.</p>

<p>I will try to give such; yet, but for the discoveries

<!-- page 251 -->

of modern science in the realm of the finer forces
of nature, no matter how clearly I might see this to
be true I could take no step to show it to others, for
I should have nothing to work with, no demonstrated
point from which to start to prove the unknown by
the known. But when it has been found that something
cannot come from nothing, that an idea must
have a root somewhere, that the finer, the invisible
forces are the most powerful, we then have a basis
for our reasoning.</p>

<p>Taking as a starting point the postulate that any
and all prevailing ideas, no matter how much perverted
in their application, or how much narrowed down
by our ignorance&mdash;taking the ground that they are all
rooted in truth, we are forced to conclude that there
is a meaning in that text of scripture which says:
"We wait for the redemption of our bodies." And
we must concede that the idea of a resurrection has
a basis in truth.</p>

<p>We find also in the light of modern research that
there is, there can be no such thing as miracle. It
follows then that the redemption and resurrection spoken
of must come through the action of natural law
if at all. We know too that if we understand a law
and apply its principles we command the result. We
have also another term, regeneration, to consider.</p>

<p>Before entering upon our direct line of argument
we will say that there are two distinct lines of thought
manifest in connection with the sentiment expressed
in the words: "Nearer, my God, to thee," one of
which is to grow away from earth and earth conditions,
and ascend to the realm of pure being&mdash;to be

<!-- page 252 -->

lost in God. With this class of thinkers the appetites,
passions, hopes, desires which naturally belong to this
state of existence must be held in check, subordinated,
crucified, in order to get nearer to the source of Being.
The idea of this class of thinkers is thus expressed
by a writer in the May Arena for 1895.</p>

<p>"Displacing a material with a spiritual consciousness
naturally ensures progress. It is practically the
Christ-mind in humanity."</p>

<p>The other idea would be expressed thus:</p>

<p>"<i>Permeating</i> a material with a spiritual consciousness
naturally assures progress. It is practically the
God-mind in Humanity."</p>

<p>It is to this idea that we owe the hope of conquering
death, the hope of perfected, of regenerated bodies,
of a perfected race.</p>

<p>The former idea stimulates to the effort to grow
toward the source of Being by climbing individually
up through and out of prevailing conditions. The
latter idea is to so change the conditions that the tabernacle
Being shall descend and dwell with us. As
I see things, the idea of displacing the material with
the spiritual is a mistaken one. It is the Christ idea
so far as crucifixion is concerned; but by displacing,
putting aside the human we do not redeem it from
corruption. We must let go of Christ and develop
God&mdash;within ourselves&mdash;must not think of displacing
the material to give place to spirit, but of permeating
and glorifying it in a perfect union.</p>

<p>In such union the veritable God-Man becomes a
reality, but if the material expression of human sex
life is repudiated to give place to spirit, then the human

<!-- page 253 -->

is practically castrated, is sacrificed to spirit&mdash;to
the divine, thus leaving no human agency through
which to create divinity on the human plane. When
we fail to connect sex with the spiritual we leave unconnected
the one link that can give us a Divine Humanity.
To attain to this demands creative power.</p>

<p>With these principles before us we will now see
if we can make our claim good&mdash;to-wit. that the redemption
of our bodies&mdash;their regeneration, and the
resurrection of the so-called dead depends upon the
full freedom of woman and an adaptation of all the
conditions of society to the highest use of such freedom;
and I will add: men can never be really free
till their mothers are.</p>

<p>Commencing with the word, regeneration, what
is its simplest, most natural meaning? To generate
over of course; to re-make, to re-build, to re-generate,
but how is this last to be done? Through the legitimate
action of natural law. There are no miracles.
How does generation come? By blending the sex life
of male and female. Can there be regenerating, generating
anew without uniting the same two elements
or forces that entered into generation? Certainly not,
but why need regenerating? Because that which gives
enduring power, the spiritual, entered into our generation
only as a negative factor&mdash;was not recognized.</p>

<p>In other words, the development of the race is,
and has been such that there was no receptivity for
the broader, higher life-force. We have not been
awake to such possibilities, therefore have not secreted
in the germ the elements of a perfect unfolding.
Again, not realizing that we had anything to do in the

<!-- page 254 -->

matter other than to follow blindly the reproductive
impulse and "take what God sent," we have made
no preparation for the best results, and seeing the imperfection,
disease and death that everywhere prevail,
have decided that this world is at best but "a vale of
tears," so, thinking to lay up "treasure in heaven"
we have been sending the best of ourselves to the unseen
life. No wonder that we need regenerating, making
over, but how is it to be done?</p>

<p>Christians claim that Jesus brought life and immortality
to light. If so, it was by indicating the possibility
of so perfecting body and soul as to put them
beyond the power of death, for long before his advent
all nations and tribes having any spiritual development
recognized continued life after the death of
the body. But, while this idea is really found in the
New Testament it has never been interpreted by the
principles of natural law. It is the fear of death that
we have tried to overcome, instead of death itself.</p>

<p>We have not recognized the creative fire of our
own lives as being fed from the flame of life eternal,
and thus the fountain from which to draw our most effectual
aid in overcoming inherited imperfection, but
have actually counted it impure, and by our thought
have made it so. The assumption is that Jesus lived
a celibate life. It is but an assumption. There is no
evidence in the record to that effect, and the fact that
nothing is said of his taking a wife does not prove
him a celibate. He was begotten outside of marriage
and if his father paid no attention to marriage why
should he? I am taking the record as it reads, not
vouching for its truthfulness, but if there is any truth

<!-- page 255 -->

in it he was loved by many women, and if he did not
in return, love some of them, as men love, he was
less (not more) than human.</p>

<p>Jesus gave a hint of the superiority of free, loving
relations to enslaved ones when he said, publicans and
harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you;
but, the question not what Jesus said, but what is the
law involved in regeneration? As a man thinketh so
is he, is the first principle to be thoroughly understood
in this matter. If men and women think they must
go to church to save their souls they will be quite likely
to go. If they think there is a devil to catch them
they are sure to be looking for one. If they think
hate and revenge, they will be quite likely to live
them. If they think they must prepare for death
they weave around themselves the atmosphere of
death, breathe it in from day to day.</p>

<p>In thinking sex low, what they create in its use
is low, and if it be other human beings, only through
suffering can they develop those higher qualities that
should have been theirs at birth, and then we, in our
ignorance of causes glorify suffering. Yes, low ideas
of sex create an atmosphere of degradation, because,
acting as a vibratory force upon the elements about
us, each well defined idea stamps its image upon our
individual spheres; thus low thoughts of our creative
life clothe us in their own likeness morally and spiritually,
and so far as the body we have inherited can
be thus changed, we take on their likeness physically.</p>

<p>We know what the race thought has been and is,
in connection with the body, know that it is and has,
been doomed to death. With the fountain of life under

<!-- page 256 -->

bonds, the mothers of the race in subjection and
the full belief that disease and death are inevitable,
how can we expect anything better than we have!</p>

<p>Our first step then, toward regeneration is a firm
belief in its possibility. We must turn our thought,
our whole mental attitude toward renewing life. The
next thing is an entire change in our estimate of sex.
It must no longer be to us an impure, a disgusting,
an "obscene" thing, but as pure and sweet as the lips
we love, as sacred as the sweet forms of our babies
that have been begotten in love, as holy as the memory
of a mother's love.</p>

<p>With such thoughts of sex, it can never be abused
to our degradation. With such thoughts of sex we
make its emanations creative of newer, purer life continually,
for not only in the close embrace, but in the
indirect exchange that is the result of our general social
life there will be <i>created</i> the elements of life in the
place of, as now, the elements of disease and death.</p>

<p>But in generation, the direct embrace is necessary,
what then of regeneration? It is continually
being demonstrated that the union of the two elements
in the germ will produce a new being, but we
have never dreamed that this life-force might be exchanged,
as it were, and each become to the other a
fountain of renewing life.</p>

<p>We are told that the sex life can be absorbed or
re-absorbed as brain and soul food. In absorption
that which would ripen as a germ is not secreted, and
when the will power succeeds in doing this, it is practically
unsexing one's self. In re-absorption after secretion
it <i>may</i> become <i>food</i> for the brain but not <i>creative</i>

<!-- page 257 -->

life. I say it may, not that it will or does thus
become brain food, for I am in doubt on this point.</p>

<p>I cannot see how matter, after being separated
from the general circulation, and thus <i>sexized</i>, can be
re-absorbed other than an element of discord, disease,
<i>unless</i> vitalized by the blending life of its opposite.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and right here is the pivot upon which the
question turns&mdash;<i>if it can</i> be thus vitalized and then
can be returned into the general circulation, it seems
to me that it would thus naturally become a regenerating
power, become the hidden manna of life. Such
exchange would not necessitate culminating waste; it
would be what is spoken of in scripture as, the seed
remaining with, or in us.</p>

<p>As I sense the power of the spiritual, sense what it
must be when blended in a complete union with matter
in the creative life of the human, I feel like saying:
This is the "mystery of godliness" or God-likeness
for which the whole creation groans and travails.</p>

<p>Now I want my readers to stop right here and
think&mdash;I want them to ask themselves if there can
come a complete union of spirit with matter other
than in the recognition of the spiritual in sex, thus
permitting spirit through creative agency to combine
with matter till the balance is attained, the at-one-ment
to which the ages have aspired, completed; and further,
as matter which is chemically antagonistic refuses
to blend though fused in the same crucible, I
would ask them to carefully consider the question as
to whether there can be such union in undesired human
sex relations as will help us to attain to a regenerated
life, and yet farther, if, with man's aggressive

<!-- page 258 -->

nature, it is possible for woman to avoid undesired,
or to obtain desired relations except in a very limited
degree, unless the conditions of the demand I make
are secured to her?</p>

<p>If the positions taken are correct, and I feel certain
they cannot be shown not to be, then the first
part of my claim is proven; regeneration does depend
upon the freedom of woman.</p>

<p>The next claim is that the resurrection of the so-called
dead depends upon woman's full freedom. The
redemption of our bodies from dissolution is included
in what has been said upon regeneration; their redemption
after dissolution is what is called the resurrection,
a re-clothing of the spirit in matter, not the
same atoms of matter, but the same in kind.</p>

<p>Now, right here I want to submit another proposition
to the reader. By what law are living bodies
formed? Is there, can there found in all the realms
of matter a body pervaded with life that sex has not
been the attracting power which drew from matter
the body which clothes that life?</p>

<p>If not, have we any reason to expect that there
ever will be a material body through which life can
manifest that has not sex as its central attracting
force? Again I would urge that there are no miracles,
that natural law or method governs all things,
and always. The conclusion then is legitimate; if
there is to be a resurrected body it must be the result
of a union of the same two forces which combined in
the formation of the first body. It will yet be found
that the bible will mean much more to us with a natural
than with a supernatural interpretation, that the

<!-- page 259 -->

researches of modern science among the finer forces
of nature lead to conclusions that are in harmony with
the cabalistic meaning of sex as expressed in that
book; thus that which was hidden is made known and
science becomes the real revelator.</p>

<p>"The redemption of our bodies." Why not? Is
nature, in the temporary materializations which occur,
making an effort in a direction she cannot go?
Are these manifestations the result of a sort of blind
man's bluff on the part of spirit clowns who are playing
with nature's forces for their own amusement?</p>

<p>No, they are the result of the earnest efforts of
a class of spirits who would master the secret of sex
and control matter at will. The sphere of the medium
is the matrix or womb; spiritualized sex aura the
condensing or attracting element that thus temporarily
assumes a material garb. Having accomplished
this much will they be likely to rest content without
further effort? Hardly. Having found what it is
that has aided them so far, they will demand whence
it comes, how produced and what hinders its perfection
and abundance? Spiritualized sex aura is of more
value in the evolutionary unfolding of the race than all
the gold and diamonds of earth, and to woman as a
manifestation of the Infinite Mother Soul, is given
the power to gestate and bring forth this potent aura
as far as she has the conditions, and the fullness of
conditions can only come with a fullness of freedom.</p>

<p>When, in freedom, our atmosphere becomes so
vitalized with spiritualized sex aura that materialization
can be perfected, the resurrection an achieved
act, then those to whom this earth belongs as a final

<!-- page 260 -->

possession can triumph over death and sing the conqueror's
song. Others may grow (?) away from matter
as fast as possible, and ascending to the realm of
pure being, rest there till the desire to return to a
sphere of action arouses them, when on some other
planet they may achieve an inheritance.</p>

<p>As to my last statement, there is of course, there
can be no proof other than as each soul senses for itself
the analogies of the universe, but that sex is creative
wherever the two elements or forces blend, be it
on the physical, intellectual or spiritual plane, a close
observer will readily see; and that the female is the
gestator of visible forms of life is unquestioned and
I see no reason why the law should change when it
comes to the finer forces eliminated by the invisible
blending of these universal life factors. It is also
an undisputed fact that antagonistic elements will not
blend no matter how close the contact.</p>

<p>It follows then that I have proven my claim, or,
that there is no such thing as regeneration, or as a
resurrection; for, if at all, sex must be their basis and
their actualization dependent upon that which woman
can gestate only in freedom.</p>

<p>But, if there is such a law of growth in sex, its
perversion is not only proportionally disastrous but a
natural result of ignorance and repression instead of
intelligent direction. To try and make clear the idea
I wish to express, I will relate a fact in connection
with the development of the Negro race. Our Kentucky
legislator in his article on "the age of consent"
law, as published in the "Arena" from which we have
before quoted, says that the Negro in his native state

<!-- page 261 -->

is not sensual, but on coming in contact with civilization
they become very much so.</p>

<p>Why? There is a cause for this change and what
is it? This increase of sex desire when brought in
contact with civilization has a meaning not even suspected
by those who do not recognize the fact that all
growth is rooted in sex. I do not mean the unfolding
of that which was combined in conception and gestation;
such unfolding needs only the conditions under
which the life was started. I mean growth toward a
higher grade of life. All such growth needs and must
gather, at least the sex aura of the higher grade.</p>

<p>The Negro in his native state is, comparatively
speaking, complete. The atmosphere in which he
moves contains that which corresponds to just what
he is and nothing more; but when he comes in contact
with civilization the sex emanations of a higher grade
of life fill the atmosphere he breathes, permeate his being,
but mark&mdash;if there was no latent element in his
nature in harmony with the higher grade, no power
of attaining to it, there would be no response in his
sex nature. Thus his susceptibility is really the measure
of his possibilities.</p>

<p>Of course he does not understand this, neither
does the white man, but if the latter will take a gauge
of those of that race who have become adjusted to
the higher level, I think he will find no more of the
sensual than before they came under the influence of
civilization, certainly not more than in the white race.</p>

<p>But suppose this race, so susceptible of cultivation,
had been thrown into this atmosphere of civilization
in a state of blindness; suppose them deaf also,

<!-- page 262 -->

would not the vibrations of this higher grade atmosphere
stir their sex natures all the same, and what
would be the natural result?</p>

<p>Right here a question: Does any one know of any
such sexual abnormalism among the lower races in
their natural state as is to be found with us? I have
never heard even a hint of such a thing as sodomy,
germ-cannibalism, or any other form of sex perversion
among them. Like the animals, they are natural
in their sex life, or at least I have yet to find evidence
to the contrary; but, if the Negro had been brought
in contact with civilization in the way I have supposed,
with no perception of from whence that which
so stirred him came, and no avenue of growth, I
opine it would not be long before such perversions,
and perhaps worse, would be developed.</p>

<p>Now, please mark the point: The white race
has come in contact with the atmosphere of a higher
growth. They feel the more intense vibrations of
that sphere of spirit life which, if permitted to blend
with our life-force, would take us into that higher
grade, but we, for the most part, are blind and deaf
to spiritual things; and yet, in the quickened vibrations
of the spiritual that "set the flesh on fire," we
struggle and stagger, "reel to and fro" with hunger
for that which will open up to us this higher life&mdash;yes&mdash;civilization
itself is reeling and staggering for
the want of its renewing power; still we know no
more what it means than the Negro knows what his
quickened sex life means, and yet the immeasurable
horror of the abnormal sex practices resulting
from ignorance and the maddening hunger of starving

<!-- page 263 -->

souls, are but the measure of its power for good when
rightly directed, which it never can be except in such
freedom for woman as I demand.</p>

<p>Thus, not only all that I have previously named,
but the fate of nations, the question as to whether
they shall continue to rise to a certain height and then
slip from the ladder of progress and go down as the
nations hitherto have done, or whether some one nation
shall be able to take the next step and go on,
thus opening the way for all others. All this depends
upon woman's sexual freedom. The nations
have gone as far as they can with man in the lead
and woman a sexual slave.</p>

<p>I know of no greater reasons that can be given
in behalf of woman's freedom than those already given.
If I did, I should try and present them, for the
travail of the ages is upon my soul.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">AN APPEAL TO WOMAN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Sisters:&mdash;</span>In making my appeal to you, it is
my wish first to strip off the glamour that is thrown
around us&mdash;to show just the position we occupy.</p>

<p>The biers of the dead are often covered with the
sweetest of flowers, but their fragrance does not bring
back to life the still forms lying beneath. We have
been adorned with the flowers of song and story but
such adornment does not break, it only hides our
chains. Born into these chains, grown under such
discipline as will fit us to them, many of us do not feel
their pressure more than we <i>think</i> is necessary for our
good, till we begin to grow from within instead of
being shaped from without, but still the hideous fact
remains that <i>as women</i> we are slaves.</p>

<p>It is true, as human beings irrespective of sex
we have many rights in common with men, rights
that <i>they</i> have secured to us, but when it comes to sex
we are slaves. Church and state own and dispose of
us through their agents the priest, the legislator, and
the judge. These three are the trinity that rule us
for the benefit of said owners. This trinity practically
says to us:</p>

<p>"You have no sex. It is not and never can be

<!-- page 265 -->

yours. It was created for our use and you but hold
it in trust. We decree it shall not be used only under
the legal conditions that we have made, for the good
of church and state demand such regulation. You
must first pledge your body to the use of some man
during life. This done, it is your wifely duty to submit
to the desires of your legal lord at all times; you
must bear all the children possible for your owners,
church and state. They will dispose of those children
as they see best, you have nothing to do with
that; it is yours to bear, and care for till wanted.</p>

<p>"If you are submissive in all this and teach your
daughters to be the same, then you will have the reward
of being called good and virtuous women, and a
good name is more precious than rubies. But if you
rebel, if you play the harlot&mdash;well&mdash;we will visit you,
we will crowd ourselves upon you, will shut you out
from all other means of support, will drink up your
life as fast as possible, then have your bodies carted
to the Potter's field."</p>

<p>Is not the picture true to nature&mdash;to the position
we occupy as women? I need not ask you if you have
thought upon this for I know that you have. You
dare not whisper your questionings, many of you,
but you have them all the same; and now, you who
dare read, you dare listen, ask me what you shall do.</p>

<p>It would be easier to tell you what not to do, but
permit me to ask what you are willing to pay for freedom?
Can you give up the reward of submission, of
slavery, "a character" from your masters? Are you
willing to accept self-approval in the place of a good
name from others if you can have but one? Until

<!-- page 266 -->

you can do this&mdash;until you are strong enough to take
and maintain your freedom you have not grown to a
fitness for it. Our first work then, is to learn our
own worth, to learn the value of self-approval.</p>

<p>A lady who was asked her views of the command
to love our neighbor as ourselves, replied:</p>

<p>"We have not half learned how to love ourselves
yet." It is equally true that we as women have not
yet half learned how to value ourselves. When we
do&mdash;when we demand and maintain our right to our
own bodies, we shall then command what we now
plead for, and concede our convictions to obtain,
to-wit., the respect, the approval of others.</p>

<p>Who are these who claim the right to control us?
The fruit of our bodies. Shall we then permit that
which has come forth from between our feet to rise
up and claim to be our head!</p>

<p>Again I ask: Who are these who claim the right
to make laws for us and then imprison us if we do not
interpret and obey from their standpoint? Our children,
every one of whom has nestled beneath some
woman's heart, has gathered body and brain from the
very fibres of her life. Yes, our children.</p>

<p>Why do they do so&mdash;these, our men-children?
Is it because they are naturally so very bad?</p>

<p>Oh, no; they have great, kind hearts, but their
heads are so out of tune, so filled with false ideas
(ours are not much better off) that their hearts have
little chance to act. No, they are not deliberately
bad, but they have been wrongly taught. In their
conflict with untamed nature it has taken physical
strength to overcome the obstacles with which they

<!-- page 267 -->

had to contend, so they deified a God of force, a personal
God who gave out commands which must be
obeyed or the consequences would be fearful.</p>

<p>Oh, no, don't condemn these our children, but
pity them that they are under the rule of force and
fear, for they have known no better way. The time
has come however, for us to teach them better,
and if we do not the blame is ours. They, our children,
cannot free us. We must free ourselves; and
they, seeing and feeling that our power is not of
force, nor of fear, but begotten of the spiritual and
born of love, will glory in their mothers.</p>

<p>The first thing then is a due appreciation of ourselves
as mothers of the race, of the scientific fact
that as we are intelligent, well situated and free, so
will the race be, that as we are antagonized, ruled,
wronged, outraged, dependent, submissive to wrong,
so will the race be. The crushed condition of millions
of our children, the cellars, the garrets, the rat-riddled
tenements they are forced to inhabit, the prisons,
the asylums, the many thousands of our daughters
who are disease contaminating and disease rotting
because not allowed the control of their own bodies&mdash;because
of the fact that as woman is&mdash;as she is free
or bound, so must the race be.</p>

<p>Right here I wish to emphasise the claim made
in the early part of this work, to-wit., if there was no
ownership of sex, if woman was free from all outside
pressure she would receive the sex embrace only when
desired, and from whom desired, hence there would
be no conflict of feeling, no conflict of sex life. All
would be harmony in the creative sphere, and, as harmony

<!-- page 268 -->

is health, there would be such thing known as
sex disease. Another claim&mdash;No child of an intelligent,
free, satisfied and happy mother will ever become a drunkard,
or a criminal in any true sense of
the term; neither will the children of such mothers
be born idiotic or become insane.</p>

<p>What we now have is but the natural result of
our enslaved condition as</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"We have sat unresisting&mdash;defenseless
Making the men of the world."</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, men are equipped for this life through us,
their bodies and brains are from us, and if inferior,
it is because we are held as inferior; are they discordant,
it is because the very air we breathe is filled with
the elements of discord, and so through all; we have
furnished the material from ourselves and the fruit
bears the character of what we have been forced to be.</p>

<p>We are not our very selves, never have been.
Look about you my sisters, and see what you can find
that bears the stamp of woman's individuality. Is it
religion? No; that is masculine, both man and God.
Is it morality? No; that is masculine, every plank
fitted to man's supremacy and personal God authority
backed by fear and force. Is it in government, commerce,
in any institution of human interest? No, no,
no. All is from man's standpoint and our opinion is
not even asked for. They have, in the name of God,
laid upon us commands that cannot be obeyed, then
preached total depravity, helplessness and Jesus.</p>

<p>They have given us a system of society that it is
impossible to harmonize, then attempted to enforce
their ideals with prison, torture, the hangman's rope

<!-- page 269 -->

and armies standing ready to deal in wholesale death.</p>

<p>And what is woman's part in all this? To cover
with flowers of tenderness and charity some of the
hideous features of man's attempt to serve heaven
with hell's weapons, of man's attempt to bring order
out of chaos with the motive powers of force and fear.
It never has been done; it never can be done, and woman
at the helm of such a system as we now have
would make worse work than man has done.</p>

<p>No, there is no part of our present system of society
that bears the impress of woman's individuality.
She is active, is becoming more so, but everywhere,
in all places, man either takes the lead or his
methods are copied. We have no organized body of
women working from methods of independent thinking.
They step into places that hitherto only man
has filled, but they adopt his methods, study his
books, or write books involving the same principles;
they do this and think they are making progress, but
in it all, they have not begun to look for themselves.</p>

<p>We have so long measured ourselves by man's
measure that the self-centered power of the true woman-soul
is as yet hidden. This we must find.</p>

<p>I am well aware it is no easy thing to step out
from inherited tendencies and educated methods and
think for one's self, but this is what we must do, and
it will take big thinking ere we can place ourselves
where we by right belong. Giving a little personal
experience to illustrate: I fairly trembled at what
seemed my own audacity when I gathered the courage
to declare that the same law which condemned a
Catholic for burning a Protestant, or a Protestant for

<!-- page 270 -->

hanging a Quaker condemned Elijah, the prophet of
the bible God, for his wholesale slaughter of the
prophets of Baal; but the principle was correctly applied.
Every question of right and wrong must be
decided upon its own merits. That which injures or
in any way wrongs another cannot be made right because
of any command coming from any God, or
from any government.</p>

<p>Judging by such a standard, is it right that man
should enslave woman as he does as to her sex? Supposing
the Jewish story of creation to be true, what
right has any God to create woman and then make
her subject to her sons, and the sex slave of her husband?
What does the law of heredity say of the natural result
of woman's submission?</p>

<p>Man's religion has put us, as mothers, in a dependent
position, thus making our sons the subservient
tools of those in power, ready, at their command
to shoot down a common brotherhood, filling
the land with widows and orphans? What for, why
such carnage? To preserve a nation's honor! Ah, a
duelist's code of honor! If our sons may not shoot
their own enemies, what right has government to demand
that they shoot its enemies? Oh, but England
will resume her old sway if we do not protect ourselves!
Not if the mothers there set themselves to
teaching their sons not to fight. War will never cease
till woman finds herself. The spiritual power of the
awakened woman-soul would quench the spirit of war
as water quenches fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Sisters:</span> let us call on this inner self-hood to
help us to examine every institution of society in the

<!-- page 271 -->

light of truth free from the bias of previous teaching
to find if there is any portion of the present system
based upon the principle of love. What do we find?
Force, force everywhere the ruling power; force imprisons,
maims, kills, while love stands by helplessly
weeping, and waiting if perchance she may soothe
the sufferers. Talk of Jesus on the cross, call out
the emotions to the utmost, thou masculine representative
of a masculine God and thou feminine reflection
of man, but know that your system of force is the
real, ever present cross on which the true Christ,
the true God-love&mdash;Mother love, is continually crucified,
and has been in all the past.</p>

<p>Now my sisters: in view of all this, in view of all
the efforts that have been, and are being made by
good men and women to remedy the evils of this system
based upon force and their utter failure, what shall
we do? Shall we struggle for place and power under
such a system&mdash;one in which one class can not be
bettered without injuring another class&mdash;one that can
not give us health without starving the doctors&mdash;that
cannot give us peace and order without starving the
lawyers&mdash;that cannot give to woman employment
without leaving men idle and converting them into
tramps&mdash;a system that, as a whole, cannot be made
better&mdash;shall we ask for the ballot, shall we struggle
for place and power under such a system, one that
holds the mothers of the race in subjection and robs
them of what should be theirs because of the importance
of their work, shall we continue to struggle
with the difficulties of such a system, or shall we repudiate
it and demand that life be based on love?</p>

<!-- page 272 -->

<p><span class="smcap">My sisters:</span> let us counsel together; let us unite
as a Loyal Sisterhood, loyal to ourselves, and to coming
generations. They are coming, coming from the
great unknown, and what reception shall they have?</p>

<p>Shall prisons open for them, shall asylums hide
their broken minds, shall cellars and garrets be their
shelter, or hunger drive them to desperation&mdash;shall
the Potter's field receive their abused and disease-rotted
bodies, shall grape-shot and cannon mow them
down like grass, or shall the hangman's rope choke
them out of life?</p>

<p>All this, and more, must be the fate of millions
of them unless we gestate a new system to take the
place of the one that now robs and ruins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My sisters:</span> what shall we do, rise to the dignity
of our work, or continue to occupy a place in the
social structure subservient to our sons? I for one,
demand for woman the right to her own body, and a
system of society based on love instead of force, and
now I will wait to hear from others.</p>
