<h2><i>THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER.</i></h2>

<p><i>An essay read before the New England Free Love League in
Science Hall, Boston, Feb. 1881,</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Rachel Campbell</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President, Gentlemen and Ladies:</span> Although this is a convention 
of the Free Love League, I do not propose to make Free Love
the subject of my remarks to-day. I believe I can better serve the sacred 
cause of Freedom by calling your attention to quite another matter.
The principles of Social Freedom have been, not only logically stated,
clearly defined and ably advocated many times at these conventions, but
every argument brought against us by honest opposition has been abundantly 
met and overthrown. So long as I felt that we were misunderstood, 
that truly good people, not quite comprehending the ethics of
Free Love, were sincere in the belief that the tendency of our doctrine
is to encourage sensualism, I was ever ready to define, to reason and to
explain, to go over the ground again and again, repeating, restating,
answering every possible objection and making our meaning clear. Now,
I think we are fully understood. There exists no necessity for further
explanation or repetition. It is not honest thought and honorable opposition 
with which we have to deal. Organized oppression is well aware
of our aim and purpose to effectually overthrow and destroy every form
of tyranny and injustice, and to break every yoke and fetter that cripples
the growth or hinders the happiness of humanity. The aristocracy of
religion has joined hands with the aristocracy of wealth and their united
powers are used to influence legislation and procure the enactment of
such laws as will enable them, under the pretense of guarding good morals, 
to persecute reformers, forbid agitation and stifle inquiry, the more
effectually to crush out and smother all freedom either of thought,
speech or action. Our enemies realize full well that institutions of tyranny 
and wrong grow weak in proportion to the growth of intelligence
among the people; hence it is, that heroic individuals, reformers, men
who hold the welfare of the race of more worth than personal safety, who
call liberal conventions, write and circulate liberal books, publish Free-thought 
papers, and otherwise devote themselves to the cause of the
common people, are slandered, arrested, fined, imprisoned,&mdash;anything to
insure their silence and thus prevent the spread of radical ideas.</p>

<!-- page 2 -->

<p>The leaders in this unholy warfare, waged against free speech and a
free press, are unscrupulous, designing men, who perpetrate wickedness
knowingly and from evil motives, but the multitude who follow them
and keep up the "hue and cry" of "obscenity," are not necessarily bad
people. They are rather those who, too indolent or too superstitious to
think for themselves, accept as truth the traditions of the Elders, and
believe in the divine origin of old customs and institutions. They are
taught to consider the copulative act as being all there is in the sexual
problem,&mdash;a surrender to a carnal appetite at best, but licensed and protected 
by monogamic marriage in the very best manner possible. They
believe that in some mysterious manner the marriage ceremony changes
a very vile and sinful act to a pure and sinless one. Just how this mysterious 
power operates in changing uncleanness to chastity, sin to righteousness, 
they are unable to say, but they accept it as emblematical of
the atoning power of the blood of Jesus which cleanses from all sin,&mdash;Christian 
marriage being symbolical of the Christian religion they would
no more dare to doubt the perfection of the one than the holiness of the
other.</p>

<p>So long as people are Christians, and believe in the deep sinfulness of
humanity, and that sexuality in the flesh is analogous to total depravity
in the spiritual nature, it is useless to expect from them a rational and
scientific consideration of the sex question. There are those however
who claim to be freethinkers, who repudiate Christianity utterly, who
believe the old tree of religious superstition is rotten, root and branch,
and yet, they are ready to stone us because we pronounce its fruit unwholesome. 
With one hand they smite the Christian Church and with
the other they defend an institution that symbolizes the Christian religion, 
and incarnates the very elements of tyranny and slavishness they
denounce and condemn. They laugh at the assumptions of Jehovah and
neglect to honor, worship, praise and glorify him forever and ever, amen,
because such slavish sycophancy is unbecoming the dignity of manhood;
but they can ape Jehovah in the role of husband and find the servile
submission of a wife charming and womanly.</p>

<p>It is for just this class of persons, those who can think and dare think,
but who don't think, that I have prepared the following pages. I wish
to call their attention to the actual condition of society here and now,
under our present social system which they seem to think furnishes the
only soil in which sexual virtue can grow and flourish. I propose to
point out to them the mouse in the social meal, and to ask in all candor
whether we are not paying for "virtue" more than it is worth?</p>

<p>I will not go into respectable homes to reveal the skeleton only half
hidden in family closets, nor tell the sad story of motherhood ground
to the dust under the misrule of masculine ignorance and usurpation.
Abler pens than mine are already busy with this part of the work, so I

<!-- page 3 -->

will turn my attention to that part of the social vineyard given over to
the growth of weeds and brambles. The bickering and strife, the misery 
and crime, the suicides and murders that grow out of marital infelicity, 
are bad enough in themselves to condemn the system that produces 
them, but they are only a part of the price paid for the maintenance 
of compulsory monogamy. Beyond and beneath all these the lurid
fires of illegal prostitution are kept continually burning.</p>

<p>The social question will never be understood in its wholeness until the
"social evil" receives its due share of inquiry and investigation. The
courtesan and the brothel are facts in our boasted civilization just as
real as our homes and firesides, and just as much a part of the woman
question. Just now, people are asking, what shall we do with our girls?
and the subject should enlist the careful thought of all, but it is equally
important that we ask ourselves, what have we done with our girls? not
the eminently good ones; not the well balanced and the strong ones, but
the wayward, the weak and the erring; those who have been too credulous 
or too loving; those who, from whatever cause, have failed to preserve 
a virtuous reputation,&mdash;in short, <i>what have we done with our
prodigal daughters?</i></p>

<p>We are told that society must protect itself, must shield its wives and
daughters from all dangerous, contaminating contact with those who are
fallen below the standard of sexual morality, and in various ways express
its high regard for the pure and chaste woman, and its deep abhorrence
for the frail and tarnished one. However pleasant it may be for men to
associate with immoral women at certain times, and in certain places, it
is essential to the preservation of purity in the home that the woman
they honor by the choice of wife should be pure and stainless. For this
reason our daughters are early taught to expect no mercy if they fail in
this direction and richly merit their fate when they disobey. They deserve 
no consideration whatever, but must be weeded out from among
women, branded with dishonor and driven into the streets in order that
the virtue and purity of other women may be more carefully preserved
and more safely protected.</p>

<p>It is not always necessary that a woman be convicted; it is often quite
enough if she be but suspected. The "unco guid" have a saying, which
they flippantly quote in affairs of this kind, something like this: when
the down is brushed off a peach it may as well be thrown into the basket
with the rotten ones; and this rule, with a very little malicious gossip is
enough to make "virtue" an uncertain possession at best. A woman
may be amiable, truthful and generous, but, however well endowed otherwise 
with womanly excellence, it will avail her nothing if convicted of
loving "not wisely, but too well." She is straightway banished from home
and friends, an abandoned outcast, too vile and abominable to breathe
the same air with virtuous women, all chance to live an honorable life

<!-- page 4 -->

denied her, her place is henceforth with the fallen, the infamous and the
outlawed. The door to honest industry is effectually barred against
her,&mdash;no one may walk with her, no one may talk with her, no one may
give her employment.</p>

<p>This is the verdict of society, and Mrs. Grundy is commissioned to execute 
the sentence. It is a work she especially delights in, and under
her watchful care, the "garden of girls" is very certain to be thoroughly
weeded. She may uproot and destroy a great many white ones, in her
zeal to get at the dark ones, but she will take good care that none with
spot or stain be allowed to escape.</p>

<p>According to statistics there are, in the various towns and cities in the
United States, five hundred thousand women who make sexual prostitution 
their regular business, and obtain a livelihood thereby. From the
same source we learn that the average length of a woman's life after entering 
upon this vocation is only five years; and as their numbers do not
grow less, even with this fearful death rate, the conclusion is forced upon 
us, that one hundred thousand new victims are added to the ranks
each year. According to time honored custom, these women are relegated 
to the bottomless pit of social perdition, a place, by the way, that
typifies the orthodox lake of fire and brimstone, and is always open to
receive such as have had the sentence, "depart ye cursed," pronounced
upon them by a Judge too holy to "look upon sin with the least degree
of allowance."</p>

<p>Not until we stop and think how many, units it takes to make up a
hundred thousand, and that each separate unit represents the broken life
and dishonored death of a homeless, abandoned woman, and then remember 
that this sum of misery is but a part of the tax annually paid for
"virtue," can we realize the price at which it is bought, and the prop on
which it rests. One hundred thousand girls, annually going out from
the homes where they have grown from infancy to womanhood,&mdash;somebody's 
daughters! somebody's sisters! driven forth to disgrace and
death, weeded out from among their sister women in order to make sure
of feminine "virtue" in society.</p>

<p>We can well remember the sorrow and anguish that filled our hearts
when civil war called for a "hundred thousand more" of our boys. How
sisters wept and mothers prayed as they took up their line of march for
Southern battle fields; and yet, however sad the fact of their going forth
from home and loved ones, to meet danger and perhaps death, may
seem, it is nothing in comparison with the downward march of their frail
and fallen sisters. The "boys in blue" enlisted at the call of duty and
patriotism, and felt the inspiration of a noble deed in every risk they
dared. They went, cheered by the loving sympathy and grateful admiration 
of their wives and mothers, sisters and sweethearts left at home.
Every mail carried to them letters of encouragement, bidding them be

<!-- page 5 -->

hopeful, and picturing a glad and triumphant return "when the cruel
war is over." At the worst it was honorable death they braved; but we
missed them from their accustomed places, and our hearts ached because
of their hardship and danger. Somehow we never wearied of talking
about them, praising their virtues and excusing their vices, until "even
their failings leaned to virtue's side." Then, how we mourned the dead!
Sorrow and mourning pervaded the entire community, and friends and
neighbors wept in sympathy with each stricken household. Tenderly,
tearfully we laid them away, while tolling bells and martial music pealed
forth in honor of the fallen soldier. "Our nation's dead," we call them,
because their lives were given in defense of our common country, with
its happy homes and pleasant firesides. It is not too much that a grateful 
people consecrate one day in the year to the work of keeping their
memory green, and their resting places decorated with flowers.</p>

<p>But to this other army of five hundred thousand girls, avowedly sacrificed 
to maintain purity in the home and monogamy in society, we give
shame instead of honor, scorn instead of admiration, and hatred instead
of gratitude. The hardships and horrors of their condition excite no
pity; no tears are shed for their sakes; hearts are flint and faces are
stony! Driven in disgrace from their homes, and passing out of sight
forever; suffering we know not what, and dying we care not how or
when,&mdash;all we have to say, is, that it isn't fashionable to speak of this
class of persons or feel any interest in them whatever. Those who claim
that we could not be happy in heaven, knowing that our friends were in
hell, must have failed to notice how cheerfully righteous (?) women turn
away from friends and sisters when guilt and shame overtake them.</p>

<p>The most blind and bigoted devotee of the Catholic Church, that ever
lived in old Spain, never gave up a friend to the Holy Inquisition more
readily and cheerfully than respectable families give their girls into the
hands of Madame Grundy. The mother forgets the babe she cradled so
lovingly in her bosom, and the father turns with curses from his door
the "wee girlie" that used to play and prattle about his knees.</p>

<p>We shudder with horror at the story of heathen mothers, throwing
their babes beneath the car of their idol, and then dragging its ponderous 
wheels over the mangled, bleeding bodies, but we have become so
accustomed to the idolatry of Christendom, that its actual horrors enacted 
here at home, in our very midst, hardly attract our attention. We
think it is well, and look on without compassion, while our Social Juggernaut 
crushes its murderous way, not over the helpless bodies of unconscious 
infants, but through the broken lives and quivering hearts of
tortured, suffering womanhood.</p>

<p>Is it not about time to pause for a moment, and consider whether we
are not paying too high a price for virtuous monogamy after all? Let
us examine our purchase a little and see if it is really worth this terrible

<!-- page 6 -->

waste of womanhood. I appreciate the worth of clean habits and pure
lives, and render due honor to every man and woman who live true to
their best and highest conception of sexual purity and truth; but cleanliness, 
fidelity and truth are not essential ingredients in the make up of
sexual virtue, as the term is commonly understood. A woman may possess 
all these qualities in unstinted measure, and yet lack "virtue," or,
she may be sadly deficient in all the nobler traits of character and be virtuous. 
Sexual attraction, natural, orderly, and obedient to the higher
law of love, is not virtue in the popular sense of the word. Fashionable,
respectable virtue is always of the feminine gender, and measured by the
legal standard. A woman, to be virtuous, must live a celibate or else
become a legal wife; something she cannot be without a personal surrender 
of herself into the keeping of a husband, and an agreement to serve
him sexually for the rest of her life according to the law of marriage,&mdash;a
law, by the way, so constructed and administered that there is no phase
of sexual abomination that may not be practiced with its full sanction.
It justifies mercenary marriage and gives a license for excess and debauchery. 
The most cruel outrage and abuse will receive its benediction 
if they bear the semblance of monogamy and the seal of law.</p>

<p>Let me give one example to show the peculiar character of this expensive 
sham, bowed down to and worshipped as sexual virtue. The coarsest, 
filthiest and most sensual animal in human form may associate with
a woman, so he be her husband, may treat her in the most shameful and
brutal manner that woman was ever treated by man, may infect her with
sexual disease until her whole system teems with rottenness without any
damage to her virtue. The marriage certificate does double duty; it is
at once his license and her shield of honor. Her health, her happiness,
and even her life may be destroyed, but her virtue is safe. On the other
hand, suppose a pair of young and ardent lovers reveling in the delicious 
rapture of love's young dream, no legal marriage unites them, but
being healthy and happy, and well endowed with the sexual imponderable, 
they find each other "just too sweet for anything," and drink of
"stolen waters," and what is the result? Well, nothing as far as the boy
is concerned; he isn't damaged any, but alas, for the girl! her virtue is
lost! she is fallen! dishonored! <i>ruined forever!</i></p>

<p>Seriously, friends, I ask again, does not what we call virtue cost more
than it is worth? Can we not conceive a higher law of sex union, a holier 
relationship between man and woman, than the one patterned after
the covenant between the Jewish God and his chosen people? A person
would be thought crazy who should seriously propose such a rule for
masculine virtue as the one by which women are measured. No one
thinks of separating the bad boy from his home and friends, thus shutting 
him away from all good influences. A boy sows his "wild oats," as
a matter of course, and then settles down into a sober industrious man,

<!-- page 7 -->

and becomes a good husband, a fond parent, and perhaps a distinguished
citizen; and there is no reason in nature, why the girl who was his partner 
in the wild oat business, should not become a good wife, a loving
mother, and a valued member of society. No good reason can be given
why the door of reform is ever held invitingly open for a boy, and bolted
and barred against a girl. Surely the old plan has been in operation a
sufficient length of time to be now judged by its works. We have faithfully 
tried the experiment for ages; have dealt kindly and charitably with
our prodigal sons, and harshly and cruelly with their wayward sisters;
now let us carefully compare the results, and see if we are acting wisely
in thus discriminating against our girls. No one supposes that women
would be any worse than men are if allowed the same freedom of action;
let us see how much better they are now. We will take women, choice
and select, after this process of weeding out the soiled ones has been going 
on for centuries, and weigh them against men as we find them now,
and see how they compare in regard to manly and womanly excellence.
Are women really any better than men after all? are they as a rule more
honorable and upright in their every day life? are they more truth-loving 
and truth-telling? are their friendships more tender and lasting? do
they rank very much higher than men in any quality that goes to make
up a noble character? Doubtless their sexual habits do come nearer to
the popular idea of virtue, but will this difference constitute a balance in
woman's favor sufficient to outweigh the sin and shame of five hundred
thousand girls abandoned to a life of infamy and disgrace?</p>

<p>Whoever begins to investigate the "social evil" will find a subject not
easily exhausted. It has more heads than the wonderful beast described
in St. John's Revelations, while its cancerous roots penetrate and poison
every department of social and domestic life. The full tariff for the protection 
of "virtue" is not paid when our girls are thus ruthlessly sacrificed. 
These five hundred thousand women, shut out from industrial
pursuits, and denied the chance to labor for their livelihood, are nevertheless 
housed and fed and clothed. For their support a sum of money
must come from some source, as large as would be required to maintain
a standing army of half a million soldiers. We hear very little grumbling, 
it is true, about the payment of this burdensome tax, but we know
it is paid all the same, and whether it be paid directly from the pockets of
the workingman, or indirectly, from the hands of the wealthy, we know
the whole burden rests perpetually on the shoulders of working men and
working women. Nor is this all: the outcast is still a woman, actuated
by the good and evil impulses that go to make up our human nature,
and does not patiently bear the cruel treatment she receives. Sneers
and taunts from happier women meet her whatever way she turns; and
envy and hatred beget in her a spirit of retaliation. Goaded by grief,
shame and indignation she becomes bitter and revengeful towards the

<!-- page 8 -->

society that is crushing her, and strikes back the women who scorn her,
by using her power to influence for evil, their sons, husbands and brothers, 
who still follow her, love her and secretly associate with her.</p>

<p>Next, let us endeavor to trace out, if possible, some of the many ways
leading from what is called good, respectable society, to the domain of
ostracism, prostitution and ill fame, and discover the causes that induce
so many women to walk in them. It will not do to assume, as society evidently 
does, that these women are prostitutes from choice, selecting this
mode of life because of their own depraved tendencies. Let us rather
examine carefully and critically the construction of society, and perhaps
we may find too heavy burdens resting on the shoulders of the weak and
helpless. When "the truth comes uppermost," it may show us that society 
is the real culprit, and that the Magdalen is "more sinned against
than sinning." That there may be some naturally passionate, amorous
girls, who rebel against conventional rules, and seek from choice a place
where their sexual desires may be indulged without restraint, I do not
deny; but I think such cases are very rare. Passionate women are not a
product of our present civilization,&mdash;a fact that husbands whine over
most dolefully.</p>

<p>There is a law of heredity, well understood among stock breeders, that
in order to establish and maintain desirable points and qualities in their
stock it is necessary to breed only from such animals as have these points
and qualities prominent and well developed; or, on the other hand, if it
is desirable to eliminate and get rid of certain qualities, it is only necessary 
to select for breeding purposes such animals as are poorly endowed
therewith. In accordance with this law, the practice pursued by society 
of weeding out the ardent, passionate girls, and selecting for motherhood 
only the cold and passive ones, has produced its legitimate effect,
in giving us a race of passionless women, so poorly endowed sexually,
that their husbands feel justified in seeking pleasanter relations elsewhere. 
For this reason, I believe that this immense army of prostitutes
contains only a very small percentage of volunteers. I believe that the
great majority of these women are forced into the ranks of prostitution
after honestly and earnestly struggling against it. I also believe, and
propose to show that both our industrial and social systems tend directly
to force working girls into this way of living, by making it always very
hard, and often quite impossible for them to obtain a livelihood by honest 
industry, and that monogamic marriage, more than anything else, is
responsible for it.</p>

<p>The pitiful wages received by women for work performed have more to
do with prostitution than many people think. Barely enough to sustain
them comfortably while they are healthy and work every day; but leaving 
them to beg, or do worse, whenever sickness, dull times, or bad luck
of any sort overtakes them. The working woman who would live on her

<!-- page 9 -->

daily wages must confine herself to the bare necessities of life, and never
know the luxury of aiding another. She may see her sisters, her parents
or her children suffering from cold and hunger, but the price of her labor 
is not enough to enable her to relieve them. There is one way, and
one only, in which a woman so situated, can find food and fire for her
loved ones; there is always a ready purchaser for that pearl of great
price, her "virtue." Indeed, I have no doubt there are many women
among us, whom we treat with scorn and call prostitutes, who have become 
such through maternal or filial devotion, so true and unselfish
that angels, looking from above and seeing their motives, would pronounce 
the deed consecration rather than prostitution.</p>

<p>It has been said, and truly too: "All that a man hath will he give for
his life," and with equal truth the same may be said of woman; so, when
we consider the weary, hopeless lives of working girls in shops and factories; 
going home at night, after long hours of toil, to lonely attics
or cheap and cheerless boarding houses,&mdash;poorly fed, poorly warmed
and poorly clothed, and above all, feeling themselves wronged, neglected
and uncared for,&mdash;can we wonder that they lose hope and courage, and
recklessly barter their birthright for a mess of pottage? The struggle
for life is too much for them, and they seem doomed from the beginning.
I meet pale, sad, discouraged girl-faces on the streets every day, and I
know the tempter stands waiting for them on every street corner, smiling
to deceive and alluring to betray. It is not the sweet lipped seducer,
flattering girlish vanity, but an experienced man of the world who has
gold to back his suit, an employer of girls, perhaps, who has grown rich
on the labor of half paid women. It is an unequal contest of wealth
against want, of strength against weakness, of man against woman.</p>

<p>Society is so excessively nice about keeping the social evil covered up
and out of sight, that the poor girl who has passed the enchanted land of
pleasure, and reached that stage in the prostitute's career, where it "biteth 
like a serpent and stingeth like an adder," the suffering one, who
carries in her face the sickening evidence of disease and dissipation, can
hardly walk our streets without being arrested by some watchful policeman, 
hurried out of sight, and perhaps locked up, for having made a
spectacle of her unhappy self; while the fresh and blooming wanton may
parade her smiles, her fine dresses and costly jewels, either in handsome
carriage or fashionable promenade, as much and as often as she pleases,
and the guardians of morality and propriety look on admiringly without
a word of censure or rebuke: thus hiding from young and inexperienced
girls, who are being sorely tried and tempted, the worst features of prostitution, 
and permitting them to see only the shining raiment in which
Easy Virtue is wont to array herself. In this way all the avenues leading 
to sexual prostitution are made to look broad and inviting. To the
weary, overtasked woman they give a promise of rest, to the shivering

<!-- page 10 -->

they offer shelter, to the famished, food, and to the desolate, companionship. 
I have sometimes questioned whether the whole masculine world
were not leagued together in this business. It certainly looks enough
like it to justify suspicion. The ordained minister receives a generous
fee for performing the marriage ceremony, calls infidelity to marital obligations 
a terrible sin, and teaches patience and submission. The women
of his flock receive his words as gospel-truth; the men pay his salary
and "laugh in their sleeves." Large manufacturers, who employ women
conspire to keep the price of work at a starvation level. Small manufacturers, 
not all, but many of them, knowing it impossible for their help to
live on the wages paid them, play pander and introduce their gentleman
friends. Our city fathers dexterously hide the repulsive features of the
unholy and unnatural traffic in womanhood, and allow its gilded allurements 
to shine forth conspicuously. All these parties seem to be acting
in concert, with a deliberate purpose to provide abundant supplies for
the libertine's feast. After the banquet municipal laws and police courts
come in, like menials, to sweep up the fragments, cart away the stale
meat and bury the bones. I do not say for a truth this is so; I would
rather think otherwise, but of this much I am sure, <i>if</i> "the boot were
on the other foot," <i>if</i> five hundred thousand young men were seduced
and secluded by American matrons, visited secretly in midnight revel
and lewd debauch, kept as a reserve force to supply sexual demands not
met in legal wedlock, our women would be thought about mean enough
for any thing, and monogamic marriage would soon be known for what
it really is,&mdash;a delusion and a snare.</p>

<p>In saying that marriage is largely responsible for the low wages of women, 
I am not running a tilt against that union which exists only in the
dreams of poets. I mean marriage as it is exemplified in common usage,
and defined in common law; where the woman is "given in marriage,"
and becomes a servant without wages in her husband's home. That a
class of unpaid laborers will degrade any branch of industry in which
they toil, has already been so clearly and forcibly shown in other departments, 
that we have only to apply the same logic to this one, and the
point is carried. In the old days, when the abolition of negro slavery in
the South was an unsettled question, we were told that slave labor tended
to make the laboring white man poor and keep him so; and that free labor 
never can compete with slave labor without reducing the free laborer
to a condition very little better than slavery. Understanding this principle, 
Northern working men are forming leagues to resist the encroachment 
of convict labor, knowing that the kind of work done by unpaid
convicts will be so cheapened and degraded that free labor will be driven
from the field. Now, just as slave labor operates against free labor, just
as the prison system of offering cheap convict labor injures honest working 
men, just so wife labor affects free working women. It is the character 

<!-- page 11 -->

rather than the name of anything that makes it either good or ill.
The injury to labor is caused by having a class of unpaid laborers to
compete with; and whether that class be called slave, convict, or wife,
the ruinous effect on free labor remains unchanged.</p>

<p>I am well aware that wives are not generally considered or thought of
as a class of laborers, the popular opinion being that wives are a nonproducing 
class depending for support on the labor of their husbands.
Many husbands, otherwise intelligent, whose wives toil early and late,
honestly and conscientiously take to themselves the whole credit of supporting 
their families, and not unfrequently their hard working, overtasked 
wives share the delusion. Wives have worked so long without
wages, that "women's work," sweeping, dusting, cooking, etc.&mdash;the never
ending routine of housework that must be done in every home, is not regarded 
as labor exactly. It is an inferior grade, lacking the dignity and
importance of man's labor, and when performed by a wife in her husband's 
house, has no financial value.</p>

<p>There is, however, another way in which wife labor tends to reduce the
wages of working girls. The germ of independence has quickened in the
hearts of a large majority of the wives of this age. They feel bitterly the
humiliation of being obliged to ask for every dime they may need, to explain 
just what they wish to buy with it, and then argue the case to convince 
their husbands that the purchase is really necessary; and to avoid
the necessity of frequent begging, they go out to the work-shops and get
sewing to do at home. They cannot leave home and work in the shops,
and in order to get the work they are obliged to underbid the shop-girl
and reduce her already low wages a little lower still. Married women,
doing cheap work at home, make it possible for manufacturers, to get
fine, white shirts made for a dollar a dozen, and other kinds of shop-work 
at proportionally low rates. Full of their own sorrows, and adopting 
the only method they can find to better their own condition, wives
have crowded into this field of labor, destroyed the business of the shop-girl, 
compelled her to work more hours for less pay, and driven her to
want, poverty, destitution and prostitution.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be thought incredible that the condition of working
girls is as bad as I have represented. I tell you it is even worse! it can
never be told, but must be endured to be understood! Human speech
cannot voice the long drawn out agony of a life, robbed of all the hopes
and pleasures that make up the joy of living, and forced into a treadmill
of constant toil for a bare subsistence. The best years of my life have
been dragged out in a New Hampshire cotton mill, so I know what I am
talking about. New England people are naturally proud of their manufactories, 
and many of them seem to think these are run by water power
alone. This is a mistake; the water power only propels the machinery.
Another force is requisite to make the machinery effective. A deep, full

<!-- page 12 -->

current of human life is constantly pouring in, as freely as the water and
almost as fast. Women and children especially, are being used up and
worn out with a rapidity unthought of by those who look only on the
surface of things. If the blood of all the victims, whose lives have been
crushed and broken in the mills that stand on its banks, were spilled in
its tide, the Merrimac river would flow on towards the Atlantic, as red as
were the waters of the Seine on the morning of St. Bartholomew. But
blood-spilling is barbarous, and puritanical New England never tolerates
barbarism. She freely grants to Capital a "bond" that enables it to
take from Labor the "pound of flesh," but, because of her pious, puritan 
faith in her own righteousness, bloodshed is forbidden. The Yankee
Shylock, however, has more inventive genius than the old Jew, and finds
a way to enforce his bond without either breaking the law or shocking
public sentiment. Human strength and endurance are put to work
against tireless machinery, in gas-poisoned rooms, until the flesh wastes
and the cheek pales as the red blood is gradually transmuted into sweat
and tears, and a used up operative quietly passes away to make room for
a fresh hand. All the proprieties observed, and every thing done "decently 
and in order."</p>

<p>I have no fault to find with the work in a cotton factory, in and of itself. 
A reasonable amount of work, a reasonable number of hours for a
day's labor, and reasonable wages therefor would make of mill-work
pleasant and healthful employment. As it is, corporate greed has assigned 
to each operative too much work,&mdash;too many spindles, too many
frames, too many looms etc., and insisted on too many hours in the day,
and in the meantime little by little has reduced wages, till these mills, instead 
of being "hives of industry," as they are sometimes called, are become 
hells of torture where men are overworked, women are enslaved,
and children sacrificed.</p>

<p>When I say that overwork and low wages virtually force working girls
to prostitution, I do not make the assertion without having evidence to
sustain it. In this matter I "speak of what I do know, and testify of
what I have seen." Born a Campbell, backed by a long line of hardy,
Scotch ancestry, I was endowed with more power of physical endurance
than falls to the common lot of women; consequently, I have been able
to stand by my looms, year after year, while one relay after another of
fresh help came into the room, worked a few years, grew sick and feeble
from overwork, and at last were obliged to give up and yield their places
to fresh hands. I have seen young girls come into the mill, buxom and
bonnie, right from their country homes, watched them as they faded year
by year, and finally go back to their homes, broken in spirit, health
gone,&mdash;invalids for the rest of their lives. I have observed others, of different 
make and temperament, whose natures were such that it was utterly 
impossible for them to patiently bend their necks and take on the

<!-- page 13 -->

yoke of hard labor. The allotment of work to each worker is measured
according to the capacity of skillful, capable women, and nature had not
endowed the "gumption" enough to entitle them to rank in this 
class. They were pretty girls, generous, amiable and good girls, but they
lacked the tact and skill requisite to perform their daily tasks, and failure
fretted and discouraged them. They grew restive and reckless as
the burdens of their lot pressed too heavily upon them, did their work
badly and were often absent, were found fault with and fined, and at last
discharged; and very soon after that I met them on the street wearing
the "livery of shame."</p>

<p>But I did not allow my acquaintance to end thus. I
had begun to have radical opinions, and to judge people by their merits
rather than by what was said about them. These women were my
friends, and I knew the evil that had befallen them was their misfortune,
but not their fault. One in particular, a "wee, winsome lassie," who
had worked close beside me, I was especially interested in. She was one
of those sweet, gentle darlings, who blossom out in beauty and loveliness,
beloved and petted by all who know them, happy themselves and
making others so, when born into homes of comfort and plenty, but who,
in the atmosphere of poverty and hardship, soon sink into infamy or the
grave. I won her trust and confidence by giving her what little help I
could about her work, while her childish helplessness so appealed to my
sympathy that I thought of her as my little sister. She did the very best
she was able, but each loom was a "harp of a thousand strings," and the
strings broke and tangled till she grew nervous and almost frantic. She
could not weave, and she spoiled so much cloth, that, though my heart
ached for the poor girl, I could not blame the overseer when he discharged 
her. Then followed a long and fruitless search for another place
to work, till at length, hopeless and desperate she sold herself to a "respectable," 
married man who had for some time been watching and waiting 
for just this opportunity. From this to the brothel the step was, in
her case, a short one, and there I found her.</p>

<p>I had two motives in visiting homes. First, I
liked them, and wanted them to know it. I wanted to help them to
maintain their own self-respect, and make them hope and watch for a
chance to escape from their bad surroundings, and try the game of life
over again in some other way. Divorce occasionally frees a woman from
the bondage of legal prostitution, and I would say to every woman who
has fallen a victim to the illegal sort: break loose from unlawful bondage, 
and go free at the first opportunity, without asking leave of Madame
Grundy or anybody else. Then again, I wanted to learn something definite 
about the prostitute's life. I had become conscious of a great
wrong, a terrible injustice, somewhere in our civilization; something that
degraded and made merchandise of the sexual nature of woman in every

<!-- page 14 -->

department of social life. I did not then comprehend where this evil
originated, nor who was to blame for it; so I investigated in all directions.
I had been a wife and viewed marriage from the inside, and here was my
opportunity to interview its twin monster, prostitution.</p>

<p>Statistics tell us that the average length of the prostitute's life is five
years, but as to the cause that so soon destroys life, we are left in the
dark. We cannot believe it is the sexual commerce, in and of itself, for
we know that the same men who associate with the harlot, also mingle
freely in the home life of the pure, the virtuous, and the good. The patrons 
of one class of women are the husbands of the other; so, unless a
"fountain can at the same time send forth sweet and bitter waters,"
these men cannot carry disease and death to the brothel, without also
bringing disease and death to their homes.</p>

<p>I wish I could present to you the picture, as it has been revealed to
me, of the perils and persecutions that pursue the foot-steps of the prodigal 
daughter while traveling the downward road to ruin and death. Let
me try, and perhaps I can show the causes that induce premature death.
We will take the case of one, neither better nor worse than her sister women: 
she has fallen in the struggle for subsistence, and, turning her
back on all she has hitherto valued in life, her hope, her pride, her good
name and her self-respect, she forsakes want and accepts shame; leaves
a cold and cheerless room and goes to a home of luxury and splendor;
changes her shabby garments for fine and costly raiment, and eats till
she is satisfied, without a fear that to-morrow's bread will not be forthcoming. 
She now lives in a "high toned," fancy establishment, one that
is patronized by gentlemen who make up our first class in society; she
is, for the time being, a favorite with the habitues of the place, and has
plenty of leisure and plenty of cash; she is surrounded with pleasant associates, 
and is courted, flattered and caressed; she revels in luxurious
indolence, and declares herself a fortunate and happy woman. Were it
not for an unspoken feeling of sadness and shame, when she remembers
that she is scorned and despised by virtuous people, she might, perhaps,
be satisfied and content.</p>

<p>But a favorite in a brothel is such only till new faces appear; and because 
the same forces that conspired to bring her to this place, are still
operating to bring in others, it is not long until she sees the fond attentions 
she has hitherto received transferred to new arrivals. She very
soon comprehends the "true inwardness " of the situation, and begins to
regard those about her with suspicion. Gradually the house gets too
full and she is made to feel herself one too many; so she prepares for a
change, and sets about finding another boarding place. She is cordially
welcomed in another house, but when there, discovers that she has taken
another step downward. She realizes that she has been crowded out of
the choice place, and that she has crowded some one below herself, who,

<!-- page 15 -->

in consequence of this constant pressure, caused by the coming in of new
recruits, has displaced another lower still. She soon learns that there
are as many different grades in houses of ill fame as there are different
classes of men in the community, and that the woman who finds her way
into a first class house, is, as soon as she ceases to be a "winning card"
there, crowded out and obliged to seek shelter in one of a lower grade:
being systematically forced down, down, ever downward, nor is she permitted 
to halt nor rest, until she reaches the very last and lowest den of
drunkenness and debauch.</p>

<p>She is now in a second class house, patronized by second class men,
and begins to taste the bitterness of prostitution. She comprehends the
full horror of her position, and O, if she only could, how gladly would
she go back to hard labor again. To escape the terrible fate she sees before 
her, she would welcome the hardest task, and the plainest fare, and
endure them, if she must, until death released her. But this cannot be;
the door to honest industry is barred and bolted against the prostitute;
and besides, there is a demand for her lower down. The men who compose 
the lower classes are just as hungry for human flesh as their richer
neighbors, and just as firm believers in the doctrine that "woman was
made for man," but, lacking the wealth wherewith to work the ruin of
unfortunate girls, the brothels they frequent are kept full by receiving
the discarded inmates from those of a higher grade. Every move is
downward! The road to ruin grows darker and more dismal at every
step, but she can neither stop nor turn back. The power that "regulates 
prostitution" is heard in the voice of a policeman, crying "move
on, <i>move on!</i> don't block up the way, make room for others, <span class="smcap">move on</span>!"
and if she does not move on, quickly too, she is arrested, dragged before
a police court, fined and perhaps given a few months in jail.</p>

<p>Nine out of every ten of the noisy quarrels and fights, among the inmates 
of brothels, are caused by the persistent refusal to "move on," of
some poor, desperate creature, who is crazed and maddened by the prospect 
before her. She began her career of prostitution in the society of
men who were, perhaps, her superiors in education and social culture,
has found her peers and passed them in her gradual descent, and now
the men she is compelled to associate with, are so coarse and brutal that
she shrinks from them, and dares the consequences of a brawl rather
than step to a lower level. Wild, reckless and defiant, careless of herself, 
she takes to whiskey or morphine, rushing madly on, hating and hated, 
fighting her way with "tooth and nail" against fearful odds. At
every turn she is met by an officer of the law, who hurries and jostles
her along, arresting her often and clubbing her sometimes, forcing her
on and down until the "last ditch" receives her.</p>

<p>This officer is not any more cruel than the civilization he represents.
He is simply doing his duty according to laws framed for the especial

<!-- page 16 -->

purpose of "regulating the social evil," and maintaining a show of order 
and respectability. This business of regulating the social evil takes
on an appearance of morality and virtue that is misleading and hypocritical 
in the highest degree. The laws claiming to regulate prostitution
have no kindly consideration for the poor prostitute. They were made
by men, for the convenience of men; the secrecy and safety of men in
the pursuit of sexual pleasure being their only end and aim. The danger 
to masculine secrecy consists in the tendency of prostitutes to become 
too numerous, to be on friendly terms with each other, to visit back
and forth, and gossip about their patrons. To prevent this the regulating 
process must be worked so as to keep the death rate just high
enough to balance the increase. There must always be a pretext for the
arrest and punishment of these women; and they are dealt with harshly
or otherwise, just in proportion as they menace the safety or contribute
to the enjoyment of the "men about town." It is something like a log-drive 
on a river: the girls are the logs, their environment the madly
rushing waters, and police officers are the men stationed along the banks
with spike-poles to keep them in the current and hasten them on to perdition, 
lest a jam should occur and society be scandalized thereby.</p>

<p>I have dealt with this subject chiefly in its bearings on working girls,
because I know it best in this direction. Different influences may operate 
to ensnare other classes of women, but, whether it be destitution,
seduction or amorous tendencies, when once drawn into this whirlpool
of death, there is no difference in the treatment they receive from society
and government. Ostracised by society, outlawed by government,
haunted by old memories, abused by their patrons, hunted and harrassed
by the police, arrested, fined, imprisoned,&mdash;is it any wonder they die?</p>

<p>"None are so blind as those who will not see," but, refusing to see an
unpleasant truth does not make it less true. We may resolutely shut
our eyes and try to persuade ourselves that our conjugal relations are
regulated on a monogamic basis; may proudly point to our schools and
churches, our advance in art and literature, our wonderful inventions,
our immense manufactories and extensive commerce, our importance as
a nation and our growth as a people; but, whether we recognize it or
not, the awful fact is before us, that sexual prostitution, the social evil,
this monstrous maelstrom of perdition is continually circling and seething 
in our midst; carrying down to its fathomless depths one hundred
thousand women every year. Social ostracism and legal persecution
give to these waters of death their fearful impetus, while industrial injustice, 
poverty and want push and crowd the victims into the dreadful
vortex.</p>

<p>This is a terrible picture, and yet it only feebly portrays the more terrible 
reality, carefully hidden and covered up as some shameful thing,
but at the same time sustained, perpetuated and considered necessary

<!-- page 17 -->

for the preservation of outward decency and good order: prostitution being 
regarded as a sort of under-ground sewer, through which escapes so
much of the lewdness and sensualism generated in totally depraved human 
natures, that the upper stories of our social structure are fit dwelling 
places for virtuous wives and legitimate children.</p>

<p>We are told by those who deprecate all agitation of the social question, 
that it will inevitably destroy the home, and that the home is essential 
for the best interests of children; that to make home what it should
be, there must be but one lawful wife, who is the mother of the children
and the mistress of the home. They grow eloquent over the advantages
and excellences of monogamy, besides investing it with a great deal of
religious sanctity, which they somehow gather to themselves and absorb
as they proceed, until they really seem to glow with goodness. The question
of prostitution they shun if possible, but if pressed, will solemnly
say that it is inevitable, and must be tolerated as an escape valve for the
passions of men that would otherwise make it unsafe for our wives and
daughters to walk the public streets. It is the price of virtue, and virtue 
must be protected at whatever cost. In other words, prostitutes are
the mudsills upon which the home is builded, and without them monogamic 
marriage would fall in ruins.</p>

<p>Now, if the prostitute is just as necessary to the welfare of society as
the wife, then her calling is just as honorable and she is entitled to equal
consideration. If she is forbidden the joy of motherhood that wives may
possess their homes and their children in safety, if her shame is the price
of their honor, her crucifixion, their redemption; surely, instead of being 
driven by cruel treatment to premature death, she should receive due
protection during her time of useful service and be kindly cared for in
her old age. I would suggest a pension equal to that paid to wounded
and disabled soldiers. Such a proposition may be startling at first, but
sober, second thought will show that it is in perfect harmony with the
popular idea of a money value in the sexuality of woman, which underlies 
our entire social system, finds legal expression in statute law, is acknowledged 
in the marriage contract, and is recognized in every court
where money is awarded to a defrauded husband, just as much as it is in
the business transactions of a brothel.</p>

<p>It sems so clear to me that all our laws, customs and traditions bearing 
on the relations of the sexes, had their rise in barbarism that I wonder 
all do not recognize the fact. The status of the wife, like that of the
prostitute, was established before the thought of women's rights had entered 
the mind of any one. The passional gratification of man being the
chief consideration, our laws regulating marriage were not framed for
the protection of the wife, the education of the children, nor the welfare
of the home, but to protect each man from the encroachments of all other
men and insure him the peaceable possession of the woman he claimed;

<!-- page 18 -->

consequently, as civilization advances all these laws must be either
wholly repealed or largely modified. Much has already been done in
this direction, but much more must be accomplished before woman occupies 
her rightful place, side by side with man, his acknowledged peer
in all things. The divine right of man to rule over woman is no longer
accepted as a theory, and in good time all the old statutes in accordance
therewith will be numbered among the "blue laws." The woman suffrage 
advocates claim for woman the rights of citizenship; the labor reformers 
ask for her equal chance and opportunity in all the avenues of
business; Free Lovers demand for her the ownership of herself and the
emancipation from sexual bondage: all these demands are included in
woman's equality, and when they are gained will give us a sure foundation 
on which to build a higher and better order of social and domestic 
life.</p>

<p>No thinking person, who is also a philanthropist, will willingly accept
the theory that prostitution is inevitable, or rest satisfied until a social
system is evolved so completely in harmony with our human nature that
there will no longer exist in man a demand for the prostitution of woman. 
But in order to achieve this, there must be full and free opportunity 
for discussion and investigation. We know that, not only prostitution, 
but nearly every case of marital discord has its root in the strange
disparity that exists in the sexual needs and desires of husbands and
wives; and we ask, is this a normal condition? Are husbands excessive
in their demands, or wives morbid in their apathy; or, are they each
equally divergent from a natural condition? Is not this disparity the
result of the slavish position held by woman in the sexual partnership?
In a condition of perfect equality, would not woman develop to a sexual
status more nearly approaching that of man? Would not association
with a healthy, womanly woman be so much more satisfactory and beneficial 
to a man, that all abnormal desire would subside, and his treatment 
of woman be more manly and just? Would not a larger endowment 
of sexual power, on the part of women, fit them to become better
wives and happier mothers of healthier children? These are some of
the questions the members of this League propose to talk about, and to
keep on talking about them until people wake up to the fact that they
are of vital interest to human welfare. We come to the consideration of
these subjects with clean hands and pure motives, and our good work
will go on regardless either of ridicule or slander.</p>

<p>I would like above all things to see this hitherto impassable gulf between 
the wife and the courtesan, dug by jealousy and hate and kept
open by prejudice and ignorance, so effectually bridged over that each
would regard the other as a sister and co-laborer instead of a rival and
enemy. The one is termed virtuous the other fallen, one is honorable
the other infamous, but both are women and both are filling positions

<!-- page 19 -->

provided for and forced upon them by old customs and superstitions that
had their origin when men were little better than savages. Both are
actually bought and sold in the sexual market, regulated and governed
by laws they have no voice in making, and by circumstances they cannot
control. If these two classes of women could be persuaded to forget
their antagonism, and join hands in an effort to aid and help each other,
the woman's rights movement would at once march on to success and
victory. But so long as wives believe all their husbands tell them of the
awfully awful badness of the Magdalen, believe her to be the incarnation
of profligacy and sin, a terror to every wife, a temptation to every husband, 
and a danger to every home; and Magdalen, in her turn, listens
to the same husband, hears the pitiful story of his domestic infelicity, of
his wife's cold indifference, her exacting selfishness, her frivolity and
heartlessness, and is made to believe that the wife's jealousy and spite
are the causes of the social ostracism under which she suffers, so long
will the cause of woman present the hopeless spectacle of a "house divided 
against itself."</p>

<p>I can see no good reason why these women should not "pool their issues," 
and work together for their common welfare. The doctrine of woman's 
inferiority is responsible for the wrongs of both, and the struggle
now in progress for woman's equality needs and should have their united 
support. They both love the same man, and both are wronged and
deceived by the same individual. He flatters each one in turn, and then
goes straightway to the other with his mouth full of slander. He arranges
and plans the lives of both in a way to suit his own comfort and convenience, 
giving little thought to the wishes and desires of either. He systematically 
deceives both, believing that his own safety depends on
keeping them estranged and separate, and yet, in his way, he loves both
and does not dream that he is wronging either. He follows blindly in
the foot-steps of his orthodox father, taking especial care not to repeat
the sin of Adam by hearkening unto the voice of his wife. If these two
women could come together on a friendly footing and compare notes, the
chances are he would hear some wholesome truths, and perhaps be ready
to take hold of the question of social reform, in a spirit more meek and
tractable than the average husband is wont to manifest.</p>

<p>Just imagine ourselves met here in a liberal convention, with about a
dozen earnest, thoughtful women from neighboring brothels, bringing to
our aid all the wisdom and knowledge of the world they have gained
through experience and observation, and then picture the change they
would make in our programme. How many men, think you, in the presence 
of those who know all about the dark side of their lives, would dare
get up and express the opinion that women would behave badly in a condition 
of social freedom, and picture a state of social anarchy and licentiousness, 
in which wives would all become wanton, and mothers be unable 

<!-- page 20 -->

to tell who are the fathers of their children. These slanderous insults 
to womanhood, that have been mouthed over and over until they
have grown stale in the using, would forever remain unspoken, and
brassy impudence and falsehood would for once modestly take a back
seat and keep quiet.</p>

<p>Now I am not saying that the monogamic relation is not the highest
form of conjugal life. I simply say that the men of this day and generation 
are not developed to a plane high enough to make this phase of conjugality 
practical; that whether practiced openly as in Utah, or secretly
as in Massachusetts, polygamy, in some guise, is the almost universal
practice of Christendom; and that the make-believe monogamy we have
among us is a hideous sham, bought with prostitution and clothed with
hypocrisy and lies.</p>

<p>The fact that five hundred thousand abandoned women are continually
with us, every little town and village having its due proportion, is sufficient
proof that the husband who keeps his marriage vows is an exception 
to the general rule. All these women are either seduced or bought
into the ranks of prostitution by somebody; somebody sustains them in
their business, pays for their food and raiment, and wears them out at
the rate of a hundred thousand a year. In the face of all this we find
men who have the effrontery to profess to believe that the agitation of
the social question will injure the good morals of the community, and ask
for laws to suppress it. They are blind to the libertinism of the rest of
the nation, but for the polygamy of Utah they invoke severe legislation.
Ministers and statesmen alike are straining at the Mormon gnat and
swallowing the orthodox camel. Not until the superfluous wives of Mormondom 
are legislated down to a level with prostitutes will these righteous 
men be content,&mdash;and all in the name of virtue. In the name of
virtue! O, men, fathers and brothers, how long will you deceive yourselves 
and try to deceive us? You claim to be generous towards woman,
and yet you systematically deceive and defraud her. You affect great
regard for virtue, while your own is neglected and forgotten. You
regulate industry in a way that crushes her, excludes her altogether from
many kinds of remunerative labor, gives her less pay than man receives
for the same work, then you figure in the sex market as a buyer, and yet
tell us you deplore prostitution.</p>

<p>"More in sorrow than in anger" I tell you these things, for I know
that tyranny and wrong are the heritage of both man and woman,
handed down in the customs and institutions of past ages, but it is not
the part of wisdom to endure them longer. The demand of this age is
for exact and impartial justice, justice between man and man, and justice 
between man and woman, always remembering that all assumptions
of generosity are but so many insults, until justice is fully satisfied.</p>
